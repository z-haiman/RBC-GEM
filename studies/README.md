# Publication case studies

This directory contains publication-related scripts and functions. Notebooks in this directory are often one-time use and do not get updated with later versions of the RBC-GEM.

Some folders may be compressed in an effort to save space. Others may be too big for GitHub. Consequently, all items associated with a study can be found in the corresponding Zenodo.
Be sure to unzip all folders compressed associated with a study and double check filepaths for this reason!

## rbc1
Contains relevant data and notebooks to reproduce figures in the RBC-GEM publication. GitHub LFS is necessary for zip files. Zenodo is also used for archiving this study due to size of some files. DOI 10.5281/zenodo.14651759
