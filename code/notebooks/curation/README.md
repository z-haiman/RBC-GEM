# Model curation

This directory contains curation-related scripts and functions used to make changes to the RBC-GEM repository. Notebooks in this directory are often one-time use and do not get updated with later versions of the RBC-GEM. 

Deprecated code is eventually moved to the [.deprecated directory](../../../.deprecated/).
