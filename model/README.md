# RBC-GEM model and annotation files

This directory contains the RBC-GEM model and annotation files.


## Model

The model is available as `.xml`, `.xlsx`, `.txt`, `.yml`, and `.mat`. Note that only the `.yml` version is available on branches other than `main` (e.g., `develop`), to facilitate tracking of model changes.


## Reaction, Metabolite, and Gene Annotations

Additional annotation information and external identifiers for RBC-GEM reactions, metabolites, and genes are provided as `tsv` files. The structure of the `tsv` files are tabulated below.
