name: "✏️ Propose curation"
about: If you want to suggest a specific change to the model (e.g. new reaction, correct
  gene association, remove duplicate metabolite).

<!-- Note: Based on issue templates for standard-GEMs (e.g., Human-GEM, Yeast-GEM). -->

<!-- Note: Please search to see if an issue already exists for the curation you propose. -->

<!-- Make sure you use the latest RBC-GEM version. -->

#### Brief description:
<!-- A concise description on what curation you are proposing and for what purpose. Provide links to website or references that support your statement. For instance: "In yeast-GEM the reaction for 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase is split into two half-reactions, as the second half-reaction is spontaneous. However, the spontaneous half-reaction is incorrectly assigned to a wrong enzyme. See https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P04173 and https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P38891 for the two enzymes, and https://iubmb.qmul.ac.uk/enzyme/EC1/1/1/85.html for the spontaneous half-reaction.

If you just want to report a problem with the model, but do not have a precise idea on how this should be fixed, then it might be better to use the "Bug report" issue type (link to change this is above "Title").
-->

#### Current status:
<!-- Show what is the current status in the model of the reaction/metabolite/gene etc. that you propose to curate. If suitable, this can be done in table format, choose yourself what data is most informative to show (do not include more than necessary):

Identifier | Reaction equation | Genes
---|---|---
r_0061 | (2R,3S)-3-isopropylmalate[c] + NAD[c] => (2S)-2-isopropyl-3-oxosuccinate[c] + H+[c] + NADH[c] | YCL018W
r_0029 | (2S)-2-isopropyl-3-oxosuccinate[c] + H+[c] => 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate[c] + carbon dioxide[c] | YJR148W

Alternatively, this can also be written out in bullet points, linking to Metabolic Atlas:

#### Proposed status/to-do list:
<!-- Give a very brief list of actions that need to be taken to curate the model. In some cases, it might be helpful to first show the proposed changes in table format:

Identifier | Reaction equation | Genes
---|---|---
r_0061 | (2R,3S)-3-isopropylmalate[c] + NAD[c] => (2S)-2-isopropyl-3-oxosuccinate[c] + H+[c] + NADH[c] | YCL018W
r_0029 | (2S)-2-isopropyl-3-oxosuccinate[c] + H+[c] => 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate[c] + carbon dioxide[c] |

But a to-do list should always be present:
- [ ] Leave r_0061 intact.
- [ ] Remove YJR148W from r_0029.
