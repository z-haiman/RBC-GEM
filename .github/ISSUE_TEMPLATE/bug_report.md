<!-- Note: Based on issue templates for standard-GEMs (e.g., Human-GEM, Yeast-GEM). -->

<!-- Note: Please search to see if an issue already exists for the bug you encountered. -->

<!-- Make sure you use the latest RBC-GEM version. -->

<!-- For convenience, when referring to a particular reaction/metabolite/gene identifiers,

#### Current behavior:
<!-- A concise description of what you're experiencing. Try to be as clear as possible: Is it something wrong/missing in the model? Is it a simulation issue? How does the reaction/metabolite/gene/simulation look like in the `main` branch? -->

#### Expected feature/value/output:
<!-- A concise description of what you expected to happen. How the reaction/metabolite/gene/simulation result should look (cite literature if needed). If you have a precise idea on how this should be fixed, then it might be better to use the "Propose curation" issue type (link to change this is above "Title").  -->

#### Reproducing these results:
<!-- If the bug is a result from simulation, model import/export or use of any of the functions in this repository, then make sure you report:
1. What operating system you use (Windows/Mac).
2. What version of Python/COBRApy or MATLAB/RAVEN/COBRA you use (provide what is relevant for your situation).
3. If a simulation result, also report the solver (Gurobi/glpk/CPLEX etc.).
3. What exact commands were done, so that we can try to reproduce the bug.
4. The exact error message that is shown.
-->

#### Anything else:
<!--
Links? References? Anything that will give us more context about the issue that you are encountering!
