### Brief explanation of proposed change
<!-- Please include an explanation of the change to be made. Try to be as concise as possible in this section, and elaborate as needed in the "Anything else" section below.

Example:

Inclusion of additional references for G6PD. Studies explore G6PD-deficient RBCs

PMID or DOI | Explanation | Title
---|---|---
PMID:16888458  | Important (possibly first) human study highlighting "G6PD-deficient individuals are able to perform short- and long-duration acute exercise without experiencing greater oxidative stress than non-G6PD-deficient individuals. Findings demonstrate "that despite the theoretically lower capacity of G6PD-deficient individuals to resist perturbations in their redox status, they are not more susceptible to oxidative stress" | Exercise-induced oxidative stress in G6PD-deficient individuals
PMID:19997026 | Follow-up study with additional results complimenting **PMID:16888458** | Comparison between glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient and normal individuals after eccentric exercise

#### Affected items
<!-- The PubMed ID or the DOI for the reference to be added/modified. Preferably, both can be supplied. If neither can be supplied, provide another method of access for the reference and a brief explanation for alternate access method.  If multiple articles are included in the change, consider using a table or a numerated list.

Entry | Type | PubMed ID  or DOI
---|---|---
G6PD | Gene | pubmed:16888458;pubmed:19997026
