## Deprecated 

This directory contains old scripts, data, models, log files, etc. that are no longer maintained or used. They are stored here rather than deleted to maintain a historical account of repository activity in an easily accessible and searchable location.

<span style="color:red">WARNING</span>: Code in this directory is unlikely to function as expected, and should not be modified. If a script or dataset is to be revived or updated in some way, it should be moved from this directory to the appropriate location in the repository. 

As an example, the paths to files utilized throughout the code are usually relative to the root directory of the RBC-GEM repository, therefore, file paths will likely not work after the scripts are deprecated and mvoed.
