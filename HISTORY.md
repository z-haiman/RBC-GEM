# History

### RBC-GEM 0.2.0
Updates to iAB-RBC-283 reconstruction for the following purposes:
1. To serve as a base/draft model for the initial expansion of iAB-RBC-283 to RBC-GEM.
2. To serve as a model for comparison to the new reconstruction.
3. To link to the HumanGEM reconstruction annotations where possible in the model.

No stoichiometric changes are made in this minor update, however BIGG identifiers are altered in order to enable better comparision to the RBC-GEM. Furthermore, associations to Recon3D and HumanGEM are made here, as subsequent changes past 0.2.0 will be in an effort to modernize to current COBRA standards before iterative expansion.

RBC-GEM 0.2.0 will remain identified as iAB-RBC-283 in order to help future comparisions.

### RBC-GEM 0.1.1
Repairs made to downloaded iAB-RBC-283 model, restoring it to a state similar to publication. Includes updating missing metabolite formulas, charges, and fixing identifiers

### RBC-GEM 0.1.0
First release of the RBC model in GitHub.
