# RBC-GEM data

This directory contains the RBC-GEM data files.

### deprecatedIdentifiers

* Contains the `tsv` files with reaction, metabolite, and gene annotations, identical to that in `/model/` for those identifiers that have been used in previous iterations RBC-GEM and subsequently removed. The identifiers are kept here so as to avoid accidentally reusing them in the future.

### external
Contains downloaded PDF files of various publications and unmodified supplemental files assoicated with datasets used in working with the RBC-GEM reconstruction. Even publications and their associated data may be unavailable over time (e.g., change to URL for a database). Archiving the relevant publications and publically available helps alleviate these difficulties.

### memote
Contains data relevant to MEMOTE experiments
