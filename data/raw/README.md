# RBC-GEM data/raw

This directory contains the interim RBC-GEM data files. It is intended to be used to store raw/initial data files that will be utilized, transformed, and/or processed in some capacity using subsequent code.

As a general guideline, this folder should always remain empty on _main_. Thea means any files that were temporarily committed here should be completely emptied by the next iteration update and before any pull-requests are made to the main branch.
