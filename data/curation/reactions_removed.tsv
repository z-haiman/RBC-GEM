79	NH4t3r	Ammonia transport via proton antiport	"Replaced by NH4c, NH4e, and NH3t. From UniProt Curation - Several mechanisms of transport has been proposed, namely electroneutral NH3 transport (pubmed:15572441, pubmed:19273840) and electroneutral NH4+/H+ exchange (pubmed:11861637, pubmed:19273840, pubmed:15572441).

148	PPPGO	Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (aerobic)	Removed from model. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase is a mitochondrial enzyme for heme synthesis, and healthy mature erythrocytes do not synthesize heme nor have mitochondria.
149	PUNP1	Purine-nucleoside phosphorylase (Adenosine)	Removed from model. The natural substrates of purine-nucleoside phosphorylase are inosine, guanosine, and their 2′-deoxy counterparts, but not adenosine nor deoxyadenosine. Xanthosine/xanthine havce also shown to be substrates of PNP (PMID:12180982). Some reports indicate low activitiy with (deoxy)adenosine (PMID:9305964), however it is more likely that adenine nucleosides and nucleotides are deaminated by adenosine deaminase and AMP deaminase to their corresponding inosine derivatives which, in turn, may be further degraded (PMID: 14706628)
150	RIBFLVt3	Riboflavin transport (ATP dependent)	No evidence of an ATP-dependent uptake system for riboflavin. Since RFVT1/2 are expressed in erythropoesis, it is possible that remnants of these proteins are responsible for riboflavin uptake. (PMID:5455272,DOI:10.1182/blood-2019-124380)
