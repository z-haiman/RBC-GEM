band_c	Band membrane protein (universal, erythrocyte -> 2.1,3,4.1)	Replaced by generic methylation reactions. Band 3 protein is a major methyl-accepting substrate of the intracellular erythrocyte PCMT1 (PMID: 7240192, PMID: 3828308)
bandmt_c	Band membrane protein (methylated, universal, erythrocyte -> 2.1,3,4.1)	Replaced by generic methylation reactions. Band 3 protein is a major methyl-accepting substrate of the intracellular erythrocyte PCMT1 (PMID: 7240192, PMID: 3828308)
bilglcur_c	Bilirubin monoglucuronide	Heme oxygenase occurs in macrophages. Furthermore, mature erythrocytes do not enzymatically degrade heme, heme degradation is from oxidative damage that under physiological conditions, does not form bilirubin. No evidence currently for  glucuronidation in erythrocytes.
bilglcur_e	Bilirubin monoglucuronide	Heme oxygenase occurs in macrophages. Furthermore, mature erythrocytes do not enzymatically degrade heme, heme degradation is from oxidative damage that under physiological conditions, does not form bilirubin. No evidence currently for  glucuronidation in erythrocytes.

f26bp_c	beta-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate	6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity are markedly influenced by the number of reticulocytes (PMID: 1667653). Furthermore, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 2 is absent from erytrhrocytes
gluala_e	5 L Glutamyl L alanine C8H13N2O5	Removed from model. Gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase is not involved in the transport of glutamyl-dipeptides (PMID:3593246, PMID:3593247). Furthermore, erythrocytes do not transport alpha-glutamyl-dipeptides (PMID: 3593246, PMID: 3593247). Dipeptide transport occurs via simple diffusion and futhermore, it was calculated that under normal physiological conditions the diffusive fluxes of circulating plasma peptides into human erythrocytes are too small for these cells to play a significant role in dipeptide catabolism (PMID: 2327979)
