2	bilglcur_c	Bilirubin monoglucuronide	"Heme oxygenase occurs in macrophages. Furthermore, mature erythrocytes do not enzymatically degrade heme, heme degradation is from oxidative damage that under physiological conditions, does not form bilirubin.

Furthermore, erythrocytes do not transport alpha-glutamyl-dipeptides (PMID: 3593246, PMID: 3593247).
