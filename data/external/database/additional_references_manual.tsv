0		Erythrocyte uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase deficiency identified by newborn screening for galactosemia in the United States	Eight infants (two whites and six blacks) with erythrocyte uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase (epimerase) deficiency were identified in four newborn screening programs for galactosemia in the United States. The initial biochemical findings in all cases were elevated blood galactose-l-phosphate with normal or only slightly increased blood galactose and normal galactose-l-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) activity. Epimerase deficiency was confirmed in erythrocytes by a two-step enzymatic assay involving fluorometric measurements of NADH generated by coupling the uridine diphosphate glucose dehydrogenase reaction to epimerase. Seven of the eight infants appeared to be clinically normal at birth and one newborn had neonatal jaundice. The infrequent recognition of epimerase deficiency is likely due to the methods of newborn screening for galactosemia which are often only for GALT deficiency and perhaps also due to incomplete follow-up of increased metabolite levels in newborn blood specimens with normal GALT activity. Our results confirm a preliminary report of a high frequency of erythrocyte epimerase deficiency in the American black population	eng	179	186	Screening	2	4	1993					"Won G.

1		Uridine-diphosphoglucose glucosyltransferase in human erythrocytes	"The presence of glucosyltransferase activity in mature human erythrocytes and leukocytes has been established both by demonstration of UDP formation from UDPG, and by incorporation of [14C] glucose from UDP-[14C] glucose into glycogen. The erythrocyte and leukocyte enzymes have similar properties and both require glucose 6-P for activity. The enzyme activity per white cell is about 400 times that per red cell. The erythrocyte glucosyltransferase activities did not differ from that in the normal in two patients with hepatic glucosyltransferase deficiency and in other patients with a variety of carbohydrate abnormalities."		27	32	Clinica Chimica Acta	12	1	1965	July				"Cornblath M, Steiner DF, Bryan P, King J"	"Journal, Article"	10.1016/0009-8981(65)90104-X					
2		"HUMAN ERYTHROCYTIC CYCLOPHILINS: ISOLATION, CHARACTERIZATION AND STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION"	"Two cyclosporin A (CsA) binding proteins were purified to homogeneity from human erythrocytes by consecutive steps of repeated gel chromatography, hydrophobic HPLC, ion exchange HPLC and reverse phase HPLC. Purified proteins I and II showed almost identical molecular masses and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activities which were completely abolished in the presence of CsA. On the other hand, pl values of the two proteins were distinctly different, 9.1 and 8.1, respectively, and the CsA-binding affinity (Kd) of protein I was 15.3 nM and that of II 25.0 nM. Amino acid sequence analysis of protein I in intact form has shown to be Val as the amino terminal residue of the protein, while no phenylthiohydantoinylated amino acid was detected in the sequence analysis of intact protein II, suggesting the presence of a modified or blocked amino acid at the amino terminus of the protein. The complete amino acid sequence of protein I was identified with [Phe��]-human cyclophilin A. Significantly high CsA-binding affinities of the present two proteins in human erythrocytes pose a problem of possible implication of CsA bound to such proteins in erythrocytes in pharmacology and/or toxicology of CsA through the blood cell fate."		213	219	Biomedical Research	17	3	1996					"Kurokawa N, Yamamoto K, Kadobayashi M, Arakawa Y, Sawada M, Ohishi T, Mochizuki T, Yanaihara N, Yanaihara C"	"Journal, Article"	10.2220/biomedres.17.213					
3		Partial Purification of D-Xylulokinase in Human Erythrocyes	"D-xylulokinase [EC 2. 7. 1. 17] was partialy purified from about 1 liter of acid-citrate-dixtrose (ACD) blood. A large portion of hemoglobin was removed by treatment with DEAE-cellulose, and then enzyme was purified by ammonium phosphate precipitation, calcium phosphate gel treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAF-cellulose column chromatography and the sephadex G-200 gel filtration. Four peaks were obtained by eluting with a linear gradient system of KCl concentration with the DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. It seemed that the peak I was hemoglobin and the peak IV was D-xylulokinase. D-xylulokinase was purified 2, 000-fold yielding 9.7mg. Its specific activity was 3 units per mg protein. The molecular weight of the peak IV was about 260, 000 as estimated by sephadex G-200 gel column chromatography. In the phospharylation of D-xylulose by this enzyme, pentose 5-phosphates were produced. Analysis of the reaction product indicate that the main component of the product was xylulose 5-pyosphate. Thus, the present study confirms the postulation that D-xylulose is first phosphorylated by xylulokinase and then metabolized through pentose phosphate pathway to lactic acid"		361	369	Journal of the Japan Society of Blood Transfusion	26	6	1980					"Watanabe S, Yoshikawa H"	"Journal, Article"	10.3925/jjtc1958.26.361

5		Hereditary Orotic Aciduria and Other Disorders of Pyrimidine Metabolism	"Pyrimidines and purines are the building blocks of DNA and RNA and are thus required for the retention and transmission of genetic information. In addition they function in the formation of coenzymes and active intermediates in carbohydrate and phospholipid metabolism. Purines and pyrimidines have two routes for nucleotide formation, the de novo pathway, which begins with ribose phosphate, amino acids, CO2, and ammonia; and the salvage pathway, which takes free bases and nucleosides back to nucleotides. De novo and salvage pathways are balanced and connected through the enzymes, which degrade the nucleotides to _-amino acids, CO2, and ammonia.In contrast to the well-known defects of purine metabolism, most of the seven defects of pyrimidine metabolism are recently discovered: hereditary orotic aciduria (UMP synthase deficiency; MIM 25890, 25892), pyrimidine 5_-nucleotidase deficiency (MIM 26612), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency (MIM 27427), dihydropyrimidinase (dihydropyrimidinuria, MIM), ureidopropionase deficiency, thymidine phosphorylase deficiency, and pyrimidine 5_-superactivity. Purine metabolism has an easily recognizable, easily measurable endpoint in uric acid. There is no equivalent compound in pyrimidine metabolism.The first defect, hereditary orotic aciduria, is in the de novo synthetic pathway. This autosomal recessive disorder results from a severe deficiency of the last two activities in the pathway, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine-5_-monophosphate decarboxylase. Although orotic aciduria was thought to be unique because of the loss of two enzymes, it is now known that these activities reside in separate domains of a single polypeptide coded by a single gene. This bifunctional protein, uridine-5_-monophosphate synthase, has been purified, the amino acid sequence determined by cDNA sequencing, and the gene localized to chromosome 3q13. Two point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions and loss of enzyme activity have been identified in one orotic aciduria patient.There are 15 known patients with hereditary orotic aciduria. All have had a macrocytic hypochromic megaloblastic anemia and orotic acid crystalluria. Thirteen have been treated with uridine with good effect in the majority. Five young adults remain well but require continued therapy. One adult has not received uridine therapy and is well despite persisting anemia. Other features have included renal tract obstruction by crystals, cardiac malformations, and strabismus. Infections have been a problem in some, associated with various abnormalities of in vitro tests of immune function. One patient had severe congenital abnormalities. Mild intellectual impairment has been an inconstant feature prior to treatment. The progressive neurologic deterioration in one young adult may be unrelated to the metabolic error.The other disorders involve defects in the pyrimidine degradative pathway. Deficiency of pyrimidine-5_-nucleotidase causes hemolytic anemia, possibly due to accumulation in erythrocytes of pyrimidine nucleotides, mostly uridine triphosphate (UTP) and cytidine triphosphate (CTP). The disorder is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner, and there is no specific treatment available. Pyrimidine 5_-nucleotidase superactivity has been described in four unrelated patients with developmental delay and neurologic abnormalities. The patients were treated with uridine with good effect. Deficiency of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase causes an increase in blood and urine levels of uracil and thymine. This deficiency is detected in a variety of clinical situations including pediatric metabolic screens for neurologic ..."	eng						2001						"Book, Section"	10.1036/ommbid.141		"Valle DL, Antonarakis S, Ballabio A, Beaudet AL, Mitchell GA"	The Online Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease	McGraw-Hill Education	9.78007E+12

8		Human erythrocyte ammonium transport is mediated by functional interaction of ammonium (RhAG) and anion (AE1) transporters.	"The ammonia/ammonium (NH3/NH4+) influx into red blood cells (RBCs) is mediated by surface glycoprotein RhAG that forms a structural complex with anion exchanger 1 (AE1, band 3). Owing to the activity of this complex, RBCs exposed to the isosmotic ammonium buffer swell and finally lyse. Isoosmotic NH4+-containing media alters the pH gradient in RBCs (intracellular alkalosis in response to NH3/NH4+influx) and triggers the AE1 activity resulting in redundant chloride and water influx and finally in cell swelling. Here we demonstrate that the ammonia/ammonium transport in human RBCs depends on the pH (pH optimum 7.4 �0.1), temperature (Q10 2.6 �0.3), HCO3_concentration (EC50 4.7 �0.3 mM), and AE1 function. The data confirm functional interactions between AE1 and RhAG. The initial velocity of cell swelling increased almost 50-fold in the isosmotic ammonium buffer containing 25 mM HCO3_(37�C) in comparison to the reaction in the same buffer without HCO3_. This indicates that the reaction is facilitated mostly by the carrier proteins, not just owing to the simple diffusion of NH3 across the erythrocyte membrane. We demonstrate that pHi reaches its maximum value much faster than the volume increase does. These data suggest that there is no direct correlation between pHi changes and the influx of NH3/NH4+. Taken together, our data show that the RhAG and AE1 complex activity enables erythrocytes to be ammonia/ammonium storage sites in order to maintain the physiological blood ammonia/ammonium equilibrium."		301	310	Biochemistry (Moscow) Supplement Series A: Membrane and Cell Biology	10	4	2016	Oct	1			"Sudnitsyna, JS, Skvertchinskaya, EA, Dobrylko IA, Nikitina ER, Krivchenko AI, Gambaryan SP, Mindukshev IV"	"Journal, Article"	10.1134/S1990747816040097					
9		Adenylosuccinate lyase from human erythrocytes	"1. Adenylosuccinate lyase (S-AMP lyase) (E.C. 4.3.2.2) has been purified 10,000-fold from human erythrocyte lysates. 2. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of S-AMP to AMP and fumarate, and the conversion of JV-(5-amino-l-ribosyl-4-imidazole carbonyl)-l-aspartic acid 5'-phosphate (S-AICA ribonucleotide) to 5-amino-l-ribosyl-4-imidazole carboxamide 5'-phosphate (AICA ribonucleotide) and fumarate. 3. The apparent Kms for S-AMP and S-AICA ribonucleotide were 2.3 _M and 3.5 _M respectively, in tricine buffer (pH 7.8). 4. AMP, AICA ribonucleotide and6-N succinoadenine were strong competitive inhibitors, fumarate was a comparatively weak non-competitive inhibitor, and orthophosphate was a weak competitive inhibitor."		497	503	International Journal of Biochemistry	6	7	1975	July				"Barnes BL, Bishop SH"	"Journal, Article"	10.1016/0020-711X(75)90030-0					
10		Model Human _ Thalassemic Erythrocytes: Effect of Unpaired Purified _-Hemoglobin Chains on Normal Erythrocytes�	"_ thalassemias arise from genetic defects that interfere with the synthesis of the _ hemoglobin chain and the subsequent production of the normal _2_2 hemoglobin tetramer. As a consequence of this decreased _-chain synthesis, unpaired _-hemoglobin chains are found within the red blood cell (RBC). The unstable _-chains are associated with a number of cellular defects, including: membrane-bound globin; membrane thiol oxidation; altered cytoskeletal proteins; decreased cellular and membrane deformability; and increased susceptibility to both endogenous and exogenous oxidants. Surprisingly, while significant injury to human thalassemic RBC arise from the unpaired _-chains, the underlying intra-RBC mechanisms are not easily studied in patient samples or in mouse models. To better study the fate of excess _-chains in human RBC, the model _ Thalassemic cell was developed. Model human _ thalassemic RBC is made by entrapping purified human _-chains within normal RBC via osmotic lysis and resealing. This human model allows for the systematic examination of the mechanisms underlying the _-chain mediated damage in the _ thalassemic RBC. Studies utilizing the model _ thalassemic RBC have demonstrated that the _-chains give rise to an iron and glutathione-dependent, self-amplifying and self-propagating oxidative reaction."							2020	Sep	23			Scott MD	"Book, Section"	10.5772/intechopen.90288		Marwa Zakaria and Tamer Hassan	Beta Thalassemia	IntechOpen	9.78184E+12

12		Red Blood Cell Metabolism in Patients with Propionic Acidemia	"Propionic acidemia (PA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with an estimated incidence of 1:100,000 live births in the general population. Due in part to an insufficient understanding of the disease�s pathophysiology, PA is often associated with complications, and in severe cases can cause coma and death. Despite its association with hematologic disorders, PA�s effect on red blood cell metabolism has not been described. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analyses were performed on RBCs from healthy controls (n = 10) and PKD patients (n = 3). PA was associated with a significant decrease in the steady state level of glycolytic products and the apparent activation of the PPP. The PA samples showed decreases in succinate and increases in the downstream dicarboxylates of the TCA cycle. BCAAs were lowered in the PA samples and C3 carnitine, a direct metabolite of propionic acid, was increased. Trends in the markers of oxidative stress including hypoxanthine, allantoate and spermidine were the opposite of those associated with elevated ROS burden. The alteration of short chain fatty acids, the accumulation of some medium chain and long chain fatty acids, and decreased markers of lipid peroxidation in the PA samples contrasted with previous research. Despite limitations from a small cohort, this study provides the first investigation of RBC metabolism in PA, paving the way for targeted investigations of the critical pathways found to be dysregulated in the context of this disease"		142		Separations	8	9	2021	Sep	3			"Roy MK, Cendali FI, Ooyama G, Gamboni F, Morton H, D�Alessandro A"		10.3390/separations8090142				MDPI	
13		"Quantitative analysis of the erythrocyte membrane proteins in polycythemia vera patients treated with hydroxycarbamide,"	"More than 90% of polycythemia vera (PV) patients have a mutation in the protein JAK2, which is closely associated with the erythrocyte membrane. With the comparison of 1-D gels of erythrocyte membranes obtained from PV patients treated with hydroxycarbamide and those of untreated controls we observed significant differences in the region of 40–55kDa. On the basis of the LC–MS/MS analysis of this region we report up-regulation of four protein disulfide isomerases, which was subsequently confirmed by targeted mass spectrometric analysis. In further studies it will be prudent to compare this in patients both treated and not treated with hydroxycarbamide."		43	53	"EuPA Open Proteomics,"	7		2015					"Kottahachchi D, Gooneratne L, Jayasekera A, Muth-Pawlak D, Moulder R, Imanishi SY, Ariyaratne A, Rokka A, Corthals GL,"		10.1016/j.euprot.2015.04.001	Erythrocyte membrane associated proteins; Polycythemia vera; JAK2 V617F; Quantitation; MS; Protein disulfide isomerase
