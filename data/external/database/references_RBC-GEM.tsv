27		Uridine-diphosphoglucose glucosyltransferase in human erythrocytes	The presence of glucosyltransferase activity in mature human erythrocytes and leukocytes has been established both by demonstration of UDP formation from UDPG, and by incorporation of [14C] glucose from UDP-[14C] glucose into glycogen. The erythrocyte and leukocyte enzymes have similar properties and both require glucose 6-P for activity. The enzyme activity per white cell is about 400 times that per red cell. The erythrocyte glucosyltransferase activities did not differ from that in the normal in two patients with hepatic glucosyltransferase deficiency and in other patients with a variety of carbohydrate abnormalities.		27	32	Clinica Chimica Acta	12	1	1965	July				Cornblath M, Steiner DF, Bryan P, King J	Journal, Article					10.1016/0009-8981(65)90104-X		red cell;erythrocyte	True
28	4285896	Nicotinamide nucleotides in the erythrocytes of patients suffering from pellagra.	1. The nicotinamide nucleotide concentrations in the erythrocytes of subjects suffering from pellagra (pellagrins) were not lower than those in normal subjects, but the ability of erythrocytes to synthesize these nucleotides in vitro was significantly lower in pellagrins. 2. The oral administration of 10g. of l-leucine daily for 5 days depressed the nicotinamide nucleotide-synthesizing ability of erythrocytes both in normal subjects and in pellagrins. This was not accompanied by changes in the nucleotide concentration in erythrocytes. 3. Quinolinic acid brought about a significant inhibition of the synthesis of nicotinamide nucleotides in vitro. Such inhibition was partially overcome by increasing the concentration of nicotinic acid in the medium.	eng	837	839	The Biochemical journal	96	3	1965	Sep		D000328;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D007930/Q000494;D009243/Q000096;D009711/Q000096;D010383/Q000378;D011725/Q000494	Adult;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Leucine/pharmacology;NAD/biosynthesis;Nucleotides/biosynthesis;Pellagra/metabolism;Pyridines/pharmacology	Raghuramulu N;Srikantia SG;Rao BS;Gopalan C	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

40	6018757	Concomitant alterations of sodium flux and membrane phospholipid metabolism in red blood cells: studies in hereditary spherocytosis.	"The role of membrane phosphatides in transport processes has been investigated in red cells from splenectomized patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS). Incorporation of inorganic (32)phosphate into the membrane phosphatides of HS red cells was approximately twice normal, coinciding with the nearly twofold increment in flux of sodium ions in the cells.A consistent, inordinate increase in specific activity of a chromatographic fraction containing phosphatidylserine provided the bulk of the over-all increase in labeling of HS red cell phosphatides. The specific activity of phosphatidic acid was increased but not consistently. Radioactivity of the ""acidic phosphatides"" (phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid fractions) decreased, in general, when the sodium flux was low, i.e., when the cells were suspended in media of low sodium content. When the cation flux was elevated (hypotonic media), there was a marked (ca. 35%) increase in the labeling of phosphatidylserine fractions. Normal red cells whose permeability to cations was increased by exposure to 0.5 N butanol also exhibited increased labeling of acidic phosphatides. Considerations of the stoichiometry of cation transport and phosphatide labeling make it unlikely that phospholipids act directly as carrier molecules for cations in red cell membranes. On the other hand, the involvement of these lipid substances in cation movements is substantiated by correlating several different states of sodium flux with the labeling of the phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine fractions."	eng	173	185	The Journal of clinical investigation	46	2	1967	Feb		D001692;D002462/Q000378;D002855;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007477;D009995;D010042/Q000494;D010714/Q000032;D010743/Q000378;D011868;D012964/Q000378;D013103/Q000097;D013103/Q000378	Biological Transport;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Chromatography, Thin Layer;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Ions;Osmosis;Ouabain/pharmacology;Phosphatidylethanolamines/analysis;Phospholipids/metabolism;Radioisotopes;Sodium/metabolism;Spherocytosis, Hereditary/blood;Spherocytosis, Hereditary/metabolism	Jacob HS;Karnovsky ML	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True

43	4383664	The uptake of amines by human erythrocytes in vitro.	1. Human erythrocytes incubated at 37 degrees C in Krebs bicarbonate solution at pH 7.5 took up 5-hydroxytryptamine, histamine and (-)-noradrenaline at slow rates which were proportional to the concentration of the amines in the medium at least up to 16 mug/ml., in accordance with a simple diffusion process.2. The initial velocity of uptake was greatest for 5-hydroxytryptamine, about 4 times less for histamine and about 20 times less for (-)-noradrenaline; (+)-noradrenaline was not taken up.3. Comparison of uptake measurements by bio-assay and by radioactivity indicated that, after 1 hr, about 10% of each amine taken up had been inactivated.4. At 2 degrees C the uptake of all three amines was greatly diminished. The presence of the antagonists cocaine, chlorpromazine, lysergic acid diethylamide, mepyramine and pronethalol (at 10(-6) or 10(-5) g/ml.) did not affect uptake of the amines.5. In the steady state the ratios of concentration of the amines between cells and medium were greater than could be accounted for by a Donnan distribution.6. Cells which had taken up amines lost most but not all of them into amine-free medium, at rates which were slower than the corresponding rates of uptake. It was concluded that the amines are partially bound in the cells, noradrenaline most and histamine least.7. The slow diffusion of amines into, and the small amounts retained by, erythrocytes indicate that they do not contribute significantly to the rapid termination of the pharmacological actions of these amines in vivo.	eng	405	418	The Journal of physiology	193	2	1967	Nov		D002247;D002746/Q000494;D003042/Q000494;D004912/Q000378;D004983/Q000494;D006632/Q000378;D006634/Q000494;D006801;D066298;D008238/Q000494;D009638/Q000378;D012701/Q000378	Carbon Isotopes;Chlorpromazine/pharmacology;Cocaine/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Ethanolamines/pharmacology;Histamine/metabolism;Histamine H1 Antagonists/pharmacology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Lysergic Acid Diethylamide/pharmacology;Norepinephrine/metabolism;Serotonin/metabolism	Born GV;Day M;Stockbridge A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

46	5651769	Concentrative accumulation of choline by human erythrocytes.	Influx and efflux of choline in human erythrocytes were studied using (14)C-choline. When incubated at 37 degrees C with physiological concentrations of choline erythrocytes concentrate choline; the steady-state ratio is 2.08 +/- 0.23 when the external choline is 2.5 microM and falls to 0.94 +/- 0.13 as the external concentration is raised to 50 microM. During the steady state the influx of choline is consistent with a carrier system with an apparent Michaelis constant of 30 x 10(-6) and a maximum flux of 1.1 micromoles per liter cells per min. For the influx into cells preequilibrated with a choline-free buffer the apparent Michaelis constant is about 6.5 x 10(-6)M and the maximum flux is 0.22 micromole per liter cells per min. At intracellular concentrations below 50 micromole per liter cells the efflux in the steady state approximates first order kinetics; however, it is not flux through a leak because it is inhibited by hemicholinium. Influx and efflux show a pronounced exchange flux phenomenon. The ability to concentrate choline is lost when external sodium is replaced by lithium or potassium. However, the uphill movement of choline is probably not coupled directly to the Na(+) electrochemical gradient.	eng	497	516	The Journal of general physiology	51	4	1968	Apr		D001693;D002247;D002794/Q000378;D004594;D004912/Q000378;D006400;D006801;D007700;D008433;D010042/Q000494;D012964/Q000378;D013696	Biological Transport, Active;Carbon Isotopes;Choline/metabolism;Electrophysiology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hematocrit;Humans;Kinetics;Mathematics;Ouabain/pharmacology;Sodium/metabolism;Temperature	Martin K	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

48	5666113	Enzymic properties of different types of human erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, with characterization of two new genetic variants.	"Enzymic properties have been compared in the following five genetic variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes: the two common variants with normal activity, A and B; the common variant associated with enzyme deficiency, A-; and two new rare variants, ""Ijebu-Ode"" and ""Ita-Bale.""The maximal velocity of the enzyme reaction (V(max)) increases steadily with pH over the entire range explored (from pH 5.5 to 9.5) for all enzyme variants when buffers are used that show no specific ion effects on enzyme activity. Small differences are found among the variants in the pH range 7.5-8.2, where A and B show a ""peak and trough,"" while A-, ""Ijebu-Ode,"" and ""Ita-Bale"" exhibit a plateau. When the effects of reagents that bind to sulphydryl groups are compared, iodoacetate, bromoacetate, and iodoacetamide are weak inhibitors, while N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and hydroxymercuribenzoate (HMB) are potent inhibitors. The last two reagents have differential inhibitory action on different variants; one of these, ""Ijebu-Ode,"" is strikingly resistant to HMB and totally resistant to NEM (up to 3 mmoles/liter). The enzyme inactivation as a function of temperature exhibits distinctive profiles for all variants examined. BOTH OF THE NEW VARIANTS DESCRIBED DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE NORMAL B TYPE IN SEVERAL RESPECTS: ""Ijebu-Ode"" in electrophoretic mobility, thermostability, dependence of V(max) on pH, and resistance to sulphydryl group reagents; ""Ita-Bale"" in electrophoretic mobility, Michaelis constant (K(m)) for glucose-6-phosphate, and dependence of V(max) on pH. When these data are compared with those available in the literature, both variants are different from all those previously described. The estimated frequencies of the corresponding genes in western Nigeria are between 0.0005 and 0.0025 for ""Ijebu-Ode"" and less than 0.0005 for ""Ita-Bale"". The A- variant, compared to A, has a distinctly higher K(m) for 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate and is more inhibited by very low concentrations of HMB. These are the first observed differences in kinetic properties between A and A-."	eng	1833	1842	The Journal of clinical investigation	47	8	1968	Aug		D055598;D002621;D004586;D004912/Q000201;D014644;D005954/Q000032;D006601;D006358;D006801;D006863;D008297;D008967;D013438	Chemical Phenomena;Chemistry;Electrophoresis;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Genetic Variation;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/analysis;Hexoses;Hot Temperature;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Male;Molecular Biology;Sulfhydryl Compounds	Luzzatto L;Afolayan A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

51	5240360	Glucose and glycogen metabolism in erythrocytes from normal and glycogen storage disease type III subjects.	Active glycogen metabolism has been demonstrated in both normal and glycogen-rich erythrocytes taken from patients with type III glycogen storage disease. Activity of all enzymes catalyzing the reactions required for the synthesis and degradation of glycogen have been demonstrated in the mature erythrocytes. Uniformly labeled glucose-(14)C is incorporated into glycogen in intact cells of both types during incubation. Replacement of the glucose-(14)C by unlabeled glucose in the medium resulted in a significant loss of radioactivity from cellular glycogen. In the absence of the substrate a progressive shortening of outer branches occurred during incubation of intact glucogen-rich cells. Using cells from patients with type III glycogen storage disease, which have sufficient glycogen content to be analyzed by beta-amylolysis, we demonstrated that the glucosyl units are first incorporated in the outer tiers, then transferred to the core where they tend to accumulate due to the absence of amylo-1,6-glucosidase. The glycogen-rich cells have a more rapid rate of glucose utilization upon incubation which is not reflected by a higher lactate production. The increased rate of glucose utilization did not result from an increased rate of glucose incorporation into glycogen in affected cells. The rate of (14)CO(2) production from glucose-1-(14)C during incubation was not significantly different in the two types of cells unless methylene blue was added as an electron acceptor, in which case the glycogen-rich cells oxidized glucose to CO(2) more rapidly.	eng	1343	1348	The Journal of clinical investigation	47	6	1968	Jun		D001786/Q000378;D002247;D004912/Q000032;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D005959/Q000378;D006003/Q000378;D006008;D006801;D007773/Q000032;D013213/Q000378;D014501	Blood Glucose/metabolism;Carbon Isotopes;Erythrocytes/analysis;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucosidases/metabolism;Glycogen/metabolism;Glycogen Storage Disease;Humans;Lactates/analysis;Starch/metabolism;Uranium	Moses SW;Chayoth R;Levin S;Lazarovitz E;Rubinstein D	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

58	4388010	Studies in the enzymology of glutathione metabolism in human erythrocytes.	Spectrophotometric assay methods are described for glutathione synthetase, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase of erythrocytes. The contents of these enzymes in normal human erythrocytes are reported. Erythrocyte glutathione synthetase is inhibited by ADP; this inhibition is competitive with respect to ATP. gamma-Glutamylcysteine synthetase is subject to feedback inhibition by GSH, and is also inhibited by NADH, and to a lesser extent by NAD(+) and NADPH. This enzyme is irreversibly inactivated by cysteamine.	eng	309	315	The Biochemical journal	111	3	1969	Feb		D000217/Q000032;D000227/Q000494;D000255/Q000378;D003543/Q000494;D003864;D004912/Q000201;D005246;D005978/Q000378;D006801;D008025/Q000032;D008025/Q000037;D008025/Q000378;D009243/Q000494;D009249/Q000494;D013053	Acyltransferases/analysis;Adenine Nucleotides/pharmacology;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Cysteamine/pharmacology;Depression, Chemical;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Feedback;Glutathione/metabolism;Humans;Ligases/analysis;Ligases/antagonists & inhibitors;Ligases/metabolism;NAD/pharmacology;NADP/pharmacology;Spectrophotometry	Jackson RC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

62	5773084	Mannose metabolism in the human erythrocyte.	The metabolism of mannose by human erythrocytes has been investigated. Phosphorylation of mannose is achieved by an enzyme with electrophoretic mobility on starch gel indistinguishable from the glucose-phosphorylating enzyme. Mannose phosphorylation is competitively inhibited by glucose; glucose phosphorylation is competitively inhibited by mannose. The K(i) values of inhibition are similar to the K(m) values for uninhibited phosphorylation. The normal average mannose-phosphorylating activity was found to be 0.69 U/g of Hb; the normal average glucose-phosphorylating activity was found to be 0.64 U/g of Hb. The ratio of mannose-phosphorylating activity to glucose-phosphorylating activity of a hemolysate prepared from the red cells of a subject with hexokinase deficiency was found to be within the normal range.Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) activity of the red cells was found to average 0.064 U/g of Hb at its pH optimum of 5.9 with a mannose-6-phosphate (Man-6-P) concentration of 5 mmoles/liter. The enzyme activity in young cells was greater than activity in old cells. When human erythrocytes are incubated with mannose rapid accumulation of Man-6-P occurs, a finding indicating that PMI and not hexokinase is the limiting enzyme in the over-all conversion of mannose to fructose by the red cell. The ratio of mannose utilization to glucose utilization in hexokinase-deficient cells was greater than normal, as has been reported previously. These cells were found to have greatly increased PMI activity, presumably because of their young mean cell age. Consequently, Man-6-P accumulated only approximately one-third as rapidly as normal in hexokinase-deficient cells incubated with mannose. It is believed that the more rapid utilization of mannose relative to glucose by intact hexokinase-deficient cells may be explained on the basis of the regulatory effect of the PMI reaction on the rate of mannose utilization.	eng	461	466	The Journal of clinical investigation	48	3	1969	Mar		D001786/Q000378;D004586;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006593/Q000378;D006600/Q000096;D006801;D007535/Q000378;D008358/Q000097	Blood Glucose/metabolism;Electrophoresis;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hexokinase/metabolism;Hexosephosphates/biosynthesis;Humans;Isomerases/metabolism;Mannose/blood	Beutler E;Teeple L	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

77	5288760	N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyltransferase in human serum and erythrocyte membranes.	This study demonstrates the presence of an N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyltransferase in human serum and in erythrocyte membranes. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine from UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine to a mucin receptor and 2'-fucosyllactose that have blood group H activity and may be responsible, therefore, for blood group A antigenicity. It was present in the serum of individuals with blood group A or AB but was absent from those with blood group B or O. The activity measured in the erythrocyte membrane was low and did not show clear-cut separation among donors of different blood groups. The specificity of this enzyme in serum was suggested by the ability of 2'-fucosyllactose to act as an acceptor, as well as desialyzed porcine submaxillary mucin, while lactose and desialized fetuin failed to accept N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. The catalytic properties of the N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyltransferase from serum and from erythrocyte membranes were similar.	eng	1753	1756	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	68	8	1971	Aug		D000017;D000217/Q000097;D000255/Q000494;D001345;D001789;D002247;D002462/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D005688/Q000378;D006801;D008345/Q000494	ABO Blood-Group System;Acyltransferases/blood;Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology;Autoradiography;Blood Group Antigens;Carbon Isotopes;Cell Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Galactosamine/metabolism;Humans;Manganese/pharmacology	Kim YS;Perdomo J;Bella A;Nordberg J	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

93	5054461	Glycosyltransferases in human blood.I. Galactosyltransferase in human serum and erythrocyte membranes.	Human serum and hemoglobin-free erythrocyte membranes were found to contain a galactosyltransferase which catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to specific large and small molecular weight acceptors. The requirements for enzyme activity were found to be similar for the enzymes from both sources. However, the membrane-bound enzyme depended on a detergent for maximal activity. Mn(++) was an absolute requirement for transfer and uridine nucleoside phosphates were inhibitors. The most effective acceptor for galactose was a glycoprotein containing N-acetylglucosamine residues in the terminal position of its oligosaccharide side chains, N-acetylglucosamine was also an acceptor. While the presence of alpha-lactalbumin in the incubation medium resulted in a significant decrease in the transfer of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine, glucose, which was not an acceptor for galactose in the absence of alpha-lactalbumin, became an excellent acceptor. The serum enzyme catalyzed the transfer of 54 nmoles of galactose per milliliter of serum per hour and its apparent K(m) for UDP-galactose was 7.5 x 10(-6)M. The membrane enzyme had a similar apparent K(m). Using a quantitative assay system the enzyme was found to be present in all individuals studied, regardless of their blood type, secretor status, or sex.	eng	2024	2032	The Journal of clinical investigation	51	8	1972	Aug		D000017;D000418/Q000494;D003902/Q000494;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D005690;D005944/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D006023/Q000378;D006602/Q000097;D006801;D008297;D008345/Q000378;D008566/Q000201;D008722;D009077;D014500/Q000494	ABO Blood-Group System;Albumins/pharmacology;Detergents/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Galactose;Glucosamine/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Glycoproteins/metabolism;Hexosyltransferases/blood;Humans;Male;Manganese/metabolism;Membranes/enzymology;Methods;Mucins;Uracil Nucleotides/pharmacology	Kim YS;Perdomo J;Whitehead JS	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

95	5041270	Quantitative analysis of uptake of free fatty acid by mammalian cells: lauric acid and human erythrocytes.	Quantitative aspects of the binding of free fatty acid to human erythrocytes were studied by measuring the distribution of various amounts of [1-(14)C]lauric acid between washed human erythrocytes and defatted human plasma albumin. Incubations were done at 37 degrees C in an isotonic phosphate-buffered salt solution. Laurate uptake approached a steady state value within 1 hr of incubation over the range of laurate-albumin molar ratios that were tested. Uptake was due primarily to a transfer of laurate from albumin to the cell, not to incorporation of the intact laurate-albumin complex. The fatty acid binding sites of the erythrocyte are located predominantly on or within the cell membrane. The binding model which best fitted the laurate uptake data consisted of two classes of erythrocyte binding sites. This model contains a small number of sites, 2.0 x 10(-13) moles/10(6) cells, that have an average apparent association constant of 1.8 x 10(6) m(-1) for laurate. Thus, the average strength of these sites is of the same order of magnitude as the stronger laurate binding sites of albumin. The binding model also contains a relatively large number of weaker fatty acid binding sites, 1.3 x 10(-11) moles/10(6) cells, that have an average apparent association constant of 1.3 x 10(4) m(-1) for laurate. These sites are too weak to bind appreciable amounts of laurate unless the fatty acid-albumin molar ratio is elevated.	eng	445	451	Journal of lipid research	13	4	1972	Jul		D001665;D002247;D002462/Q000378;D003201;D004912/Q000378;D005230/Q000378;D006801;D008433;D011485;D012709;D012711;D013997	Binding Sites;Carbon Isotopes;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Computers;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/metabolism;Humans;Mathematics;Protein Binding;Serum Albumin;Serum Albumin, Radio-Iodinated;Time Factors	Spector AA;Ashbrook JD;Santos EC;Fletcher JE	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

97	5024037	Inosinic acid dehydrogenase activity in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.	Inosinic acid dehydrogenase was evaluated in normal subjects and in patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. A significant difference in activity was found between erythrocytes derived from normal controls (1.21+/-0.47 pmoles/hr per mg protein) and from 15 patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (6.72+/-6.23 pmoles/hr per mg protein). However, no difference in activity was demonstrable in muscle or leukocytes derived from normal and Lesch-Nyhan patients. The increased activity of inosinic acid dehydrogenase in erythrocytes from patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is due to stabilization of the enzyme in vivo as well as the absence of an inhibitor which is present in erythrocytes from normal subjects.	eng	1398	1404	The Journal of clinical investigation	51	6	1972	Jun		D000704;D001264;D002247;D004912/Q000201;D006150/Q000096;D006801;D007292;D008607;D007926/Q000097;D007926/Q000201;D009711/Q000096;D010088/Q000097;D010088/Q000378;D011686/Q000201;D012652;D014166/Q000097	Analysis of Variance;Athetosis;Carbon Isotopes;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Guanine Nucleotides/biosynthesis;Humans;Inosine Nucleotides;Intellectual Disability;Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome/blood;Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome/enzymology;Nucleotides/biosynthesis;Oxidoreductases/blood;Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/enzymology;Self Mutilation;Transferases/blood	Pehlke DM;McDonald JA;Holmes EW;Kelley WN	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
98	4405572	Isolation and characterization of 17 -hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes.	1. The 17beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase was solubilized during haemolysis of erythrocytes and was isolated from the membrane-free haemolysate. Membrane preparations isolated in different ways did not contain 17beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase activity. The 17beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase activity in the haemolysate was concentrated by repeated ammonium sulphate precipitation and gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. The 17beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase activity of the purified preparation per unit weight of protein was 350-3000 times higher than the activity of the crude erythrocyte haemolysate. The 20alpha-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase activity was lost during this purification procedure. 2. The 17beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase was NADP-dependent and had a pH optimum for conversion of testosterone between 8.5 and 10. For the molecular weight of the enzyme a value of 64000 was calculated from Sephadex chromatography results. 3. p-Chloromercuribenzoate inhibited the enzymic activity. The oxidative activity of the enzyme for the 17beta-hydroxyl group was only partly inhibited when a large excess of 17-oxo steroids was added. The catalysing activity of the enzyme was influenced by the NADP(+)/NADPH ratio. The oxidation of the 17beta-hydroxyl group in the presence of NADP(+) proceeded faster than the reduction of the 17-oxo group with NADPH. When both reduced and oxidized cofactors were present the oxidation of the 17beta-hydroxyl group was inhibited to a considerable extent. 4. The enzyme had a broad substrate specificity and not only catalysed the conversion of androstanes with a 17beta-hydroxyl group, or 17-oxo group, but also the conversion oestradiolleft arrow over right arrowoestrone. In addition the steroid conjugates dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and oestrone sulphate were also converted. There were no indications that more than one 17beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase was present in the partially purified preparation.	eng	649	659	The Biochemical journal	127	4	1972	May		D000645;D002247;D002729;D002845;D002850;D003687;D004912/Q000201;D004958;D004970;D006461;D006801;D006863;D006913/Q000302;D008970;D009249;D011134;D013739;D014316	Ammonium Sulfate;Carbon Isotopes;Chloromercuribenzoates;Chromatography;Chromatography, Gel;Dehydroepiandrosterone;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Estradiol;Estrone;Hemolysis;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/isolation & purification;Molecular Weight;NADP;Polysaccharides;Testosterone;Tritium	Mulder E;Lamers-Stahlhofen GJ;van der Molen HJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

104	4403564	Decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) by erythrocytes: a reaction promoted by methemoglobin and other ferriheme proteins.	The decarboxylation of DOPA by erythrocyte hemolysates differs from DOPA decarboxylation catalyzed by aromatic aminoacid decarboxylases that contain vitamin B(6) in several significant respects. The ability of erythrocyte hemolysates to decarboxylate DOPA is associated with interaction between DOPA and methemoglobin; the ferriheme protein is reduced and DOPA is decarboxylated, probably after oxidation to a quinone intermediate. An analogous reaction takes place between DOPA and other ferriheme proteins, such as metmyoglobin and cytochrome c. This phenomenon may be of significance in relation to the side effects observed in patients with Parkinson's disease who are treated with very large doses of DOPA.	eng	2505	2508	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	69	9	1972	Sep		D000818;D001205;D002247;D055598;D002621;D002854;D003580;D003605;D003653;D004295/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006454;D006801;D007668/Q000201;D007668/Q000378;D008099/Q000378;D008706;D051379;D009211;D010084;D010544;D013053;D013237	Animals;Ascorbic Acid;Carbon Isotopes;Chemical Phenomena;Chemistry;Chromatography, Paper;Cytochromes;D-Amino-Acid Oxidase;Decarboxylation;Dihydroxyphenylalanine/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemoglobins;Humans;Kidney/enzymology;Kidney/metabolism;Liver/metabolism;Methemoglobin;Mice;Myoglobin;Oxidation-Reduction;Peroxidases;Spectrophotometry;Stereoisomerism	Tate SS;Orlando J;Meister A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

109	4365376	NAD(P) glycohydrolase deficiency in human erythrocytes and alteration of cytosol NADH-methemoglobin diaphorase by membrane NAD-glycohydrolase activity.	Erythrocytic NADH methemoglobin diaphorase acquires NADH-dichlorophenolindophenol diaphorase activity when enzyme-associated NAD is removed. This transformation is reversible and can be mediated by membrane NAD glycohydrolase (EC 3.2.2.5) in hemolysates as well as in intact cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. It is abolished either in NADH methemoglobin diaphorase deficiency or in NAD(P) glycohydrolase (EC 3.2.2.6) deficiency which is common in Afro-American but not in European-American adults. Activities of erythrocytic NADP glycohydrolase and NAD glycohydrolase appear to depend on a single membrane enzyme.	eng	2406	2410	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	70	8	1973	Aug		D002462/Q000201;D003600/Q000201;D008058/Q000097;D004591;D004789;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008706;D009699/Q000097;D009243/Q000097	Cell Membrane/enzymology;Cytosol/enzymology;Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase/blood;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Methemoglobin;N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/blood;NAD/blood	Frischer H;Nelson R;Noyes C;Carson PE;Bowman JE;Rieckmann KH;Ajmar F	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;Erythro;erythrocyte;erythro	True

111	4271735	Dependence on calcium concentration and stoichiometry of the calcium pump in human red cells.	1. In resealed human red cells loaded with Ca-EGTA buffer solutions it was found that the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration for half saturation of the Ca transport system (which pumps Ca out of the cell) is equal to or smaller than 4 x 10(-6)M and thus closely agrees with the dissociation constant of the Ca + Mg activated membrane ATPase.2. The maximal rate of Ca transport from resealed cells to medium was found to be 0.148 +/- 0.009 mumole/ml. cells.min at 28 degrees C.3. The rate of Ca transport was unaffected by a variation of the extracellular Ca(2+) concentration from 3.10(-7) to 5.10(-3)M.4. Evidence is presented making it probable that the stoichiometric relation between Ca transported and ATP hydrolysed is 1:1 rather than 2:1.5. As the Ca transport is quite rapid even at half saturation and the passive leak for Ca negligible in intact cells it can be predicted that the steady-state cellular Ca(2+) concentration must be low, most probably less than 10(-6) mumole/ml. cells. Transport from cells containing 5.10(-7) mumole/ml. into blood plasma is thermodynamically compatible with the normal plasma Ca(2+) concentration and the normal cellular ATP, ADP and P(i) content.6. Treatment with the mercurial PCMBS in the cold for 15 hr allows to load red cells with 1 mumole Ca/ml. cells without destroying their ability to transport Ca after removal of the mercurial.7. It is shown that at high cellular Ca concentrations (0.1-3 mumole/ml. cells) about 50% of the total is free Ca(2+) on account of binding mainly to dialysable cell constituents.	eng	551	569	The Journal of physiology	235	2	1973	Dec		D000251/Q000378;D001557;D001693;D002118/Q000097;D002118/Q000378;D002462/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D008433;D008628/Q000378;D009942;D013696;D013816	Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism;Benzenesulfonates;Biological Transport, Active;Calcium/blood;Calcium/metabolism;Cell Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Mathematics;Mercury/metabolism;Organometallic Compounds;Temperature;Thermodynamics	Schatzmann HJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True

130	4825223	The reduction of glyceraldehyde by human erythrocytes. L-hexonate dehydrogenase activity.	Incubation of red cell suspensions with D-glyceraldehyde resulted in disappearance of glyceraldehyde and appearance of glycerol. Concomitantly, there was an increase of CO(2) formation from glucose. This indicated that the reduction of glyceraldehyde to glycerol occurred through a NADPH-linked system. Studies in hemolysates revealed the presence of an enzyme with the capacity to catalyze the reduction of glyceraldehyde to glycerol by NADPH. This enzyme was partially purified by DEAE chromatography. The elution pattern of the enzyme and its kinetic characteristics indicated that the enzyme was L-hexonate dehydrogenase (L-gulonate: NADP oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.19), not aldose reductase (Alditol: NADP oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.21), which had previously been thought present in erythrocytes. The reduction of glyceraldehyde to glycerol is one of a number of pathways for the metabolism of glyceraldehyde that have been found in red cells and/or other mammalian tissues.	eng	1258	1264	The Journal of clinical investigation	53	5	1974	May		D000429/Q000032;D000429/Q000378;D002245/Q000096;D002848;D002852;D004912/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D005985/Q000378;D005990/Q000378;D006801;D006863	Alcohol Oxidoreductases/analysis;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Carbon Dioxide/biosynthesis;Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Glyceraldehyde/metabolism;Glycerol/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration	Beutler E;Guinto E	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

The levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and ATP decrease during the incubation with xylitol. This decrease is not a specific effect of xylitol, but depends on the amount of C-atoms taken up. This could be shown in control experiments with fructose and glucose as substrates given separated or in combination with xylitol. The highest uptake of C-atoms has been observed with glucose plus xylitol as substrate. 3. 99% of the metabolized xylitol was recovered in the products lactate, Co2 and D-xylulose. 4. There was no measurable oxalate production from xylitol.	ger	268	271	Zeitschrift fur Ernahrungswissenschaft	14	4	1975	Dec		D000255/Q000378;D002245/Q000378;D004163/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007773/Q000378;D013997;D014993/Q000097;D014993/Q000378;D014996/Q000378	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Carbon Dioxide/metabolism;Diphosphoglyceric Acids/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Lactates/metabolism;Time Factors;Xylitol/blood;Xylitol/metabolism;Xylulose/metabolism	Quadflieg KH;Brand K	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
133	163969	17 Beta-estradiol transport and metabolism in human red blood cells.	Attempts to measure the function of red blood cells as steroid metabolizing tissue showed that the membrane plays an important role. Of the 17beta-estradiol associated with red cells, 2/3 was bound to the membrane while 1/3 was in the soluble fraction. The binding appears to be nonspecific and linearly related to the amount incubated. Binding was more extensive at 2 C than at 26 C. Successive washes of red cells with isotonic sodium chloride solution increased their ability to bind 17beta-estradiol. Red cells incubated in isotonic salt media removed 85.1 plus or minus 3.2% (SD) of the total estrogens present and this value remained within narrow limits for incubation times as short as 15 s and as long as 19 h at 37 C. When incubated in homologous plasma, only 8-12% of estrogens in the media became associated with cells. The eight-fold difference in cell binding between salt solution and plasma can be attributed to competition with plasm aproteins. Presence of plasma proteins diminished but does not prevent activity of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase of red cells. Cells produce four times more estrone when incubated in saline media than when incubated in their own plasma. The enzyme is in the soluble portion of the cells and the steroids have to traverse the membrane in both directions. In the transfer of estrogens from plasma of cytoplasm, the membrane needs to be considered as a separate compartment.	eng	177	185	The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism	40	2	1975	Feb		D001798/Q000378;D002462/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D004958/Q000378;D004970/Q000096;D006801;D006913/Q000378;D011485;D011956;D012965/Q000494;D013696;D013997	Blood Proteins/metabolism;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Estradiol/metabolism;Estrone/biosynthesis;Humans;Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism;Protein Binding;Receptors, Cell Surface;Sodium Chloride/pharmacology;Temperature;Time Factors	Jacobsohn GM;Siegel ET;Jacobsohn MK	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell;Red cell	True
134	1201198	Four new pyruvate kinase (PK) variants and a classical PK deficiency.	Four new red-cell pyruvate kinase (PK) variants are presented along with one case of so-called classical type PK deficiency. PK 'Tokyo II' had a low activity, Km (PEP) and Vmax, but a normal urea stability and only slight deviation from normal in neutralization tests by antiserum. It had a normal nucleotide specificity, abnormal electrophoretic mobility (fast moving) and the variant was associated with a mild hemolytic anaemia. PK 'Maebashi' had a low activity, high Km (PEP), low Vmax, urea instability, decreased reactivity to antiserum, normal electrophoretic mobility, normal nucleotide specificity and was associated with a moderate haemolytic anaemia. PK 'Tsukiji' had low activity, high Km (PEP), markedly high Vmax, urea instability, decreased reactivity to antiserum, abnormal electrophoretic mobility (fast moving) and grossly abnormal nucleotide specificity especially abnormal behaviour to ADP. The haemolytic process in this case was moderate to severe. PK 'Ube' was electrophoretically abnormal (fast moving) but otherwise had normal characteristics and the propositus was healthy and not anaemic. PK 'Ube' was found by electrophoretic screening for genetic PK polymorphism. In the classical type PK deficiency, the usual red-cell PK (PK-R1 and PK-R2) was not demonstrable by electrophoresis but instead M2-type PK was present, presumably by compensatory process. Kinetic studies confirmed that the patient's red-cell PK consisted of M2-type PK. This patient had a severe haemolytic anaemia.	eng	157	169	British journal of haematology	29	1	1975	Jan		D000328;D000743/Q000235;D002648;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D014644;D006801;D008297;D009500;D009712/Q000032;D011770/Q000032;D011770/Q000172	Adult;Anemia, Hemolytic/genetics;Child;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Genetic Variation;Humans;Male;Neutralization Tests;Nucleotides, Cyclic/analysis;Pyruvate Kinase/analysis;Pyruvate Kinase/deficiency	Miwa S;Nakashima K;Ariyoshi K;Shinohara K;Oda E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte	True

136	1146729	Distribution of tocopherols in human plasma and red blood cells.	The content of various tocopherols was determined in normal plasma and red blood cells. alpha-Tocopherol concentrations ranged form 6.6 to 15.0 (mean 9.6) mug/ml in plasma and from 0.9 to 1.8 (mean 1.4) mug/ml in red blood cells. gamma-Tocopherol ranged from 0.7 to 2.7 (mean 1.6) mug/ml in plasma and fron 0.1 to 0.4 (mean 0.24) mug/ml in red blood cells. Only a minute amount (smaller than 0.3 mug/ml) of each of alpha-tocotrienol, beta-tocopherol, gamma-tocotrienol and delta-tocopherol was found in plasma but none in red blood cells. No delta-tochotrienol was detected in either plasma or red blood cells. Of the total tocopherols, alpha form accounted 83 per cent in plasma and 87 per cent in red blood cells and gamma from represented 13 per cent in each system. The recovery of added 14-C-alpha-tocopherol averaged 87 per cent and 69 per cent, respectively, for plasma and red blood cells. All alpha-tocopherol in the red blood cells was found to be localized in the membrane fraction.	eng	756	760	The American journal of clinical nutrition	28	7	1975	Jul		D002250;D004041/Q000032;D004912/Q000378;D005069;D006801;D008566/Q000378;D009821/Q000032;D014481;D014810/Q000032;D014810/Q000097	Carbon Radioisotopes;Dietary Fats/analysis;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Evaluation Studies as Topic;Humans;Membranes/metabolism;Oils/analysis;United States;Vitamin E/analysis;Vitamin E/blood	Chow CK	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
137	807573	Purification and properties of human erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase.	Glutathione peroxidase has been purified to homogeneity from human erythrocytes. The purification steps involved ammonium sulfate precipitation of hemolysate, CM-cellulose (CM-52), DEAE-cellulose (DE52), Sephadex G-200, and DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography. In the last step, i.e. DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography, the enzyme was eluted in a major peak and tailing fraction. The major peak was found to be homogeneous on polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis and disignated as glutathione peroxidase A (GSH-Px A). The tail fraction, however, separated into two protein bands on polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis. One of the bands corresponded to GSH-Px A while the other band was slower moving and was designated as GSH-Px B. GSH-Px A and GSH-Px B had specific activity of 103 and 4 enzyme units per mg of protein, respectively. Antibodies raised against the homogeneous GSH-Px A have been found to cross-react with GSH-Px B. Both, GSH-Px A and B are selenoproteins. GSH-Px A has been found to contain 3.5 g atoms of selenium per mol of protein. Selenium content of GSH-Px B, however, could not be determined accurately due to insufficient material. The molecular weight of GSH-Px A as determined by the sedimentation equilibrium method is 95,000 plus or minus 3,000. On urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis GSH-Px A and B dissociate into single subunits. The molecular weight of the subunits of GSH-Px A is 23,000 and that of GSH-Px B is 47,000. Thus, it appears that GSH-Px A is a tetramer. Our results suggest that GSH-Px B is probably an altered form of the major component, GSH-Px A, or its precursor. The properties of GSH-Px A have been studied. The isoelectric pH was found to be 4.9 and the optimum pH for enzyme activity was 8.5. The energy of activation was 8.2 kcal. The Km of the enzyme for GSH was 4.1 mM while the Km for t-butyl hydroperoxide was 52 mu-M. The effect of sulfhydryl reagents and the metal ions on the enzyme was also studied.	eng	5144	5149	The Journal of biological chemistry	250	13	1975	Jul	10	D000818;D001151/Q000494;D002413/Q000494;D002846;D002848;D002850;D004589;D004912/Q000201;D005033/Q000494;D005979/Q000097;D005979/Q000302;D006801;D006902/Q000494;D005779;D007461/Q000494;D007700;D008970;D010544/Q000097;D011817/Q000276;D012643/Q000032;D012967	Animals;Arsenic/pharmacology;Cations, Divalent/pharmacology;Chromatography, Affinity;Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose;Chromatography, Gel;Electrophoresis, Disc;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology;Glutathione Peroxidase/blood;Glutathione Peroxidase/isolation & purification;Humans;Hydroxymercuribenzoates/pharmacology;Immunodiffusion;Iodoacetates/pharmacology;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;Peroxidases/blood;Rabbits/immunology;Selenium/analysis;Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate	Awasthi YC;Beutler E;Srivastava SK	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
138		Adenylosuccinate lyase from human erythrocytes	1. Adenylosuccinate lyase (S-AMP lyase) (E.C. 4.3.2.2) has been purified 10,000-fold from human erythrocyte lysates. 2. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of S-AMP to AMP and fumarate, and the conversion of JV-(5-amino-l-ribosyl-4-imidazole carbonyl)-l-aspartic acid 5'-phosphate (S-AICA ribonucleotide) to 5-amino-l-ribosyl-4-imidazole carboxamide 5'-phosphate (AICA ribonucleotide) and fumarate. 3. The apparent Kms for S-AMP and S-AICA ribonucleotide were 2.3 _M and 3.5 _M respectively, in tricine buffer (pH 7.8). 4. AMP, AICA ribonucleotide and6-N succinoadenine were strong competitive inhibitors, fumarate was a comparatively weak non-competitive inhibitor, and orthophosphate was a weak competitive inhibitor.		497	503	International Journal of Biochemistry	6	7	1975	July				Barnes BL, Bishop SH	Journal, Article					10.1016/0020-711X(75)90030-0		erythrocyte	True

141	236766	Cholesterol ester hydrolase in human red blood cells.	1. Cholesterol ester hydrolytic activity (sterol-ester hydrolase EC 3.1.1.13) was detected in human red blood cells. Enzyme activity appeared confined to the cell membrane and was most marked in washed preparations of red cell ghosts. 2. Hydrolytic activity was stimulated by the anti-oxidants D-alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene. Marked inhibition was produced by erythrocyte hemolysate, sodium taurocholate, and Triton X-100. 3. Optimal pH for the reaction was 5.4--5.7. 4. Because red cell cholesterol is all unesterified, it is speculated that the hydrolase serves to maintain the erythrocyte membrane free of esterified cholesterol.	eng	138	145	Biochimica et biophysica acta	384	1	1975	Mar	28	D002084/Q000494;D002462/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D004950/Q000097;D006461;D006801;D006863;D011092/Q000494;D002787/Q000097;D013656/Q000494;D014810/Q000494	Butylated Hydroxytoluene/pharmacology;Cell Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Esterases/blood;Hemolysis;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology;Sterol Esterase/blood;Taurocholic Acid/pharmacology;Vitamin E/pharmacology	Poon RW;Simon JB	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
142	170192	Red cell uridine monophosphate kinase polymorphism in Japanese.	Samples from 635 unrelated Japanese blood doners in Tokyo were examined for their red cell uridine monophosphate kinase phenotypes using starch gel electrophoresis. Three phenotypes were found: UMPK1 (570, 89.76%), UMPK 2--1 (63, 9.92%) and UMPK 2 (2, 0.32%). The corresponding gene frequency for UMPK1 was 0.9472 and for UMPK2 was 0.0528. The UMPK2 frequency in the present study was slightly higher than the previously reported value for Caucasians in the United States, but the difference is not statistically significant. A study of 15 twin pairs and their parents was in agreement with the hypothesis of autosomal codominant inheritance for UMPK.	eng	255	257	Humangenetik	29	3	1975	Sep	23	D004912/Q000201;D005260;D005787;D005799;D006801;D007564;D010641;D010770/Q000097;D011110;D011247;D014430;D014541/Q000097	Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Gene Frequency;Genes, Dominant;Humans;Japan;Phenotype;Phosphotransferases/blood;Polymorphism, Genetic;Pregnancy;Twins, Monozygotic;Uridine Kinase/blood	Harada S;Ito M;Misawa S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell;Red cell	True
143	826280	Production of 1,2-diacylglycerol in human erythrocyte membranes exposed to low concentrations of calcium ions.	A specific increase in the membrane content of 1,2-diacylglycerol occurred when erythrocytes were lysed at 20 degrees C in media which did not inclued a chelator of Ca2+ and also when Ca2+ was added to haemoglobin-free erythrocyte ghosts which had been prepared in the presence of ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). The maximum increase was about 20-fold. The production of 1,2-diacylglycerol appeared to be caused by an endogenous membrane-bound phospholipase C which was half-maximally activated at less than 1 muM Ca2+ and which had access to only about 0.6-0.8% of the cells' glycerolipids. This activity was optimal at pH 7.0-7.2 in the presence of 0.1 mM Ca2+; under these conditions diacylglycerol production was complete within 5-10 min. Enzyme activity was markedly decreased at low temperatures, and was abolished by heating at 100 degrees C for 1 min.	eng	824	830	Biochimica et biophysica acta	455	3	1976	Dec	14	D002118/Q000494;D004075/Q000096;D004075/Q000097;D004533/Q000494;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005989/Q000097;D006801;D007700;D008563/Q000097;D010713/Q000097	Calcium/pharmacology;Diglycerides/biosynthesis;Diglycerides/blood;Egtazic Acid/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycerides/blood;Humans;Kinetics;Membrane Lipids/blood;Phosphatidylcholines/blood	Allan D;Michell RH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
144	180018	Human erythrocyte pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate kinase. Partial purification and properties of two allelic gene products.	Human pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate kinase is a polymorphic enzyme having two allelic gene products, UMPK 1 and UMPK 2, in several populations. A procedure is described for the partial purification of this enzyme from human red blood cells resulting in a 1500-fold purification of the enzyme for UMPK 1 and 583-fold for UMPK 2. The purified enzyme preparation catalyzed the phosphorylation of UMP, CMP, and dCMP, and used ATP as the preferred phosphate donor. The heavy metals, mercury, and copper, were found to be strong inhibitors of pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate kinase activity. EDTA was found to protect the enzyme from inactivation by the heavy metals, and 2-mercaptoethanol stabilized the enzyme during purification. UMPK 1 and UMPK 2 were found to have similar kinetic properties; however, UMPK 2 had a slower electrophoretic mobility and greater thermolability than UMPK 1.	eng	4179	4183	The Journal of biological chemistry	251	14	1976	Jul	25	D000483;D002413;D004355;D004912/Q000201;D006358;D006801;D007527/Q000097;D007700;D010770/Q000097;D010770/Q000302;D011110;D013329	Alleles;Cations, Divalent;Drug Stability;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Hot Temperature;Humans;Isoenzymes/blood;Kinetics;Phosphotransferases/blood;Phosphotransferases/isolation & purification;Polymorphism, Genetic;Structure-Activity Relationship	Teng YS;Chen SH;Scott CR	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
145	178178	Red cell uridine monophosphate kinase: effects of red cell aging on the activity of two UMPK gene products.	We have previously reported that uridine monophosphate kinase (UMPK) is genetically polymorphic in man, and that the UMPK2 gene product has less activity than that of UMPK1 when measured in normal red cells. In this paper we present evidence that the activity of UMPK, like that of many other enzymes, declines during red cell aging, and that the lower activity of UMPK 2, as compared with UMPK 1, is best explained by its more rapid catabolism.	eng	138	142	American journal of human genetics	28	2	1976	Mar		D004905;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D005796;D006801;D008297;D010641;D010770/Q000097;D011110;D014541/Q000097	Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Genes;Humans;Male;Phenotype;Phosphotransferases/blood;Polymorphism, Genetic;Uridine Kinase/blood	Teng Y;Chen S;Giblett ER	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell;Red cell	True

147	821476	Production of 1,2-diacylglycerol and phosphatidate in human erythrocytes treated with calcium ions and ionophore A23187.	1. When the ionophore A23187 and Ca2+ were added to normal human erythrocytes, the incorporation of 32P into phosphatidate was enhanced within 1 min, but there was only slight labelling of other phospholipids. 2. Labelling of phosphatidate in these cells did not continue to increase after about 20min at 37 degrees C; by this time, radioactivity in phosphatidate was about ten times higher inionophore A23187-treated cells than in controls. A net synthesis of phosphatidate was measured in response to the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration; the content of this phospholipid in the cell was increased by approximately 50%. 3. In the presence of 2.5 mM-Ca2+ a maximum effect was seen with about 0.5 mug of ionophore/ml. 4. The concentration of Ca2+ giving half-maximal labelling of phosphatidate in the presence of 10 mug of ionophore A23187/ml was about 10 muM. 5. A rapid decrease of ATP content in the cell occurred in ionophore-treated cells. 6. Labelling of phosphatidate appeared to be secondary to the production of 1,2-diacylglycerol in the cells; accumulation of 1,2-diacylglycerol was only seen after about 15 min. After 60 min, the 1,2-diacylglycerol content of the cells was five to seven times that of untreated control cells. 7. The change in the shape of erythrocytes treated with Ca2+ and ionophore appeared to be related to accumulation of 1,2-diacylglycerol. 8. The source of 1,2-diacylglycerol has not been definitely identified, but its fatty acid compositon was similar to that of phosphatidylcholine. However, it has an unusually high content of hexadecenoic acid, a fatty acid not common in the major erythrocyte phospholipids. 9. Accumulation of 1,2-diacyglycerol also occurred in energy-starved cells, even in the absence of calcium; in this case it appeared to be produced by phosphatidate breakdown.	eng	225	232	The Biochemical journal	156	2	1976	May	15	D000255/Q000032;D000900/Q000494;D000001/Q000494;D002118/Q000494;D002462/Q000201;D004533/Q000494;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D005227/Q000032;D005990/Q000031;D005990/Q000378;D005991/Q000032;D006801;D066298;D010712/Q000032;D010712/Q000096;D010743/Q000096;D013997	Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis;Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology;Calcimycin/pharmacology;Calcium/pharmacology;Cell Membrane/enzymology;Egtazic Acid/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fatty Acids/analysis;Glycerol/analogs & derivatives;Glycerol/metabolism;Glycerol Kinase/analysis;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Phosphatidic Acids/analysis;Phosphatidic Acids/biosynthesis;Phospholipids/biosynthesis;Time Factors	Allan D;Watts R;Michell RH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
148	977587	Formation of glutathione conjugates of prostaglandin A1 in human red blood cells.	When prostaglandin A1 was incubated with a Tris/saline suspension of washed human red blood cells, a substantial amount was converted to polar metabolites. These were purified by solvent extraction, XAD-2 column, and cellulose thin layer chromatography and characterized by chromatography, amino acid analysis, and mass spectrometry. The polar metabolites were a mixture of two glutathione conjugates of prostaglandin A1. The first (approximately 40%) was identical with the product of the nonenzymic reaction of glutathione with prostaglandin A1. The second (approximately 60%) was formed from the first by reduction of the 9-keto group of the prostaglandin moiety. The latter compound was also prepared synthetically by treating the glutathione conjugate of prostaglandin A1 with sodium borohydride.	eng	6550	6554	The Journal of biological chemistry	251	21	1976	Nov	10	D004912/Q000378;D005978/Q000097;D006801;D013058;D010084;D011454/Q000097	Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glutathione/blood;Humans;Mass Spectrometry;Oxidation-Reduction;Prostaglandins A/blood	Cagen LM;Fales HM;Pisano JJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
149	1000842	Polyamine distribution in cellular compartments of blood and in aging erythrocytes.	Human blood was separated into pure preparations of erythrocytes, mononuclear leukocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, platelets, and platelet free plasma. The mean concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine per 10(9) cells were found to be several orders of magnitude higher for leukocytes than erythrocytes. There was no significant difference between leukocyte types. Platelets and plasma had relatively low levels in proportion to the amounts contributed by erythrocytes and leukocytes to whole blood. Human erythrocytes were age-separated by density and the changes in polyamine concentrations in maturing erythrocytes were documented. There were highly significant statistical differences between young and old red blood cells for putrescine, spermidine and spermine. The clinical use of red blood cell polyamines as an indicator of the activity of the bone marrow in anemic states is suggested.	eng	71	88	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	73	1	1976	Nov	15	D000328;D001773/Q000378;D001792/Q000166;D001792/Q000378;D004905;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006454/Q000378;D006651;D006801;D008297;D009000/Q000166;D009000/Q000378;D009504/Q000166;D009504/Q000378;D011073/Q000097;D011700/Q000097;D012156/Q000166;D012156/Q000378;D013095/Q000097;D013096/Q000097	Adult;Blood Cells/metabolism;Blood Platelets/cytology;Blood Platelets/metabolism;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Histocytochemistry;Humans;Male;Monocytes/cytology;Monocytes/metabolism;Neutrophils/cytology;Neutrophils/metabolism;Polyamines/blood;Putrescine/blood;Reticulocytes/cytology;Reticulocytes/metabolism;Spermidine/blood;Spermine/blood	Cooper KD;Shukla JB;Rennert OM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
150	8143	Human erythrocyte glutathione reductase. I. Purification and properties.	1. Glutathione reductase (NAD(P)H:oxidized-glutathione oxidoreductase, EC. 1.6.4.2) from human erythrocytes was purified 49 000-fold with an overall yield of 15% and a 280/460 nm absorbance ratio of 6.03. The procedure used was the method of Worthington and Rosemeyer modified by addition of heating and recrystallization. 2. It was concluded from the results of purification, electrofocusing and inhibition studies that glutathione reductase is a single enzyme which used both NADPH and NADH as hydrogen donors. 3. Apoenzyme cross-reacts with the antibody to the holoenzyme but has a slightly reduced affinity to the antibody. Apoenzyme can be removed from the hemolysate by heating and centrifugation without loss of holoenzyme. 4. Indirect immunological assay of the specific activity of the erythrocyte glutathione reductase is possible in the enzyme saturated with FAD.	eng	309	323	Biochimica et biophysica acta	445	2	1976	Sep	14	D004912/Q000201;D005980/Q000097;D005980/Q000302;D005980/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D005779;D007700;D009243;D009249	Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glutathione Reductase/blood;Glutathione Reductase/isolation & purification;Glutathione Reductase/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Immunodiffusion;Kinetics;NAD;NADP	Nakashima K;Miwa S;Yamauchi K	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Human erythrocyte hexokinase (ADP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) was purified 50 000--100 000-fold with a final specific activity of about 25--50 units/mg protein using gel-filtration, ion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromagraphy. 2. After isoelectrofocusing ofthe preparation one major protein band could be detected besides a minor band. THe isoelectric point of the major protein band was found to be 4.7. 3. After purification the enzyme could be stabilized in a medium containing inorganic phosphate, glucose, glycerol and mercaptoethanol. 4. The molecular weight was determined by gel-filtration and was found to be 132 000+/-8000. 5. The enzyme shows a broad pH optimum ranging from 7.0 to 8.4. 6. The kinetic behavior of the purified enzyme at 37 degrees C was somewhat different from the normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics due to its instability. The affinity constants were 0.048--0.080 mM for glucose and 0.57--1.0 mM for Mg-ATP. 7. The enzyme was specific for Mg- ATP as the nucleotide substrate. Mg-UTP, Mg-ITP,Mg-GTP and Mg-CTP were not converted to corresponding diphosphates. Several hexoses could be phosphorylated by the enzyme. Mannose could be phosphorylated at the same rate as glucose, although the affinity for the enzyme was lower (5m=0.60mM). Much lower rates and lower affinities were found with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (5m=1.0mM), D(+)-glucosamine (5m=4.5 mM) and fructose (5m=10 mM). N-acetyl-D-glucosamine , galactose andsorbose were not phosphorylated at all.	eng	330	341	Biochimica et biophysica acta	445	2	1976	Sep	14	D004355;D004912/Q000201;D006593/Q000097;D006593/Q000302;D006801;D007700;D013329	Drug Stability;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Hexokinase/blood;Hexokinase/isolation & purification;Humans;Kinetics;Structure-Activity Relationship	Rijksen G;Staal GE	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Net decrease of the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate level acts as a NAD regenerating system thus facilitating uptake of polyalcohols such as xylitol.	eng	639	643	Acta biologica et medica Germanica	36	5-6	1977			D001786;D002245/Q000097;D004163/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D005632/Q000097;D006601/Q000097;D006801;D007773/Q000097;D009243/Q000097;D010429/Q000097;D011773/Q000097;D012266/Q000097;D014993/Q000097;D014996/Q000097	Blood Glucose;Carbon Dioxide/blood;Diphosphoglyceric Acids/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fructose/blood;Hexoses/blood;Humans;Lactates/blood;NAD/blood;Pentoses/blood;Pyruvates/blood;Ribose/blood;Xylitol/blood;Xylulose/blood	Quadeflieg KH;Brand K	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
154	23635	Regulation of NAD and NADP synthesis in human red cell.	NAD is synthesized in red cell from nicotinic acid and PRPP through the formation of nicotinate mononucleotide and desamido-NAD. Synthesis of one mole of NAD requires two moles of ATP. NADP comes from NAD phosphorylation by NAD-kinase (EC.2.7.1.23). NAD and NADP analysis on a population with ATP level ranging from 800 to 2500 nmoles/ml red cells showed a close correlation between ATP and pyridine cofactors. Moreover, NADP level appeared to be dependent of the redox-state of NADP/NADPH couple. Subjects with low NADPH (G-6-PD) deficient red cells, Hb Köln) showed lower NADtot/NADPtot ratio, suggesting a NAD-kinase equilibrium shift toward NADP related to lower levels of the negative effector NADPH, as already described in rat liver.	eng	759	763	Acta biologica et medica Germanica	36	5-6	1977			D000255/Q000378;D000743/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D005955/Q000097;D006453/Q000097;D006801;D009243/Q000096;D009249/Q000096	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Anemia, Hemolytic/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency/blood;Hemoglobinopathies/blood;Humans;NAD/biosynthesis;NADP/biosynthesis	Pescarmona GP;Bracone A;David O;Sartori ML;Bosia A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True
155	562050	A genetic study of erythrocyte arginine-tRNA synthetase activity in man.	To search for evidence of genetic variation among the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, a semi-automated assay procedure employing a Technicon AutoAnalyzer was used to measure erythrocyte arginine-tRNA synthetase activity in samples obtained from normal human twins of various ages. Variation in enzyme activity within the older DZ twins was five times that of the MZ twins suggesting the existence of genetically determined variation in enzyme activity. Higher enzyme activity was observed in newborn DZ unlike-sexed twins than in like-sexed twins for either zygosity. Possible explanations for this observation are discussed.	eng	21	27	Acta geneticae medicae et gemellologiae	26	1	1977			D000293;D000328;D000368;D000604/Q000235;D001126/Q000235;D002648;D002675;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D005796;D014644;D006801;D007223;D007231;D008297;D008875;D011247;D014427;D014429;D014430	Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases/genetics;Arginine-tRNA Ligase/genetics;Child;Child, Preschool;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Genes;Genetic Variation;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Male;Middle Aged;Pregnancy;Twins;Twins, Dizygotic;Twins, Monozygotic	McCune SA;Yu PL;Nance WE	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
156	403244	L-Dopa peroxidase activity of human erythrocyte catalase.	The human red cell hemolysate was found to have 3-(3',4'-dihydroxphenyl)-L-alanine (L-dopa) peroxidase activity. During the purification of glutathione peroxidase and catalase by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography. Sephadex gel filtration, and preparative polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis, the L-dopa peroxidase activity was found to be associated with catalase. Both sodium azide, 8 mM, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, 50 mM, besides inhibiting catalase, inhibited the L-dopa peroxidase activity in each fraction. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 4 mM, had no effect on catalase or L-dopa peroxidase activity, indicating that the oxidation of L-dopa is not a nonenzymatic process mediated by metal ions. Although the electrophoretic mobility of catalase, L-dopa peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase are similar, a homogeneous preparation of glutathione peroxidase was free of L-dopa peroxidase activity. L-Dopa peroxidase in human red cells was co-purified with catalase.	eng	763	769	The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine	89	4	1977	Apr		D001386/Q000494;D002374/Q000097;D002850;D004492/Q000494;D004591;D004912/Q000201;D006358;D006801;D007980;D010544/Q000097	Azides/pharmacology;Catalase/blood;Chromatography, Gel;Edetic Acid/pharmacology;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Hot Temperature;Humans;Levodopa;Peroxidases/blood	Awasthi YC;Srivastava SK;Snyder LM;Edelstein L;Fortier NL	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
157	558643	Demethylation of O-methyl metabolites of catecholamines in erythrocytes: a methanol-forming reaction.	"When lysates of erythrocytes of 11 species, including man, were incubated at pH 7.8 with L-3-methoxy-4-hydroxy [U-14C]phenylalanine or with [7-3H]normetanephrine, these were demethylated and formed 3,4-dihydroxy[14C]phenylalanine or [3H]norepinephrine. These catechols were identified by column and paper chromatographic methods. When [14C-methoxy]normetanephrine was incubated with lysates of rat erythrocytes, the one-carbon product was identified as [14C]methanol by the isolation in the incubation mixture of [14C]methanol-3,5-dinitrobenzoate and its recrystallization to constant specific radioactivity. Metanephrine, 3-methoxytyramine, vanilmandelic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol were also O-demethylated by rat erythrocytes; epinephrine was not N-demethylated. The reaction was not influenced by the addition of S-adenosylmethionine. The reaction appears to be different from that catalyzed by the ""methanol-forming enzyme"" previously described in erythrocytes and in other tissues."	eng	669	685	Research communications in chemical pathology and pharmacology	16	4	1977	Apr		D000818;D001798/Q000378;D002245/Q000097;D002395/Q000097;D002415;D002417;D010856;D003640;D004285;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D005557/Q000097;D006168;D006801;D066298;D000432/Q000097;D051379;D010090/Q000378;D011485;D011817;D051381;D012756;D001503	Animals;Blood Proteins/metabolism;Carbon Dioxide/blood;Catecholamines/blood;Cats;Cattle;Columbidae;Dealkylation;Dogs;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Formaldehyde/blood;Guinea Pigs;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Methanol/blood;Mice;Oxidoreductases, O-Demethylating/metabolism;Protein Binding;Rabbits;Rats;Sheep;Ursidae	Tyce GM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

159	200994	Angiotensinase activity in red blood cell membranes and intact adrenal cells.	The present study was undertaken to characterize angiotensinase activity in human red blood cells (RBCs), RBC ghosts and rabbit adrenal cells. It was found, by the use of paper chromatography, that each of these preparations possess enzymes capable of converting angiotensin II to its heptapeptide derivative, [des=Asp1] angiotensin II (angiotensin III). Further characterization of these enzymes by the use of a chromogenic assay indicates that although intact RBCs do not split sarcosine-beta-naphthylamide, RBC ghosts do. Intact rabbit adrenal cells from the zona glomerulosa, however, do show activity against sarcosine-beta-naphthylamide. This is interpreted to indicate the presence of non-specific angiotensinases on the inside of the RBC membrane and the outside of the adrenal cell membrane.	eng	697	707	Research communications in chemical pathology and pharmacology	18	4	1977	Dec		D000302/Q000201;D000818;D002854;D010450/Q000378;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D066298;D008027;D011817;D013053	Adrenal Cortex/enzymology;Animals;Chromatography, Paper;Endopeptidases/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Light;Rabbits;Spectrophotometry	Moore AF;Gurchinoff S;Brashear W;Bumpus FM;Chang R;Khairallah PA	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True

A procedure has been developed for the purification of human erythrocyte aldolase (D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-lyase, EC 4.1.2.1.3). The process involves a specific substrate elution of the enzyme from phosphocellulose followed by a reverse ammonium sulfate fractionation. The preparation has been shown to be homogeneous by analytical ultracentrifugation, thin-layer electrophoresis, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The enzyme exhibits a specific activity of 16 I.U./mg protein, a Km of 7.1-10(-6) M for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and a substrate specificity (Fru-1,6-P2/Fru-1-P) of 40. The native protein in a tetramer of 158 000 molecular weight possessing identical or nearly identical subunits, an isoelectric point of 8.9, a diffusion coefficient of 4.68-10(-7) cm2/s, and a molecular radius of 4.56 nm.

172	24639	Inactivation of human gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase by cystamine. Demonstration and quantification of enzyme-ligand complexes.	Human erythrocyte gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase is inactivated by the disulfide cystamine (2,2'-dithiobis-(ethylamine)) at pH 8.2 with a rate constant of 1020 min-1 mM-1. Magnesium ion and various combinations of substrates and products confer differing degrees of protection against cystamine inactivation, thus allowing the detection and quantification of certain enzyme-ligand interactions. By measuring inactivation rates as a function of ligand concentrations in incomplete reaction mixtures, we have obtained evidence for the following complexes: enzyme . Mg2+; enzyme . Mg2+ . MgATP2-; enzyme . Mg2+ . L-glutamate; enzyme . Mg2+ . MgATP2- . L-glutamate; enzyme . Mg2+ . L-gamma-glutamyl-L-alpha-aminobutyrate. The data also imply the existence of enzyme . (Mg2+)2 . MgATP2- .

173	690597	Lithium transport pathways in human red blood cells.	In human red cells, Li is extruded against its own concentration gradient if the external medium contains Na as a dominant cation. This uphill net Li extrusion occurs in the presence of external Na but not K, Rb, Cs, choline, Mg, or Ca, is ouabain-insensitive, inhibited by phloretin, and does not require the presence of cellular ATP. Li influx into human red cells has a ouabain-sensitive and a ouabain-insensitive but phloretin-sensitive component. Ouabain-sensitive Li influx is competitively inhibited by external K and Na and probably involves the site on which the Na-K pump normally transports K into red cells. Ouabain does not inhibit Li efflux from red cells containing Li concentrations below 10 mM in the presence of high internal Na or K, whereas a ouabain-sensitive Li efflux can be measured in cells loaded to contain 140 mM Li in the presence of little or no internal Na or K. Ouabain-insensitive Li efflux is stimulated by external Na and not by K, Rb, Cs, choline, Mg, or Ca ions. Na-dependent Li efflux does not require the presence of cellular ATP and is inhibited by phloretin, furosemide, quinine, and quinidine. Experiments carried out in cells loaded in the presence of nystatin to contain either only K or only Na show that the ouabain-insensitive, phloretin-inhibited Li movements into or out of human red cells are stimulated by Na on the trans side and inhibited by Na on the cis side of the red cell membrane. The characteristics of the Na-dependent unidirectional Li fluxes and uphill Li extrusion are similar, suggesting that they are mediated by the same Na-Li countertransport system.	eng	233	247	The Journal of general physiology	72	2	1978	Aug		D000255/Q000378;D001693/Q000187;D002118/Q000494;D002794/Q000494;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D008094/Q000378;D008274/Q000494;D010042/Q000494;D011188/Q000494;D012413/Q000494;D012964/Q000494	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Biological Transport, Active/drug effects;Calcium/pharmacology;Choline/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Lithium/metabolism;Magnesium/pharmacology;Ouabain/pharmacology;Potassium/pharmacology;Rubidium/pharmacology;Sodium/pharmacology	Pandey GN;Sarkadi B;Haas M;Gunn RB;Davis JM;Tosteson DC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
174	29601	Purification and properties of gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase from human erythrocytes.	1. GAMMA-Glutamylcyclotransferase was purified 10000-fold from human erythrocytes. 2. The purification steps involved fractionation with (NH4)(2)SO(4) and chromatography on Sephadex G-75, DEAE-cellulose and hydroxyapatite. The purified enzyme was found to be homogeneous on density-gradient polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. 3. The maximum reaction rate was observed at pH9.0 and the apparent Km value for gamma-glutamyl-L-alanine was 2.2mM. 4. The molecular weight (25250) of the purified enzyme agreed well with the value (25500) in fresh haemolysates, indicating no apparent structural modification of the enzyme during purification. However, rapid processing of the blood through the initial (NH4)(2)SO(4) and Sephadex-chromatography steps was required to prevent formation of a high-molecular-weight aggregate with substantially lower specific activity. 5. gamma-Glutamylcyclotransferase catalyses the formation of 5-oxoproline from gamma-glutamyl dipeptides. The role of this enzyme in erythrocytes is of particular interest, because gamma-glutamyl-L-cysteine serves as a substrate for both gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase and glutathione synthetase. Thus the cyclotransferase could modulate glutathione synthesis.	eng	427	431	The Biochemical journal	173	2	1978	Aug	01	D000217/Q000097;D055598;D002621;D002848;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006863;D005722/Q000097;D005722/Q000302	Acyltransferases/blood;Chemical Phenomena;Chemistry;Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;gamma-Glutamylcyclotransferase/blood;gamma-Glutamylcyclotransferase/isolation & purification	Board PG;Moore KA;Smith JE	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
175	216002	Compartmentalization of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in human erythrocytes.	The human erythrocyte contains two types of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The membrane-associated protein kinase holoenzyme can be released intact by hypotonic treatment at alkaline pH. Chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and molecular weight determinations demonstrate that this enzyme is a type I cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, while the predominant cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase found in the cytoplasm is type II. The catalytic subunits of the two types of kinase found in the erythrocyte are identical, but the regulatory subunits, which distinguish the two types of kinase, determine their localization within the cell. It is proposed that the regulatory subunit of the type I enzyme, in addition to binding the catalytic subunit, interacts specifically with one or more membrane proteins and that this interaction may serve to position the kinase in preferential proximity to protein substrates.	eng	5926	5930	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	75	12	1978	Dec		D002451;D000242/Q000378;D003593/Q000201;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D046911;D008970;D011092;D011494/Q000097	Cell Compartmentation;Cyclic AMP/metabolism;Cytoplasm/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Macromolecular Substances;Molecular Weight;Polyethylene Glycols;Protein Kinases/blood	Dreyfuss G;Schwartz KJ;Blout ER	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
176	36070	Biochemical characterization of a red cell UMP kinase variant found in the Warao indians of Venezuela.	UMPK 3 is a rare variant of the polymorphic enzyme of human red cells, uridine monophosphate kinase. This homozygote phenotype was detected among the Warao Indians of Venezuela. The UMPK 1 and UMPK 3 enzymes were partially purified following the method described by Tend et al. (1976). The biochemical and kinetic parameters of both variants were studied in crude hemolysates and in partially purified enzymes. A comparison was made with the results previously reported by Teng for UMPK 1 and UMPK 2, and it was concluded that UMPK 3 seems to resemble the other two allelic gene products in Km values for UMP, CMP, and ATP but differs from them in electrophoretic mobility, pH optimum, and thermal stability.	eng	1085	1092	Biochemical genetics	16	11-12	1978	Dec		D000483;D004586;D004912/Q000201;D005787;D006801;D006863;D007199;D007700;D010770/Q000235;D014541/Q000235;D014541/Q000302;D014542/Q000378;D014687	Alleles;Electrophoresis;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Gene Frequency;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Indians, South American;Kinetics;Phosphotransferases/genetics;Uridine Kinase/genetics;Uridine Kinase/isolation & purification;Uridine Monophosphate/metabolism;Venezuela	Gallango ML;Müller A;Suinaga R	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True
177	723629	Pyrimidine metabolism in hereditary erythrocyte pyrimidine 5' nucleotidase deficiency.	A patient with hereditary erythrocyte pyrimidine 5' nucleotidase deficiency was studied to determine the mechanism of accumulation of erythrocyte pyrimidine nucleotides. Estimates of the rate of degradation of uridine nucleotides to diffusable products imply that the high levels found in these patients could not be sustained from the degradative pathways alone. Active synthesis of uridine nucleotides was found to occur in erythrocytes from both patient and control blood samples when either uridine or orotate was used as a substrate. The circulating levels of uridine in the blood are such that sufficient nucleotides to account for the high levels seen in these patients could accumulate in the erythrocytes from biosynthetic pathways alone, quite apart from the contribution from degradation of residual ribosomal RNA. This provides scope for new therapeutic approaches; treatment with allopurinol, however, was found to result in an increase, rather than a decrease, in erythrocyte pyrimidine nucleotides.	eng	1743	1754	Metabolism: clinical and experimental	27	12	1978	Dec		D000293;D000493/Q000627;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D008297;D009708/Q000097;D009708/Q000172;D011686/Q000188;D011686/Q000201;D011686/Q000235;D011743/Q000097	Adolescent;Allopurinol/therapeutic use;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Male;Nucleotidases/blood;Nucleotidases/deficiency;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/drug therapy;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/enzymology;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/genetics;Pyrimidines/blood	Harley EH;Heaton A;Wicomb W	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
178	743227	Purification and characterization of two human erythrocyte arylamidases preferentially hydrolysing N-terminal arginine or lysine residues.	Two arylamidases (I and II) were purified from human erythrocytes by a procedure that comprised removal of haemoglobin from disrupted cells with CM-Sephadex D-50, followed by treatment of the haemoglobin-free preparation subsequently with DEAE-cellulose, gel-permeation chromatography on Sephadex G-200, gradient solubilization on Celite, isoelectric focusing in a pH gradient from 4 to 6, gel-permeation chromatography on Sephadex G-100 (superfine), and finally affinity chromatography on Sepharose 4B covalently coupled to L-arginine. In preparative-scale purifications, enzymes I and II were separated at the second gel-permeation chromatography. Enzyme II was obtained as a homogeneous protein, as shown by several criteria. Enzyme I hydrolysed, with decreasing rates, the L-amino acid 2-naphtylamides of lysine, arginine, alanine, methionine, phenylalanine and leucine, and the reactions were slightly inhibited by 0.2 M-NaCl. Enzyme II hydrolysed most rapidly the corresponding derivatives of arginine, leucine, valine, methionine, proline and alanine, in that order, and the hydrolyses were strongly dependent on Cl-. The hydrolysis of these substrates proceeded rapidly at physiological Cl- concentration (0.15 M). The molecular weights (by gel filtration) of enzymes I and II were 85 000 and 52 500 respectively. The pH optimum was approx. 7.2 for both enzymes. The isoelectric point of enzyme II was approx. 4.8. Enzyme I was activated by Co2+, which did not affect enzyme II to any noticeable extent. The kinetics of reactions catalysed by enzyme I were characterized by strong substrate inhibition, but enzyme II was not inhibited by high substrate concentrations. The Cl- activated enzyme II also showed endopeptidase activity in hydrolysing bradykinin.	eng	1051	1067	The Biochemical journal	175	3	1978	Dec	01	D000596/Q000032;D000626/Q000097;D000626/Q000302;D001120;D055598;D002621;D002712;D002847;D002848;D002853;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006868;D007700;D008239;D013379	Amino Acids/analysis;Aminopeptidases/blood;Aminopeptidases/isolation & purification;Arginine;Chemical Phenomena;Chemistry;Chlorides;Chromatography, Agarose;Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose;Chromatography, Liquid;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydrolysis;Kinetics;Lysine;Substrate Specificity	Mäkinen KK;Mäkinen PL	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

181	203521	Carbon and hydrogen metabolism of xylitol and various sugars in human erythrocytes.	1) Erythrocytes are able to metabolize D-ribose, D-xylitol, D-xylulose, D-fructose and D-glucose; the rates of metabolism increase in that order from 2430 to 26200 ng atom C/ml packed cells per 120 min of incubation. 2) The utilization of the carbon of these substrates and its recovery in the products were found to be in balance, when the change in the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate concentration was taken into account. 3) The metabolic rates strongly affected the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate level. Without addition of substrate the decomposition rate of this intermediate was found to be 1030 nmol/ml packed cells per 120 min. 4) The net decrease of the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate concentration and the conversion of this compound into lactate provides a NAD regeneration system which enables the red blood cells to utilize xylitol. 5) The rate of carbon metabolism via the pentose phosphate cycle is determined by the NADPH requirement of the erythrocytes which was found to be 160 nmol/ml packed cells per 120 min under the experimental conditions employed.	eng	29	36	Hoppe-Seyler's Zeitschrift fur physiologische Chemie	359	1	1978	Jan		D002244/Q000097;D002245/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005994/Q000378;D006801;D006859/Q000097;D007773/Q000378;D009243/Q000378;D011773/Q000378;D014993/Q000097	Carbon/blood;Carbon Dioxide/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycerophosphates/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen/blood;Lactates/metabolism;NAD/metabolism;Pyruvates/metabolism;Xylitol/blood	Quadflieg KH;Brand K	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True

184	624285	Energy metabolism of various substrates and the 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate bypass in human erythrocytes.	1. Using different experimental conditions and applying various substrates, a wide range of metabolic rates could be observed in incubations with human erythrocytes. 2. Lower rates of substrate utilization resulted in a decrease of the ATP and, more pronounced, of the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate concentration while carbon utilization rates beyond 14 mumol C/ml packed cells in 120 min yielded constant levels of ATP and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate indicating that steady state had been achieved. 3. It can be concluded, that a carbon utilization rate of 14 mumol C/ml cells in 120 min is able to cover the energy requirement of the red cells under steady state conditions which could be calculated to amount to 3.6 mumol ATP/ml cells in 120 min at 37 degrees C. 4. The contribution of the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate bypass to carbon metabolism could be calculated to range between 15--25% at metabolic rates below 14 mumol C/ml cells in 120 min (presteady state). When steady state has been achieved, the share of this bypass increases up to 61% with increasing metabolic rates.	eng	523	528	European journal of biochemistry	82	2	1978	Jan	16	D000255/Q000097;D004163/Q000097;D004734;D004912/Q000378;D006019;D006801;D007700;D010710/Q000097	Adenosine Triphosphate/blood;Diphosphoglyceric Acids/blood;Energy Metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycolysis;Humans;Kinetics;Phosphates/blood	Quadflieg KH;Brand K	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
185	413564	Purine nucleoside phosphorylase from human erythrocytes: physiocochemical properties of the crystalline enzyme.	The major physicochemical properties of human erythrocytic purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNPase) have been described. The molecular weight, estimated by ultracentrifugation, molecular sieving and sucrose density gradient centrifugation, ranged from 87 000 to 92 000. Other physical constants of erythrocytic PNPase were: sedimentation coefficent (s20, w), 5.4 S obtained by sedimentation analysis and 5.5 S by the sucrose density gradient procedure; Stokes radius, 38 A; calculated diffusion coefficient (D20, w), 5.7 X 10(-7) cm2 s-1; frictional ration, 1.29; and partial specific volume calculated from amino acid analysis, 0.73 cm3 g-1. The CD spectra of the human erythrocytic and bovine spleen PNPases were almost identical and indicated a very low alpha-helical content. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that the molecular weight of the PNPase subunit is 30 000 +/- 500. These results corroborate earlier reports that the native enzyme is a homologous trimer. Comparative studies with crystalline bovine spleen PNPase confirmed that it is also a trimer but is somewhat smaller than the human erythrocytic enzyme with a molecular weight of about 86 000.	eng	278	283	Biochemistry	17	2	1978	Jan	24	D000596/Q000032;D002499;D002850;D002942;D004586;D004589;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008970;D010430/Q000097;D011487;D011683/Q000097;D013154/Q000201;D014461	Amino Acids/analysis;Centrifugation, Density Gradient;Chromatography, Gel;Circular Dichroism;Electrophoresis;Electrophoresis, Disc;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Molecular Weight;Pentosyltransferases/blood;Protein Conformation;Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/blood;Spleen/enzymology;Ultracentrifugation	Stoeckler JD;Agarwal RP;Agarwal KC;Schmid K;Parks RE	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
186	412851	Purification and characterization of human erythrocyte purine nucleoside phosphorylase and its subunits.	Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.1; purine nucleoside:orthophosphate ribosyltransferase) from fresh human erythrocytes has been purified to homogeneity in two steps with an overall yield of 56%. The purification involves DEAE-Sephadex chromatography followed by affinity chromatography on a column of Sepharose/formycin B. This scheme is suitable for purification of the phosphorylase from as little as 0.1 ml of packed erythrocytes. The native enzyme appears to be a trimer with native molecular weight of 93,800 and the subunit molecular weight of 29,700 +/- 1,100. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme under denaturing conditions revealed four major separable subunits (numbered 1 to 4) with the same molecular weight. The apparent isoelectric points of subunits 1 to 4 in 9.5 M urea are 6.63, 6.41, 6.29, and 6.20, respectively. The different subunits are likely the result of post-translational modification of the enzyme and provide an explanation of the complex native isoelectric focusing pattern of purine nucleoside phosphorylase from erythrocytes. Three of the four subunits are detectable in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels of crude hemolysates. Knowing the location of the subunits of purine nucleoside phosphorylase in a two-dimensional electropherogram allows one to characterize the purine nucleoside phosphorylase in crude cell extracts from individuals with variant or mutant purine nucleoside phosphorylase as demonstrated in a subsequent communication. Partial purification of the phosphorylase from 1 ml of erythrocytes on DEAE-Sephadex increases the sensitivity of detection of the subunits to the 0.3% level.	eng	504	510	The Journal of biological chemistry	253	2	1978	Jan	25	D004912/Q000201;D006801;D046911;D008970;D010430/Q000097;D011683/Q000097;D011683/Q000302	Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Macromolecular Substances;Molecular Weight;Pentosyltransferases/blood;Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/blood;Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/isolation & purification	Zannis V;Doyle D;Martin DW	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Since limited quantities of the homogeneous enzyme were available, the kinetic properties of a nonhomogeneous preparation purified about 20,000-fold over the red blood cell lysate by phosphocellulose chromatography were examined. Like the muscle enzyme, it exhibits a sigmoid AMP saturation curve in the absence of activating monovalent cations; a hyperbolic saturation curve is observed in the presence of 0.15 M KCl.

188	658615	Characteristics of human erythrocyte insulin receptors.	Highly specific insulin receptors have been identified on human erythrocytes. A modification of the monocyte insulin radioreceptor technique permitted distinct separation of human erythrocytes with their bound insulin from the free insulin. When incubated with 80 pg. per milliliter of 125I-insulin (pH 8.0, 3.5 hours, 15 degrees C.), erythrocytes from 17 normal volunteers specifically bound 10 per cent (+/- 1.450 S.D.) of the total 125I-insulin. Less than 15 per cent of the total 125I-insulin bound was nonspecific. Binding of 125I-insulin to human erythrocytes was dependent on pH and temperature. Less than 5 per cent of the insulin available to the plasma membrane was degraded. Both calcium and magnesium enhanced 125I-insulin binding by 100 per cent but had no synergistic effect when mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio. Scatchard analysis of the binding data resulted in a curvilinear plot with characteristics typical of negative cooperative interactions between receptor sites and with an unoccupied site affinity constant of 0.1 X 10(8) M-1. Human erythrocytes have 2,000 insulin binding sites per erythrocyte with 14 sites per square micrometer of surface area. The readily available human erythrocyte, thus, has both specific insulin binding sites and binding characteristics similar to other human cell types. These studies have provided the basis for further clinical investigation of polypeptide hormone receptors on human erythrocytes.	eng	701	708	Diabetes	27	7	1978	Jul		D000293;D000328;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007328/Q000097;D007700;D011972/Q000378	Adolescent;Adult;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Insulin/blood;Kinetics;Receptor, Insulin/metabolism	Gambhir KK;Archer JA;Bradley CJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

192	276878	Enzymatic synthesis and rapid translocation of phosphatidylcholine by two methyltransferases in erythrocyte membranes.	The synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylethanolamine is carried out by two methyltransferases in erythrocyte membranes. The first enzyme uses phosphatidylethanolamine as a substrate, requires Mg2+, and has a high affinity for methyl donor, S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The second enzyme methylates phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine and has a low affinity for S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The first enzyme is localized on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and the second enzyme faces the external surface. This asymmetric arrangement of the two enzymes across the membrane makes possible the stepwide methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine localized on the cytoplasmic side and facilitates the rapid transmembrane transfer of the final product, phosphatidylcholine, to the external surface of the membrane. A mechanism for an enzyme-mediated flip-flop of phospholipids from the cytoplasmic to the outer surface of erythrocyte membranes is described.	eng	2348	2352	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	75	5	1978	May		D000818;D001692;D004910/Q000201;D004910/Q000378;D004910/Q000648;D004912/Q000378;D008297;D008563/Q000097;D008780/Q000097;D010713/Q000096;D010713/Q000097;D010713/Q000378;D010714/Q000378;D051381	Animals;Biological Transport;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/ultrastructure;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Male;Membrane Lipids/blood;Methyltransferases/blood;Phosphatidylcholines/biosynthesis;Phosphatidylcholines/blood;Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism;Phosphatidylethanolamines/metabolism;Rats	Hirata F;Axelrod J	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
193	659590	The mechanism of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate transport by human erythrocytes.	The mechanism involved in 5-methyltetrahydrofolate uptake by human cells is poorly understood. To more clearly elucidate this physiologically important process, transport of the vitamin was studied in human erythrocytes. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate uptake was found to increase with reticulocytosis, but measurable incorporation occurred in erythrocyte suspensions depleted of reticulocytes, leukocytes, and platelets, indicating uptake by mature erythrocytes. Incubation of erythrocytes with increasing concentrations of [(14)C]5-methyltetrahydrofolate resulted in increasing uptake but decreasing percentage incorporation, consistent with saturation of a carrier system. Both influx and efflux phases of uptake were temperature dependent, with almost no transport at 4 degrees C. Uptake of [(14)C]5-methytetrahydrofolate was effectively inhibited by unlabeled 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and methotrexate, but not by pteroylglutamic acid. Prior incubation with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate increased uptake of [(14)C]5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and extracellular 5-formyltetrahydrofolate enhanced efflux of [(14)C]5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Nearly total depletion of ATP increased uptake of [(14)C]5-methyltetrahydrofolate, but efflux was unchanged. Column chromatography of membrane-free hemolysate after incubation with [(14)C]5-methyltetrahydrofolate showed 95% of radioactivity corresponded to marker radioisotope, and no other peak was noted. Thus peripheral erythrocytes incorporate 5-methyltetrahydrofolate by a saturable, temperature-dependent, substrate-specific process which is influenced by counter-transport. This mechanism is qualitatively similar to the carrier-mediated transport of folate compounds previously described in other cell types. Therefore, human erythrocytes should be useful for detailed characterization of this membrane carrier system.	eng	1270	1275	The Journal of clinical investigation	61	5	1978	May		D000741/Q000097;D001692/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008727/Q000494;D012156/Q000378;D013696;D013763/Q000097;D013763/Q000494	Anemia, Aplastic/blood;Biological Transport/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Methotrexate/pharmacology;Reticulocytes/metabolism;Temperature;Tetrahydrofolates/blood;Tetrahydrofolates/pharmacology	Branda RF;Anthony BK;Jacob HS	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

"A radiochemical micromethod for the determination of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity in human red blood cells (RBC) is described. Both 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine were substrates for the TPMT activity in the human RBC. Apparent Michaelis-Menten (KM) values for 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine were 3.2 X 10(-4) M and 2.0 X 10(-4) M, respectively. The apparent KM value for S-adenosyl-L-methionine, a co-substrate for the reaction, was 1.7 X 10(-6) M. The pH optimum for the reaction was approximately 7.5. Blood samples from 73 randomly selected adult subjects had a mean activity of 10.2 +/- 2.4 (mean +/- S.D.) units/ml packed red blood cells. The range of activities was from 4.6 to 14.2 units/ml. The results of experiments in which partially purified human kidney TPMT was added to RBC lysates and of experiments in which ""low"" and ""high"" activity lysates were mixed gave no indication that individual variations in RBC TPMT activity were due to endogenous inhibitors or activators of the enzyme."	eng	323	333	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	85	3	1978	May	02	D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007668/Q000201;D007700;D008780/Q000097;D008780/Q000302;D011687	Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kidney/enzymology;Kinetics;Methyltransferases/blood;Methyltransferases/isolation & purification;Purines	Weinshilboum RM;Raymond FA;Pazmiño PA	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
195	656444	Purification and kinetic properties of human erythrocyte Mg2+-dependent inorganic pyrophosphatase.	Inorganic pyrophosphatase (pyrophosphate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.1) from human erythrocyte hemolysates has been purified up to 10 000-fold. The purified enzyme is homogenous and has a specific activity of 79.75 mumol PPi hydrolysed.min-1.mg-1 at pH 8 and 37 degrees C. It was confirmed that it is a dimer with a molecular weight of 42 000, composed of two identical protomers. From kinetic studies, it is proposed that human erythrocyte inorganic pyrophosphatase activity depends on free Mg2+ concentration in different ways. This ion constitutes part of the substrate (the Mg.PPi complex; Km = 1.4.10(-4) M) and probably acts as an allosteric activator (kinetic activation constant: KMg2+a = 7.5.10(-4) M). Equilibrium binding studies performed in the absence of PPi showed 4 binding sites for Mg2+, all having the same high affinity (dissociation constant: KMg2+d = 4.10(-6) M). Since the concentration of free Mg2+ in red blood cells is very low and may vary with the oxygenation state, it is likely that in vivo erythrocyte pyrophosphatase activity is regulated.	eng	198	206	Biochimica et biophysica acta	524	1	1978	May	11	D004789;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008274/Q000494;D011755/Q000097;D011755/Q000302	Enzyme Activation;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Magnesium/pharmacology;Pyrophosphatases/blood;Pyrophosphatases/isolation & purification	Thuillier L	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
196	708891	Creatine kinase in human erythrocytes: a newly detected genetic anomaly.	In a family of Italian origin, we found four members with a considerable activity of creatine kinase inside their erythrocytes. All other clinical and hematological findings were normal. The enzyme anomaly seems to be inherited in the autosomal mode. The creatine kinase CK) activity in freshly drawn blood was about 12 U/g Hb. The activity was higher in young red cells than in older ones. Studies with specific antibodies against human CK isoenzymes revealed the CK activity in the probands' red cells to be due to about 90% to the BB-isoenzyme normally found in brain and nerve tissue. The presence of CK in the erythrocytes does not seem to have any consequences for the energy metabolism of the cells. Creatine concentration was slightly elevated, but creatine phosphate could not be detected.	eng	249	256	Blut	37	5	1978	Nov	13	D000328;D002675;D003401/Q000097;D003402/Q000097;D003402/Q000235;D004912/Q000032;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007223;D007527/Q000097;D008297;D010725/Q000097	Adult;Child, Preschool;Creatine/blood;Creatine Kinase/blood;Creatine Kinase/genetics;Erythrocytes/analysis;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Infant;Isoenzymes/blood;Male;Phosphocreatine/blood	Arnold H;Löhr GW;Scheuerbrandt G;Beckmann R	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
197	214140	Further characterization of human erythrocyte superoxide dismutase.	1. A simplified procedure for the preparation of highly purified human superoxide dismutase from erythrocytes was developed which avoided extremes of pH and ionic strength and the use of organic solvents; the properties of human and bovine proteins, prepared by the method, were compared. 2. Using the two dimensional electrophoretic procedure of O'Farrell, the human superoxide dismutase was found to consist of a single type of polypeptide. 3. The human protein was found to have a total of eight half-cystine residues per mole of protein, compared to six such residues for the bovine protein. The human protein has two sulfhydryl groups which are reactive toward mercurials when dissolved in 1M guanidine-hydrochloride and approximately 3 reactive sulfhydrls when the protein is dissolved in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The distribution of the eight sulfur atoms appears to consist of four involved in disulfide linkages, two deeply buried within the molecule and unreactive except under strongly denaturing conditions, and two which are reactive under mildly denaturing conditions. No zero-valent sulfur was found. 4. The visible optical absorption, the visible circular dichroism, and the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra are essentially identical with those of the bovine protein. No unusual absorbance was found at 330 nm. The near ultraviolet spectrum is different from that of the bovine protein, and this appears to be due to differing amino acid compositions. 5. Two fractions of superoxide dismutase activity were observed during chromatography of partially purified solutions on diethylaminoethyl-cellulose. The minor, less mobile form, was found to revert to the less mobile species on aging; the reverse process was not observed to occur. The minor component was found to contain equimolar amounts of Zn and Cu and to have a specific dismutase activity somewhat higher than that of the purified major fraction.	eng	86	99	Biochimica et biophysica acta	537	1	1978	Nov	20	D000596/Q000032;D002942;D003300/Q000032;D004220/Q000032;D004578;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008970;D011487;D013053;D013482/Q000097;D013482/Q000302;D015032/Q000032	Amino Acids/analysis;Circular Dichroism;Copper/analysis;Disulfides/analysis;Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Molecular Weight;Protein Conformation;Spectrophotometry;Superoxide Dismutase/blood;Superoxide Dismutase/isolation & purification;Zinc/analysis	Briggs RG;Fee JA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
198	722542	Effects of temperature on the transport of galactose in human erythrocytes.	The transport of galactose in human erythrocytes has been resolved recently into a mechanism which involves two asymmetric carriers operating in antiparallel fashion. The effects of temperature on this mediated transport system in the range of 0--25 degrees C show the following features. The Michaelis constants for zero-trans influx and efflux and for equilibrium-exchange efflux, do not vary with temperature. Arrhenius plots of the maximal velocities show breaks between 3 and 15 degrees C with activation energies two- to threefold larger below the break than above it. The relative contribution of the two types of carriers to the total transport rate is not affected by temperature. The kinetic properties of the prevalent type of carriers are analysed in terms of the simple carrier model as formulated by Lieb & Stein (1974). This analysis shows that the relative concentration of the unloaded carrier at the inner interface of the membrane increases upon cooling. The free energy of translocation of the unloaded carrier and the change in entropy involved in this step are significantly larger in the low temperature range (0--5 degrees C) than in the higher range (15--25 degrees C). The results are discussed briefly in terms of possible lipid-protein interaction and the physicochemical nature of the erythrocyte membrane.	eng	399	417	The Journal of physiology	282		1978	Sep		D001692;D004912/Q000378;D005690/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008954;D013696;D013816	Biological Transport;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Galactose/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Models, Biological;Temperature;Thermodynamics	Ginsburg H;Yeroushalmy S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

202	222812	Catecholamine regulation of human erythrocyte membrane protein kinase.	The effect of catecholamines on membrane-associated protein kinase in the mature human erythrocyte was investigated. Protein kinase activity was assayed after isolation of membranes from intact erythrocytes incubated with and without catecholamines. Activation of the enzyme is expressed as the ratio of the extent of phosphorylation of exogenous protein substrate in the absence to that in the presence of 2.5 microM cyclic AMP (cAMP). The potent beta-adrenergic agonist, (-)isoproterenol (2 microM), (-)epinephrine (10 microM) and (-)norepinephrine (10 microM) stimulated the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in membranes, 38 +/- 7%, 31 +/- 6%, and 30 +/- 6%, respectively. Maximal stimulation of membrane protein kinase by 10 microM (-)epinephrine was obtained approximately equal to 30 min after initiation of the incubation of erythrocytes with the hormone. The concentrations of (-)catecholamines that gave half-maximal stimulation of the membrane protein kinase were 0.17 microM for isoproterenol, 0.35 microM for epinephrine, and 0.63 microM for norepinephrine. The membrane protein kinase response to beta-adrenergic agonists was found to be stereospecific. The stimulation of membrane protein kinase by 10 microM (-)epinephrine was inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonist, (-)propranolol with EC50 = 0.60 microM, and the inhibition of agonist stimulation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase by propranolol was stereospecific. These studies suggest that a functional beta-adrenergic receptor exists in the mature human erythrocyte.	eng	534	540	The Journal of clinical investigation	64	2	1979	Aug		D002395/Q000494;D000242/Q000494;D004789/Q000187;D004837/Q000494;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007545/Q000494;D009638/Q000494;D011433/Q000494;D011479/Q000378;D011494/Q000378	Catecholamines/pharmacology;Cyclic AMP/pharmacology;Enzyme Activation/drug effects;Epinephrine/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Isoproterenol/pharmacology;Norepinephrine/pharmacology;Propranolol/pharmacology;Protamines/metabolism;Protein Kinases/metabolism	Tsukamoto T;Sonenberg M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
203	222854	Evidence for transfer of folate compounds by a specialized erythrocyte membrane system.	Transfer of folate compounds was studied in human erythrocytes. At steady state, the measured distribution ratio of 5-CH3-H4-folate in erythrocyte suspensions exceeded the ratio predicted from the chloride distribution ratio by a factor of 1.58, suggesting that human erythrocytes concentrate folate. Because folate compounds are anionic at physiologic pH, we investigated the possibility that transport occurs via the inorganic anion channel associated with the predominant integral membrane protein, band 3. Erythrocyte uptake of 5-CH3-H4-folate was decreased (60% to 80%) by several known inhibitors of anion transport--pyridoxal phosphate, dipyridamole, phlorizin, and SITS. However, unlike the inorganic anion transfer system, 5-CH3-H4-folate uptake was only slightly decreased by DIDS; was reduced 50% to 70% by the sulfhydryl reagents NEM, PMB, and pCMBS; and was not affected by the proteolytic enzymes trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pronase. These studies suggest that folate compounds are transported by a specialized carrier system, independent of the inorganic anion channel, which contains sulfhydryl and amino groups. In contrast to 5-CH3-H4-folate transfer, uptake of pteroylglutamic acid was either unaffected or somewhat increased by these membrane modifications. This result indicates that the human erythrocyte transports the reduced and oxidized forms of the vitamin by entirely separate mechanisms.	eng	354	360	The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine	94	2	1979	Aug		D002731/Q000494;D001693/Q000187;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005033/Q000494;D005492/Q000097;D006801;D006902/Q000494;D007700;D013763/Q000097	4-Chloromercuribenzenesulfonate/pharmacology;Biological Transport, Active/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology;Folic Acid/blood;Humans;Hydroxymercuribenzoates/pharmacology;Kinetics;Tetrahydrofolates/blood	Branda RF;Anthony BK	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

The enzyme has a relatively low Km for NAD (15 microM) and a high sensitivity to disulfiram. Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme activity rapidly and this inhibition is apparently of a non-competitive nature. In kinetic characteristic and sensitivity to disulfiram, erythrocyte aldehyde dehydrogenase closely resembles the cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase found in the liver of various species of mammalians.	eng	117	123	Biochimica et biophysica acta	569	2	1979	Aug	15	D000445/Q000037;D000445/Q000097;D000445/Q000302;D000447/Q000494;D002697/Q000494;D004221/Q000494;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008297;D008970;D009243/Q000378;D013379	Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/blood;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/isolation & purification;Aldehydes/pharmacology;Chloral Hydrate/pharmacology;Disulfiram/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Male;Molecular Weight;NAD/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Inoue K;Nishimukai H;Yamasawa K	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
206	42911	Uroporphyrinogen I synthase from human erythrocytes: separation, purification, and properties of isoenzymes.	Uroporphyrinogen I synthase [porphobilinogen ammonia-lyase (polymerizing), EC 4.3.1.8] from human erythrocytes was separated into two active protein peaks (A and B on DEAE-cellulose, by ammonium sulfate fractionation, on Sephadex G-100, and on DEAE-Sephadex A-50 with a NaCl gradient. The final purification was 613 and 743 times for A and B, respectively. The corresponding yields were 2.2 and 3.4% Fraction A was separated further into two (A1 and A2) active protein bands and fraction B into three (B1, B2, and B3) on analytical polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. Bands A1 and A2 were identical with B1 and B2; B3 represented a third isoenzyme. Molecular weights (mean +/- SEM), measured by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were 38,000 +/- 1000 for B1 and 40,000 +/- 1000 for B2 and B3. Isoelectric focusing on 4% polyacrylamide gel separated both fractions A and B into three active protein bands. Maximal activity of the enzyme was found in gel cuts (5-mm) at pH 5.6 for both fractions A and B.	eng	6172	6176	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	76	12	1979	Dec		D000642/Q000097;D002845/Q000379;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006863;D011163/Q000097;D007526;D007527/Q000097;D007700;D008970	Ammonia-Lyases/blood;Chromatography/methods;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase/blood;Isoelectric Point;Isoenzymes/blood;Kinetics;Molecular Weight	Miyagi K;Kaneshima M;Kawakami J;Nakada F;Petryka ZJ;Watson CJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
207	284418	Comparison of structure and function of human erythrocyte and human muscle actin.	Human erythrocyte actin and human skeletal muscle actin were purified by acetone powder extraction and gel filtration. Pure human erythrocyte actin resembles muscle actin in its polymerization and depolymerization by phalloidin, cytochalasin B, and DNase I, in its peptide mapping pattern, and in the amino acid composition of corresponding peptides. Isoelectric focusing gel analysis showed that human erythrocyte actin exists in the beta/gamma form, but muscle actin is in the alpha form. Abnormal deformability of resealed erythrocyte membranes was observed after incorporation of the actin-specific agents, phalloidin and DNase I, suggesting that erythrocyte actin might function as a membrane structural element to maintain erythrocyte membrane deformability.	eng	935	938	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	76	2	1979	Feb		D000199/Q000032;D000199/Q000097;D000596/Q000032;D003571/Q000378;D003851/Q000378;D004910/Q000032;D006801;D007525;D009132/Q000032;D010446/Q000032;D010590/Q000378;D011485;D011487	Actins/analysis;Actins/blood;Amino Acids/analysis;Cytochalasin B/metabolism;Deoxyribonucleases/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/analysis;Humans;Isoelectric Focusing;Muscles/analysis;Peptide Fragments/analysis;Phalloidine/metabolism;Protein Binding;Protein Conformation	Nakashima K;Beutler E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

209	31942	Alpha-mannosidase in human red cells.	1. A search for lysosomal hydrolases and related enzymes has been made in hemolysates from human and rabbit red cells. Apart from acid phosphatases, significant activities were found only for alpha-mannosidase, neutral alpha-glucosidase and beta-hexosaminidase. 2. alpha-Mannosidase (alpha-D-mannoside mannohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.24) activity per cell in human red blood cells was 200-times lower than in white cells. The optimal pH was 5.5--6.0. Electrophoresis on cellulose acetate showed three bands. Hemolysates from four patients with mannosidosis were not deficient in alpha-mannosidase. pH activity curves and elctrophoretic pattern were similar to those of controls. From its biochemical and genetic properties, it is concluded that red cell mannosidase differs from the lysosomal acid mannosidase.	eng	67	71	Biochimica et biophysica acta	566	1	1979	Jan	12	D000818;D002239/Q000201;D004586;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006863;D008247/Q000201;D008358/Q000378;D008361/Q000378;D011817;D014018	Animals;Carbohydrate Metabolism, Inborn Errors/enzymology;Electrophoresis;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Lysosomes/enzymology;Mannose/metabolism;Mannosidases/metabolism;Rabbits;Tissue Distribution	Poenaru L;Dreyfus JC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
210	38827	Elevation of pyrimidine enzyme activities in the RBC of patients with congenital hypoplastic anaemia and their parents.	The activities of orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRT) and orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase (ODC) were significantly elevated (P less than 0.001) in erythrocytes (RBC) from five patients with prednisone-responsive congenital hypoplastic anaemia (CHA). (OPRT: patients - 10.1--64.2 nmol/h/10(9) RBC; controls - 2.8 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- SEM, n = 37); ODC: patients = 30--124 nmol/h/10(9) RBC; controls = 10.2 +/- 0.7 (mean SEM, n = 37).) Two patients had a less pronounced, but significant, increase of aspartate transcarbamylase activity and three patients had marginal increases of dihydroorotase activity. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity was not detected in any CHA patient or control. In one patient prior to prednisone therapy, the OPRT and ODT activities were elevated 10-fold and remained elevated 3-fold after 16 months of therapy. An elevated enzyme pattern similar to that of RBC from CHA patients was observed in three parents of three CHA patients, but not in three parents of two other CHA patients. The activities of all five pyrimidine enzymes were normal for one patient with transient erythroblastopenia of childhood. In contrast, the activities of all the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes were elevated in blood from patients with a young RBC population: sickle cell anaemia, sickle-beta-thalassaemia, hereditary spherocytosis, and DiGuglielmo syndrome and from the newborn. It is postulated that factors which affect the activities of pyrimidine enzymes in CHA may also result in diminished erythropoiesis.	eng	381	390	British journal of haematology	42	3	1979	Jul		D000293;D000328;D000741/Q000151;D000741/Q000201;D000741/Q000235;D001221/Q000097;D002262/Q000097;D002648;D002675;D004080/Q000097;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D008297;D008875;D009962/Q000097;D009964/Q000097;D010430/Q000097;D011241/Q000627	Adolescent;Adult;Anemia, Aplastic/congenital;Anemia, Aplastic/enzymology;Anemia, Aplastic/genetics;Aspartate Carbamoyltransferase/blood;Carboxy-Lyases/blood;Child;Child, Preschool;Dihydroorotase/blood;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Orotate Phosphoribosyltransferase/blood;Orotidine-5'-Phosphate Decarboxylase/blood;Pentosyltransferases/blood;Prednisone/therapeutic use	Zielke HR;Ozand PT;Luddy RE;Zinkham WH;Schwartz AD;Sevdalian DA	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True

213	455720	An assay for human erythrocyte catechol-O-methyltransferase activity using a catechol estrogen as the substrate.	A radiometric assay for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity in human erythrocytes is described that employs 2-hydroxy[3H]estrone, and non-radiolabeled S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as the cosubstrates. The ease of separation of the product of the reaction, 2-methoxy[3H]estrone from 2-hydroxy[3H]estrone makes it possible to achieve low reaction blanks. The assay is very sensitive, and only 200 microliter of whole blood are used per determination. The assay is highly reproducible. The interassay variability (coefficient of variation) was 6.5% for 24 assays of COMT activity in red blood cells in blood obtained daily for 24 days from one person. In incubations conducted at 37 degrees C for 30 min, the catechol-O-methyltransferase activity was a linear function of enzyme concentration (equivalent to 11 to 180 microliter of packed red blood cells). Employing this assay, we evaluated the catalytic conversion of 2-hydroxyestrone to 2-methoxyestrone by catechol-O-methyltransferase from human red blood cells and found that the apparent Michaelis constant and the apparent maximal rate of reaction were 3 x 10(-7) M and 6.7 x 10(-9) mol . ml-1 erythrocytes . h-1, respectively. The catechol-O-methyltransferase activity measured in erythrocytes obtained from 100 healthy subjects (men and nonpregnant women) was 8.2 +/- 0.17 (mean +/- S.E.) nmol 2-methoxyestrone . ml-1 erythrocytes . h-1.	eng	63	71	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	94	1	1979	May	16	D002250;D002394/Q000097;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006894;D007553;D007700;D008274/Q000494;D012436;D014316	Carbon Radioisotopes;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/blood;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydroxyestrones;Isotope Labeling;Kinetics;Magnesium/pharmacology;S-Adenosylmethionine;Tritium	Bates GW;Edman CD;Porter JC;Johnston JM;MacDonald PC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
214	36146	Urate transport in human red blood cells. Activation by ATP.	Urate transport in human erythrocytes were measured and compared to previous observations by other authors regarding inorganic anions, especially chloride. Conclusions wwere as follows: 1. Urate influx as a function of increasing concentrations showed saturation kinetics. 2. The effects of pH and of several passive anion transport inhibitors such as dinitrofluorobenzene, sodium salicylate, sodium benzoate and phenylbutazone suggest that urate and chloride are transported by different mechanisms. 3. Urate influx seems to depend on intracellular glycolysis. The results obtained on red blood cells after glycolysis inhibition agree with those obtained on ghosts where metabolism does not take place. 4. The large drop in urate influxes into erythrocytes in the presence of a glycolysis inhibitor and of a passive ion transport inhibitor seems to argue in favour of a dual urate transport mechanism, one for passive diffusion and the other connected with glycolysis. 5. The drop in the urate influx into ghosts in the absence of ATP suggests that the latter might intervene in urate transport by human red cell membranes.	eng	284	294	Biochimica et biophysica acta	553	2	1979	May	17	D000255/Q000494;D000838;D001693/Q000187;D002712/Q000097;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006019;D006801;D006863;D007700;D013268;D014527/Q000097	Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology;Anions;Biological Transport, Active/drug effects;Chlorides/blood;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycolysis;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Stimulation, Chemical;Uric Acid/blood	Lucas-Heron B;Fontenaille C	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True

The common type of pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate kinase (ATP:CMP phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.4.14), purified 50 000-fold from human erythrotes, reacted with a wide variety of nucleotides, but only ATP, dATP, UMP and CMP were good substrates. The optimum Mg2+ concentration, 2-3 mM, was generally independent of substrate concentration, of the nature of the substrate, and of the direction of the reaction. Kinetic studies indicated that a ternary complex was formed, that the substrates were bound at two unlike sites, and that the order of addition of substrates was random. Equilibrium constants were ATP + UMP 0.98, ATP + CMP 1.59, dATP + UMP 1.13, and ATP + AMP 1.20.	eng	45	54	Biochimica et biophysica acta	571	1	1979	Nov	09	D000255/Q000378;D003568/Q000378;D003838/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008274/Q000378;D009703/Q000037;D009703/Q000097;D010770/Q000097;D011741/Q000097;D013379;D014542/Q000378	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Cytidine Monophosphate/metabolism;Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Magnesium/metabolism;Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors;Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/blood;Phosphotransferases/blood;Pyrimidine Nucleosides/blood;Substrate Specificity;Uridine Monophosphate/metabolism	Scott EM;Wright RC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True

Five equine erythrocyte peptidases appeared homologous to human peptidases A, B, D, E, and F. In contrast to human, equine peptidase C was absent in red cells, although it was weakly active in white cells. On the other hand, an equine peptidase, probably homologous to human peptidase S, was weakly active in red cells as well as present in white cells. Polymorphism for equine erythrocyte peptidase A is reported.	eng	987	994	Biochemical genetics	17	9-10	1979	Oct		D000818;D004912/Q000201;D006736/Q000235;D006801;D007962/Q000201;D010447/Q000235;D010447/Q000378;D010641;D011110;D013379	Animals;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Horses/genetics;Humans;Leukocytes/enzymology;Peptide Hydrolases/genetics;Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Genetic;Substrate Specificity	Yut J;Weitkamp LR	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
217	487601	Human inosine triphosphatase: catalytic properties and population studies.	Using a reliable 2-step colorimetric assay, some catalytic properties of human erythrocyte ITPase (inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase) (EC 3.6.1.19) were determined. The enzyme hydrolyses ITP, dITP (deoxyinosine triphosphate) and XTP (xanthine triphosphate) but not other nucleotides. IDP is a competitive inhibitor. Subcellular fractionation of cultured lymphoid-line cells showed ITPase activity to be in the cytosol. ATP and GTP hydrolysing activities were not enriched in the cytosol fraction. The range of activity was investigated in erythrocytes, peripheral leukocytes, amniotic fluid cells, skin fibroblasts, long term lymphoid lines and bone marrow fibroblasts. The mean ITPase activity was found to vary in different cell types from 4.9 to 294 units per mg protein. Fractionation of red blood cells by age revealed that the enzyme decays exponentially with erythrocyte age with a half-life of 35 days. The enzyme had a wide range of specific activity in erythrocytes from 150 normal randomly selected individuals (15--722 pmol/h/g Hb). Within the low range of erythrocyte specific activities (from 15 to 200) a correlation was found between an individual's erythrocyte activity and the activity in peripheral leukocytes. This correlation was not found at higher erythrocyte ITPase activities. Two individuals were detected who had erythrocyte ITPase activities which were close to the lowest ITPase activities of all samples tested. Thus, low or absent ITPase activity is an individual characteristic which may be expressed both in erythrocytes and in other cell types.	eng	143	153	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	97	2-3	1979	Oct	01	D002460;D004905;D004912/Q000201;D005347/Q000201;D006801;D007293;D008607/Q000201;D007962/Q000201;D008221/Q000201;D011755/Q000097;D011755/Q000172;D011755/Q000378;D012559/Q000201;D013347/Q000201;D000097630	Cell Line;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Fibroblasts/enzymology;Humans;Inosine Triphosphate;Intellectual Disability/enzymology;Leukocytes/enzymology;Lymphoid Tissue/enzymology;Pyrophosphatases/blood;Pyrophosphatases/deficiency;Pyrophosphatases/metabolism;Schizophrenia/enzymology;Subcellular Fractions/enzymology;Inosine Triphosphatase	Holmes SL;Turner BM;Hirschhorn K	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True

219	93000	Glutathione thiol esterases of human red blood cells. Fractionation by gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing.	The number and the substrate specificities of glutathione thiol esterases of human red blood cells have been investigated by gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing and staining methods devised for the location of these enzymes on gels. Several glutathione thiol esterase forms, both unspecific (with respect to the S-acyl group of the substrate) and specific were found. Electrophoresis on both polyacrylamide and agarose gels resolved three enzyme components with apparently similar substrate specificity. Isoelectric focusing in liquid column separated two unspecific thiol esterase components with S-lactoylglutathione (pI = 8.4) and S-propionylglutathione (pI = 8.1) as the best substrates, respectively, and two specific enzymes, S-formylglutathione hydrolase (pI = 5.2) and S-succinylglutathione hydrolase (pI = 9.0). Isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gel resolved nine unspecific glutathione thiol esterase bands (between pH values 7.0 and 8.4). Partially purified glyoxalase II (S-2-hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase, EC 3.1.2.6) from erythrocytes or liver still gave three components on electrophoresis and several activity bands on gel electrofocusing. These results indicate that human red cells contain at least four separate glutathione thiol esterases. Glyoxalase II, one of these enzymes, apparently occurs in multiple forms. These were neither influenced by preptreatment of the samples with neuraminidase or thiols nor were interconvertible during the fractionations.	eng	277	288	Biochimica et biophysica acta	580	2	1979	Oct	24	D004591;D004912/Q000201;D005978/Q000031;D006801;D007525;D008722;D013194;D013869/Q000097	Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glutathione/analogs & derivatives;Humans;Isoelectric Focusing;Methods;Staining and Labeling;Thiolester Hydrolases/blood	Uotila L	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True

Both 2-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol were used as substrates for the enzyme. The pH optimum of the reaction was approximately 9.0 when glycine NaOH was used as a buffer. The apparent Michaelis-Menten (KM) value for the methyl donor for the reaction, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, was 43 mumol/l. Human RBC TMT activity was neither activated nor inhibited by Ca2+, Mg2+, or tropolone, but the enzyme was inhibited by SKF 525A and by reagents that react with sulfhydryl groups. The mean TMT activity in blood from 289 randomly selected adult white subjects was 10.93 +/- 3.22 units per mg protein (mean +/- S.D.). The activity was the same in samples from men and women. The results of experiments in which TMT activity was measured in mextures of RBC membranes with relatively ""low"" and relatively ""high"" activities provided no evidence that individual variations in the enzyme activity were due to variations in endogenous TMT activators or inhibitors."	eng	59	71	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	97	1	1979	Sep	15	D002851;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008780/Q000037;D008780/Q000097;D012436;D013438/Q000378;D013439/Q000494	Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors;Methyltransferases/blood;S-Adenosylmethionine;Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism;Sulfhydryl Reagents/pharmacology	Weinshilboum RM;Sladek S;Klumpp S	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
222	6106548	Regulation of gamma-glutamylcysteine utilization in erythrocytes.	Glutathione is synthesized from gamma-glutamylcysteine and glycine via the action of glutathione synthetase. It is known that gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase is present in many cells and may convert gamma-glutamylcysteine to 5-oxoproline and cysteine, but until now there has not been a credible explanation for the apparent suppression of the gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase reaction during glutathione synthesis. Our data suggest that the gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase and glutathione synthetase pathways are regulated by a simple kinetic mechanism that favors the synthesis of glutathione.	eng	236	240	Enzyme	25	4	1980			D003545/Q000031;D003545/Q000097;D004151/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D005971/Q000097;D005981/Q000097;D006801;D007700;D005722/Q000097	Cysteine/analogs & derivatives;Cysteine/blood;Dipeptides/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glutamates/blood;Glutathione Synthase/blood;Humans;Kinetics;gamma-Glutamylcyclotransferase/blood	Smith JE;Moore K;Board PG	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
223	6773534	ABH and Lewis glycosyltransferases in human red cells, lymphocytes and platelets.	The alpha-O-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-, alpha-3-D-galactosyl- and alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases, the direct products of the respective A, B and H blood group genes have been identified in red cells, lymphocytes and platelets homogenates from secretor and non-secretor individuals of appropriate ABO group. The H enzyme was not detectable in red cell membranes from Bombay individuals. Since the uptake of A antigen from the plasma has been shown at least for red cells [10] and lymphocytes [25], the present results suggest that the ABH determinants of the blood cells may arise both from intrinsic and extrinsic origin, but the relative contribution of each mechanism is not known. In contrast, the Lewis enzyme was absent or inactive in all the investigated blood cell samples, which can be considered as an additional proof that the Lewis antigens of these cells are entirely derived from the plasma.	eng	271	282	Revue francaise de transfusion et immuno-hematologie	23	3	1980			D000017;D001792/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D005647/Q000097;D005700/Q000097;D006602/Q000097;D006801;D007983;D008214/Q000201	ABO Blood-Group System;Blood Platelets/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Fucosyltransferases/blood;Galactosyltransferases/blood;Hexosyltransferases/blood;Humans;Lewis Blood Group Antigens;Lymphocytes/enzymology	Cartron JP;Mulet C;Bauvois B;Rahuel C;Salmon C	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True
224	7211065	Creatine transport into red blood cells.	The permeation of creatine from plasma into normal human red blood cells was investigated by means of 1-[14C]-creatine. Two statistically different Vmax and Km values were found for lower and for higher creatine concentrations of the plasma, respectively, indicating two types of transport with different affinities and capacities. It is suggested that the high affinity process, which accounts for 1/4 of the capacity and has an affinity constant of 0.087 +/- 0.032 mM is an active transport, while the low affinity transport represents an exchange diffusion. There is little, if any, effect of pH in the range of 6.9-7.9 on the transport. The total creatine concentration of the red cells did not change significantly even with high creatine concentration of the plasma during 6 h incubation at 37 degrees C. The in vitro experiments showed a daily exchange of cellular creatine of 20%, the t0.5 being about 2.5 days.	eng	771	779	Acta biologica et medica Germanica	39	7	1980			D000328;D001693;D003401/Q000097;D004058;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D010949/Q000378;D013696	Adult;Biological Transport, Active;Creatine/blood;Diffusion;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Plasma/metabolism;Temperature	Syllm-Rapoport I;Daniel A;Rapoport S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
225		Partial Purification of D-Xylulokinase in Human Erythrocyes	D-xylulokinase [EC 2. 7. 1. 17] was partialy purified from about 1 liter of acid-citrate-dixtrose (ACD) blood. A large portion of hemoglobin was removed by treatment with DEAE-cellulose, and then enzyme was purified by ammonium phosphate precipitation, calcium phosphate gel treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAF-cellulose column chromatography and the sephadex G-200 gel filtration. Four peaks were obtained by eluting with a linear gradient system of KCl concentration with the DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. It seemed that the peak I was hemoglobin and the peak IV was D-xylulokinase. D-xylulokinase was purified 2, 000-fold yielding 9.7mg. Its specific activity was 3 units per mg protein. The molecular weight of the peak IV was about 260, 000 as estimated by sephadex G-200 gel column chromatography. In the phospharylation of D-xylulose by this enzyme, pentose 5-phosphates were produced. Analysis of the reaction product indicate that the main component of the product was xylulose 5-pyosphate. Thus, the present study confirms the postulation that D-xylulose is first phosphorylated by xylulokinase and then metabolized through pentose phosphate pathway to lactic acid		361	369	Journal of the Japan Society of Blood Transfusion	26	6	1980					Watanabe S, Yoshikawa H	Journal, Article					10.3925/jjtc1958.26.361		Erythro	True
226	7354809	Increased sodium-lithium countertransport in red cells of patients with essential hypertension.	This paper describes experiments showing that one of the pathways of sodium transport across the red-cell membrane, sodium-lithium countertransport, is faster in patients with essential hypertension than in control subjects. This transport system accepts only sodium or lithium and is not inhibited by ouabain. The maximum rate of transport shows inherited differences. The mean maximum rate of sodium-lithium countertransport was found to be 0.55 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- S.E.M.) mmol (liter of red cells X hour)(-1) in a group of 36 patients with essential hypertension and 0.24 +/- 0.02 in 26 control subjects (P less than 0.001). The first-degree relatives of eight patients with essential hypertension and 10 control subjects had mean maximum rates of sodium-lithium countertransport of 0.54 +/- 0.05 and 0.23 +/- 0.02, respectively. Five patients with secondary hypertension had normal mean maximum rates of sodium-lithium countertransport. The relation between heritability of red-cell sodium-lithium countertransport and essential hypertension should be investigated further.	eng	772	776	The New England journal of medicine	302	14	1980	Apr	03	D001692;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D006973/Q000097;D066298;D008094/Q000097;D008297;D011188/Q000097;D012964/Q000097;D014882	Biological Transport;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Hypertension/blood;In Vitro Techniques;Lithium/blood;Male;Potassium/blood;Sodium/blood;Water-Electrolyte Balance	Canessa M;Adragna N;Solomon HS;Connolly TM;Tosteson DC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True
227	7440566	Stopped flow studies on the nonenzymatic reduction of methemoglobin by reduced flavin mononucleotide.	The nonenzymatic reduction of methemoglobin by the reduced form of flavin mononucleotide was studied under various conditions by following the reaction with a stopped flow apparatus. The reaction was very fast, compared with the reduction of the flavin by NADPH-flavin reductase of human erythrocytes, and followed a second order rate law: the rate constant (K) for the reduction of methemoglobin by reduced flavin mononucleotide was determined to be 5.5 X 10(6) M-1 S-1 in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 25 degrees C. The reaction was not influenced by changing phosphate buffer concentration from 10 to 100 mM. The rate of reduction at the physiological pH, 7.0, was about 95% of the maximal value that observed at around pH 6.4. Formation of deoxyhemoglobin and oxidized form of flavin mononucleotide by the reaction proceeded stoichiometrically in a ratio of unity. These results apparently indicate that the limiting step for the reduction of methemoglobin by the NADPH-flavin reductase system in human erythrocytes is the enzymatic reduction of flavin.	eng	11694	11697	The Journal of biological chemistry	255	24	1980	Dec	25	D005486;D006454;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008706/Q000378;D010084;D013053	Flavin Mononucleotide;Hemoglobins;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Methemoglobin/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Spectrophotometry	Yubisui T;Matsukawa S;Yoneyama Y	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
228	7440576	Transport and accumulation of pyridoxine and pyridoxal by erythrocytes.	The mechanisms of transport of pyridoxine (PN) and pyridoxal (PL) into erythrocytes have been investigated using the rapid-mixing technique with 3H-labeled substrates. Erythrocytes take up PN by passive diffusion as indicated by the fact that the initial influx process is nonsaturable and is not affected by pyridoxamine (PM), PL, or 4'-deoxypyridoxine. Transport of PL has the same characteristics. The transport of both PN and PL is temperature-dependent with a sharp increase in rate of uptake between 15 and 20 degrees C. The accumulation of 3H from [3H]PN against a concentration gradient was the result of phosphorylation. When the phosphorylation of [3H]PN was reduced by adding 160 microM unlabeled PN, PL, PM, or 4'-deoxypyridoxine, the cell:medium concentration ratio for 3H did not exceed unity. In contrast, with [3H]PL, 1.6 mM concentrations of these unlabeled substrates did not reduce the cell:medium concentration ratio of 3H. This kinase-in-dependent accumulation of PL against a concentration gradient, in the absence of evidence for mediated transport, suggested that binding by an intracellular protein was responsible. Evidence for such binding was obtained from Sephadex G-75 gel filtration, ultrafiltration, and equilibrium dialysis studies with [3H]PL. Reduction of the PL x protein complex with NaBH4 resulted in a stable pyridoxyl protein. The high binding capacity and the molecular weight by gel filtration suggest that hemoglobin is the binding protein.	eng	11901	11907	The Journal of biological chemistry	255	24	1980	Dec	25	D000818;D001692/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008297;D011730/Q000097;D011736/Q000031;D011736/Q000097;D011736/Q000494;D051381	Animals;Biological Transport/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Male;Pyridoxal/blood;Pyridoxine/analogs & derivatives;Pyridoxine/blood;Pyridoxine/pharmacology;Rats	Mehansho H;Henderson LM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

230	7387617	Characterization of the subunit composition of HGPRTase from human erythrocytes and cultured fibroblasts.	Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase is a ubiquitous human enzyme, the inherited deficiency of which leads to a specific metabolic-neurological syndrome. Native acrylamide isoelectric focusing revealed that the human enzyme consists of different numbers of isoenzymes depending on the tissue of origin. The erythrocytic enzyme has the most isoenzymes while the enzyme from cultured fibroblasts has only a single isoenzyme. The isoenzyme pattern of the erythrocytic enzyme changes on storage of the crude hemolysate at 4 C. Treatment of the stored crude hemolysate with 4.5 M urea and 0.35 mM beta-mercaptoethanol results in an isoenzyme pattern similar to that of the fresh crude extract. Thus the additional isoenzymes are generated on storage not by covalent modification of the enzyme but probably by binding of small molecules to the enzyme or to association of the enzyme molecules. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase has been purified to 80% homogeneity in three steps, DEAE Sephadex chromatography, heat treatment at 85 C for 5 min, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. Denaturing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the erythrocytic enzyme revealed that the erythrocytic enzyme is composed of three major types of subunits (1-3) with the same molecular weight but different isoelectric points. In contrast, the fibroblast enzyme is composed of only a single type of subunit, which comigrates with subunit 1 of the erythrocytic enzyme. Since there is a single genetic locus in humans for HGPRTase (the enzyme is X linked) (Nyhan et al., 1967), the observed subunit modification of the erythrocyte enzyme appears to be the result of posttranslational modification. These findings provide a simple explanation for the observed electrophoretic properties of human HGPRTase. A patient with 0.5% of HGPRTase activity in his erythrocytes was found to have small amounts (greater than 0.5% but less than 5% of normal) of the erythrocytic HGPRTase subunits.	eng	1	19	Biochemical genetics	18	1-2	1980	Feb		D001345;D002852;D004591;D004792/Q000302;D004912/Q000201;D005347/Q000201;D006358;D006801;D007041/Q000302;D007525;D007527/Q000302;D008297	Autoradiography;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Enzyme Precursors/isolation & purification;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Fibroblasts/enzymology;Hot Temperature;Humans;Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/isolation & purification;Isoelectric Focusing;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Male	Zannis VI;Gudas LJ;Martin DW	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
231	6444721	Isozymes of human phosphofructokinase: identification and subunit structural characterization of a new system.	The existence of a five-membered isozyme system for human phosphofructokinase (PFK; ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) has been demonstrated. These multimolecular forms result from the random polymerization of two distinct subunits, M (muscle type) and L (liver type), to form all possible tetrameters-i.e., M(4), M(3)L, M(2)L(2), ML(3), and L(4). Partially purified muscle and liver PFKs were hybridized by dissociation at low pH and then recombination at neutrality. Three hybrid species were generated in addition to the two parental isozymes, to yield an entire five-membered set. The various species could be consistently and reproducibly separated from one another by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography at pH 8.0 with a concave elution gradient of salt. Under similar experimental conditions, erythrocyte PFK from hemolysates was also resolved into five species chromatographically indistinguishable from those produced in the above experiment. Immunological and kinetic studies of the isozymes provided corroborative evidence to support the proposed subunit structures. Erythrocyte PFK was found to have kinetic properties intermediate between those of muscle and liver PFK and was neutralized only 50% by an antiserum against muscle PFK that completely neutralized muscle PFK. These data demonstrate that muscle and liver PFKs are distinct homotetramers-i.e., M(4) and L(4), respectively-whereas erythrocyte PFK is a heterogeneous mixture of all five isozymes. The structural heterogeneity of erythrocyte PFK provides a molecular genetic basis for the differential organ involvement observed in some inherited PFK deficiency states in which myopathy or hemolysis or both can occur.	eng	62	66	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	77	1	1980	Jan		D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007527/Q000276;D007527/Q000302;D007527/Q000378;D007700;D008099/Q000201;D046911;D009132/Q000201;D010732/Q000276;D010732/Q000302;D010732/Q000378	Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Isoenzymes/immunology;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Kinetics;Liver/enzymology;Macromolecular Substances;Muscles/enzymology;Phosphofructokinase-1/immunology;Phosphofructokinase-1/isolation & purification;Phosphofructokinase-1/metabolism	Vora S;Seaman C;Durham S;Piomelli S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
232	7397170	Creatine and creatinine transport in old and young human red blood cells.	The time course of creatine influx or efflux as measured in populations of red cells or red cell ghosts with normal age distribution does not follow simple two-compartment kinetics. This suggests that the contributions of individual cells to transport as measured in the populations as a whole are not uniform. In agreement with this inference, fractionation of red cell populations with respect to cell age shows that transport in young cells is considerably faster than in old cells. The dependence of creatine transport on creatine concentration in the medium follows an equation that can be interpreted to represent a super-imposition of a saturable component (apparent Km = 0.02 mM) and another component that cannot be saturated up to a creatine concentration of 5.0 mM. In contrast to the non-saturable component, the saturable component depends on the energy metabolism of the cell and can be inhibited by beta-guanidinopropionic acid and the proteolytic enzyme pronase. This latter finding suggests that the saturable component represents active transport that is mediated by a transport protein. The non-saturable component is little, if at all, dependent on cell age while the saturable component is higher in young cells than in old cells. Phloretin inhibits both components of creatine flux, but the maximal inhibition that can be achieved at high concentration is only 70--80%. Under the experimental conditions used for the study of creatine transport, creatinine equilibration between cells and medium follows the kinetics expected for a steady-state two-compartment system. Creatinine flux is proportional to creatine concentration over the concentration range studied (up to 5 mM). It cannot be inhibited by beta-guanidinopropionic acid or pronase.	eng	212	227	Biochimica et biophysica acta	600	1	1980	Jul	16	D001692/Q000187;D001693/Q000187;D003401/Q000378;D003401/Q000494;D003404/Q000378;D004305;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D010693/Q000494;D013997	Biological Transport/drug effects;Biological Transport, Active/drug effects;Creatine/metabolism;Creatine/pharmacology;Creatinine/metabolism;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Phloretin/pharmacology;Time Factors	Ku CP;Passow H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
233	6995852	Evidence for two insulin receptor populations on human erythrocytes.	Human erythrocytes specifically bind 125I-insulin in a manner similar to cells in which insulin exerts a physiological response. In addition, erythrocytes are of practical value for correlating in vitro insulin binding with in vivo carbohydrate intolerance. The competitive binding of labelled and unlabelled insulin to erythrocyte receptor3 is typically curvilinear when plotted according to Scatchard. The curvilinear nature of the Scatchard plot describing insulin binding to membrane receptors, although originally attributed to heterogeneous sites, has been more recently interpreted as negative cooperativity between homogenous sites. Evidence reported here, however, suggests that there are two populations of insulin receptors on erythrocytes. Specific concentrations of concanavalin A (Con A), a lectin which mimics insulin activity, are shown here to inhibit one population of receptors leaving another population unaffected.	eng	279	281	Nature	286	5770	1980	Jul	17	D001667;D003208/Q000378;D003208/Q000494;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007328/Q000378;D007700;D011972/Q000187;D011972/Q000378	Binding, Competitive;Concanavalin A/metabolism;Concanavalin A/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Insulin/metabolism;Kinetics;Receptor, Insulin/drug effects;Receptor, Insulin/metabolism	Herzberg V;Boughter JM;Carlisle S;Hill DE	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
234	7400118	Reduction of methemoglobin through flavin at the physiological concentration by NADPH-flavin reductase of human erythrocytes.	The reduction of methemoglobin by NADPH-flavin reductase of human erythrocytes through flavin was studied under various conditions using a reconstituted methemoglobin reductase system. The reduction of methemoglobin by the reconstituted enzyme system could be easily detected with flavin at the physiological concentration (e.g., 0.1-1.0 microM), and the rates obtained with 0.1 and 1.0 microM FMN were 0.19 and 2.2 nmol heme reduced per min per ml, respectively, in the absence of oxygen. FMN was more effective than FAD in reduction by the reconstituted enzyme system, and oxygen decreased the rate of the reduction. The reduction of methemoglobin by the reconstituted enzyme system with flavin at a physiological concentration proceeded as a zero order reaction. These results apparently suggest that the NADPH-flavin reductase system is able to reduce methemoglobin in erythrocytes at a moderate speed with about 1 microM flavin, and the reduction was estimated to vary from less than 1% to about 20% of that by the NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase system with 1 microM cytochrome b5, depending on the uptake of flavin by human erythrocytes.	eng	1715	1720	Journal of biochemistry	87	6	1980	Jun		D042966/Q000097;D004912/Q000201;D038181;D005486;D005182;D006801;D007700;D008706;D009247/Q000097;D010084	Cytochrome-B(5) Reductase/blood;Erythrocytes/enzymology;FMN Reductase;Flavin Mononucleotide;Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide;Humans;Kinetics;Methemoglobin;NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/blood;Oxidation-Reduction	Yubisui T;Takeshita M;Yoneyama Y	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
235	7448195	Pyridoxine (pyridoxamine) phosphate oxidase activity in the red cell.	A method has been developed for the measurement of red cell pyridoxine (pyridoxamine) phosphate oxidase activity. The more stable substrate, pyridoxamine phosphate, was incubated with a red cell haemolysate and the product pyridoxal phosphate was measured by Lactobacillus casei microbiological assay. A wide range of oxidase activities was found in control subjects (6-136 ng pyridoxal phosphate/g Hb x 10(-2)). There is a close correlation between the rate of conversion of pyridoxine to pyridoxal phosphate in whole blood and the oxidase activity. There was a marked increase in both after oral riboflavin. These results suggest that the oxidase plays a large part in the regulation of vitamin B-6 metabolism in red cells.	eng	401	409	Biochimica et biophysica acta	613	2	1980	Jun	13	D000328;D004912/Q000201;D006454;D006801;D006863;D008875;D000587/Q000097;D011734/Q000097;D011736/Q000097;D012256/Q000494	Adult;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Hemoglobins;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Middle Aged;Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/blood;Pyridoxaminephosphate Oxidase/blood;Pyridoxine/blood;Riboflavin/pharmacology	Clements JE;Anderson BB	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True

The uptake of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and stimulation of membrane-associated protein kinase in mature human erythrocytes were investigated. cAMP transport across the membrane was temperature dependent, and cAMP binding to the isolated membrane had less temperature dependence. More than 99% of the [3H]-cAMP taken up by erythrocytes was nonmembrane bound. Maximal stimulation of membrane protein kinase and maximal occupancy of membrane cAMP binding sites by extracellular cAMP cccurred at 30 degrees C within 30 min after initiation of the incubation of erythrocytes with cAMP. The concentration of extracellular cAMP that gave half-maximal stimulation of membrane protein kinase was 5.4 X 10-4 M, a value consistent with the concentrations of cAMP (5.2 X 10-4 M) found to occupy half-maximally the membrane cAMP binding sites in erythrocytes. Extracellular cAMP and to a lesser extent guanosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate and inosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate stimulated membrane protein kinase in erythrocytes. The cAMP uptake by human erythrocytes as well as cAMP binding to membranes in the erythrocyte was blocked by an inhibitor [4,4'-bis(isothiocyano)stilbene-2,2-disulfonate] of the anion channel. These studies indicate that cAMP can be transported across membranes into human erythrocytes and can bind to membranes to activate membrane protein kinase. It appears that there is a shared transport channel for cAMP and anion transport.	eng	918	924	Biochemistry	19	5	1980	Mar	04	D017878;D012856/Q000031;D012856/Q000494;D000328;D001692;D000242/Q000097;D000242/Q000494;D003571/Q000494;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008297;D011494/Q000097	4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid;4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/analogs & derivatives;4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/pharmacology;Adult;Biological Transport;Cyclic AMP/blood;Cyclic AMP/pharmacology;Cytochalasin B/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Male;Protein Kinases/blood	Tsukamoto T;Suyama K;Germann P;Sonenberg M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Staining procedures are described for the detection after starch-gel electrophoresis of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) and ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase (RPE). 2. Both RPI and RPE were detected in all human tissues including red cells, lymphocytes and fibroblasts. 3. No evidence was found for more than one structural gene locus for either enzyme. 4. No allelic variants of either enzyme were found in erythrocyte lysates from over 200 unrelated individuals. 5. Preliminary data are presented which suggest that differences in tissue RPE isozyme patterns may be due to endogenous proteolytic activity. 6. Electrophoretic analysis of RPE and RPI isozyme patterns in extracts of man/mouse hybrid cells indicates that RPE is probably a dimer and RPI may also be polymeric.	eng	335	342	Annals of human genetics	43	4	1980	May		D000818;D002238/Q000235;D004592;D005796;D014644;D006801;D051379;D012267/Q000378;D012274/Q000378	Animals;Carbohydrate Epimerases/genetics;Electrophoresis, Starch Gel;Genes;Genetic Variation;Humans;Mice;Ribosemonophosphates/metabolism;Ribulosephosphates/metabolism	Spencer N;Hopkinson DA	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte;red cell	True
239	7406436	Human brain aldolase C4 isoenzyme: purification, radioimmunoassay, and distribution in human tissues.	The nervous system specific isoenzyme of frustose-1, 6-diphosphate aldolase (E.C.4.1.2.13), aldolase C4, has been purified from human brain, and a sensitive radioimmunoassay has been developed for its detection. This assay is also capable of detecting other hybrid isoenzymes containing the C subunit but not the A4 isoenzyme. A systematic survey of human organs has shown that immunoreactive aldolase C is present in all human organs but at levels less than 2% of those found in human brain; especially low levels occur in kidney, skeletal muscle, lung, and thyroid tissue. The presence of aldolase C in other organs apart from nervous tissue is unlikely to be explicable by innervation alone since significant quantities are found in erythrocytes. The high degrees of localisation of aldolase C4 in nervous tissue makes it a suitable marker for cell damage within the central nervous system.	eng	114	121	Annals of clinical biochemistry	17	3	1980	May		D001921/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D005634/Q000032;D005634/Q000097;D005634/Q000302;D006801;D007527/Q000032;D007527/Q000302;D008970;D011863;D014018	Brain/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase/analysis;Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase/blood;Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase/isolation & purification;Humans;Isoenzymes/analysis;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Molecular Weight;Radioimmunoassay;Tissue Distribution	Willson VJ;Thompson RJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
240	6770891	Some sulfhydryl properties and primary structure of human erythrocyte superoxide dismutase.	Human Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase prepared by different methods shows varying properties relevant to its sulfhydryl chemistry. A cysteine residue not found in the analogous bovine enzyme appears to be responsible for its unusual lability. Alkylation of this cysteine results in a marked increase in stability, and this form of the protein may be readily crystallized. The primary structure of the 153 amino acid residues found in the human protein has been determined, and 82% of the residues are identical with those of the bovine enzyme. A significant variation is seen in the portion of those proteins comprising residues 17-36, with eleven changes being noted.	eng	2310	2316	Biochemistry	19	11	1980	May	27	D000595;D002918;D003460;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D010434;D010446/Q000032;D010447;D013482/Q000097;D014357	Amino Acid Sequence;Chymotrypsin;Crystallization;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Pepsin A;Peptide Fragments/analysis;Peptide Hydrolases;Superoxide Dismutase/blood;Trypsin	Jabusch JR;Farb DL;Kerschensteiner DA;Deutsch HF	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

242	6934695	Population genetics of red cell enzymes in Pygmies: a conclusive account.	In the course of a long-term research project, three groups of Pygmies and some non-Pygmy Central Africans have been examined for the following red cell enzyme markers: ACP, PGM1, PGM2, PEPA, PEPB, and PEPC, AK, ADA, and PHI. Several other red cell enzymes (ESD, CA1 and CA2, GPT, GLO, and DIA1) have been studied in only some of these groups. This paper reports all the information we obtained, including what we have already published. The following conclusions can be drawn from the whole body of data: (1) Gene patterns of Pygmies are those typical of other Africans (e.g.: lack of ADA2 and AK2 genes, low GPT2 gene frequency, polymorphism of the CA2 locus, and presence at polymorphic frequencies of PEPA2 allele. (2) Superimposed on this African genetic makeup, a number of Pygmy characters were identified, namely, a private polymorphism for the PGM26 Pygmy allele and possibly one for the PEPC2 allele, and particularly high ACPR and low PGM12 gene frequencies. (3) Some markers, especially PGM1 and ACP, turned out also to discriminate efficiently among different groups of Pygmies.	eng	934	954	American journal of human genetics	32	6	1980	Nov		D044383;D002163;D002488;D015023;D004912/Q000201;D005006;D005787;D005819;D006801;D011110	Black People;Cameroon;Central African Republic;Democratic Republic of the Congo;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Ethnicity;Gene Frequency;Genetic Markers;Humans;Polymorphism, Genetic	Santachiara-Benerecetti AS;Beretta M;Negri M;Ranzani G;Antonini G;Barberio C;Modiano G;Cavalli-Sforza LL	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True

244	6258579	Partial purification and characterization of human erythrocyte phosphoglycollate phosphatase.	Human erythrocytes contain a phosphatase that is highly specific for phosphoglycollate. It shows optimum pH of 6.7 and has Km 1 mM for phosphoglycollate. The molecular weight appears to be about 72000. The enzyme is a dimeric molecule having subunits of mol. wt. about 35000. It could be purified approx. 4000-fold up to a specific activity of 5.98 units/mg of protein. The activity of the enzyme is Mg2+-dependent. Co2+, and to a smaller extent Mn2+, may substitute for Mg2+. Half-maximum inhibition of the phosphatase by 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate), EDTA and NaF is obtained at 0.5 microM, 1 mM and 4 mM respectively. Moreover, it needs a univalent cation for optimum activity. Phosphoglycollate phosphatase is a cytoplasmic enzyme. Approx. 5% of its total activity is membrane-associated. This part of activity can be approx. 70% solubilized by freezing, thawing and treatment with 0.25% Triton X-100.	eng	117	124	The Biochemical journal	191	1	1980	Oct	01	D000838/Q000494;D002413/Q000494;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D010744/Q000037;D010744/Q000097;D010744/Q000302;D012995;D013379	Anions/pharmacology;Cations, Divalent/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/blood;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/isolation & purification;Solubility;Substrate Specificity	Zecher R;Wolf HU	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

246	7002549	Identification of proteolytic activities in the cytosolic compartment of mature human erythrocytes.	Individual lysates from human erythrocyte suspensions, completely deprived of leucocytes and were assayed for a number of proteolytic activities using both naturally occurring and synthetic substrates. Removal of hemoglobin by batchwise DEAE-cellulose chromatography did not modify the complement of the various proteolytic activities which were then fractionated by means of chromatography on a column of DEAE-cellulose, followed by conventional techniques such as gel chromatography and preparative electrophoresis. This procedure allowed a number of proteinases to be identified in the erythrocyte cytosol while providing a tool for their selective though partial separation. The following peptidases were found to be present in the soluble fraction of mature human erythrocytes: (a) a neutral endopeptidase having an approximate molecular weight of 110 000; (b) three acidic endopeptidases, with pH optima between 2.5 and 3.5, showing molecular and functional properties almost identical with those of the three proteinases previously purified from solubilized erythrocyte membranes [Pontremoli et al. (1979) Biochem. J. 181, 559--568]; (c) two dipeptidylaminopeptidases whose molecular weights are around 80 000 and tentatively identified as dipeptidyl aminopeptidases II and III, respectively, on the basis of their substrate specificities and pH optima; (d) presumably two aminopeptidases, having an approximate molecular weight of 80 000 and classified as an aminopeptidase with broad substrate specificity and an aminopeptidase B, respectively. No evidence for any carboxypeptidase activity was found in the cytosolic compartment of mature human erythrocytes.	eng	421	430	European journal of biochemistry	110	2	1980	Sep		D002413;D003600/Q000201;D004150/Q000097;D010450/Q000097;D010450/Q000302;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D010447/Q000097;D010447/Q000302;D013379	Cations, Divalent;Cytosol/enzymology;Dipeptidases/blood;Endopeptidases/blood;Endopeptidases/isolation & purification;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Peptide Hydrolases/blood;Peptide Hydrolases/isolation & purification;Substrate Specificity	Pontremoli S;Melloni E;Salamino F;Sparatore B;Michetti M;Benatti U;Morelli A;De Flora A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
247	7191632	Mercaptopurine pharmacogenetics: monogenic inheritance of erythrocyte thiopurine methyltransferase activity.	Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyzes thiopurine S-methylation, an important metabolic pathway for drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine. Erythrocyte (RBC) TPMT activity was measured in blood samples from 298 randomly selected subjects. Of the subjects, 88.6% were included in a subgroup with high enzyme activity (13.50 +/- 1.86 U, mean +/- SD), 11.1% were included in a subgroup with intermediate activity (7.20 +/- 1.08 U), and 0.3% had undetectable activity. This distribution conforms to Hardy-Weinberg predictions for the autosomal codominant inheritance of a pair of alleles for low and high TPMT activity, TPMT(L) and TPMT(H), with gene frequencies of .059 and .941, respectively. If RBC TPMT activity is inherited in an autosomal codominant fashion, then subjects homozygous for TPMT(H) would have high enzyme activity, subjects heterozygous for the two alleles would have intermediate activity, and subjects homozygous for TPMT(L) would have undetectable activity. The segregation of RBC TPMT activity among 215 first-degree relatives in 50 randomly selected families and among 35 members of two kindreds and one family selected because they included probands with undetectable RBC enzyme activity were also compatible with the autosomal codominant inheritance of RBC TPMT. For example, in eight matings between subjects with intermediate activity (presumed genotype TPMT(L)TPMT(H)) and subjects with high activity (presumed genotype TPMT(H)TPMT(H)), 47% (8/17) of the offspring had intermediate activity. This value is very similar to the 50% figure expected on the basis of autosomal codominant inheritance (chi(2) ([1]) = .059). Further experiments are required to determine whether this genetic polymorphism for an important drug metabolizing enzyme may represent one factor in individual variations in sensitivity to thiopurines.	eng	651	662	American journal of human genetics	32	5	1980	Sep		D000328;D000483;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D005799;D006801;D008297;D015122/Q000378;D008780/Q000172;D008780/Q000235;D010375	Adult;Alleles;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Genes, Dominant;Humans;Male;Mercaptopurine/metabolism;Methyltransferases/deficiency;Methyltransferases/genetics;Pedigree	Weinshilboum RM;Sladek SL	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
248	6109287	Amino acid transport in human and in sheep erythrocytes.	Amino acid transport was compared in human and in sheep erythrocytes. Kinetic studies established that human cells have three discrete amino acid transport systems, designated L, Ly+ and ASC. The L system is partially stereospecific, with a preference for large neutral amino acids. L-leucine has a threefold lower apparent Km and a twofold smaller Vmax than D-leucine. Alanine, cysteine and possibly dibasic amino acids are transported by this route, but with a low affinity. The Ly+ system is highly stereoselective, and specific for dibasic amino acids, including arginine. The ASC system is Na-dependent and selective for neutral amino acids of intermediate size. It has a particularly low apparent Km for cysteine and is stereospecific. Sheep erythrocytes lack these systems. Instead they possess an additional system (C system) responsible for the transport both of neutral and of dibasic amino acids, with cysteine as the optimal substrate. Although the substrate specificities of the human ASC and sheep C systems are similar, the sheep system does not require Na and has considerably higher apparent Km values. Dibasic amino acid transport (of lysine, but not of arginine) by the C system occurs with a low affinity.	eng	355	375	Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

The Ca2+-pumping ATPase has been purified in a functional form from human erythrocytes by calmodulin affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme has a specific activity at least 300-fold higher than the membrane bound enzyme. It consists of one major protein band of 140000 Dalton, and after reconstitution in liposomes it transports Ca2+ with an efficiency of at least 1 Ca2+/ATP. In the presence of calmodulin, the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+, and its specific activity, are greatly increased. Acidic phospholipids have an unexpected effect on the isolated enzyme: ATPase isolated or reconstituted in acidic phospholipids behaves as if calmodulin were present. Acidic phospholipids mimic the effect of calmodulin.	eng	437	442	Acta biologica et medica Germanica	40	4-5	1981			D017301;D002118/Q000494;D002135/Q000494;D000252/Q000097;D000252/Q000302;D002147/Q000494;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D010743/Q000494;D012519/Q000201	Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase;Calcium/pharmacology;Calcium-Binding Proteins/pharmacology;Calcium-Transporting ATPases/blood;Calcium-Transporting ATPases/isolation & purification;Calmodulin/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Phospholipids/pharmacology;Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/enzymology	Niggli V;Carafoli E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

254	6894153	Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase in human erythrocytes.	Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase, which converts pyrroline-5-carboxylate to proline, has been identified in human erythrocytes. The level of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase activity in these cells is comparable to the activity levels of major erythrocyte enzymes. The physiologic function of the enzyme in erythrocytes cannot be related to its function in other tissues, i.e., producing proline for protein synthesis. We examined the kinetic properties of erythrocyte pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase and compared them to the properties of the enzyme from proliferating cultured human fibroblasts. We found that the kinetic properties and regulation of the erythrocyte enzyme are distinctly different from those for human fibroblast pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase. These characteristics are consistent with the interpretation that the function of the enzyme in human erythrocytes may be to generate oxidizing potential in the form of NADP+.	eng	1042	1046	The Journal of clinical investigation	67	4	1981	Apr		D000328;D004912/Q000201;D005246;D005347/Q000201;D006801;D009243/Q000097;D009249/Q000097;D000587/Q000097;D011762/Q000097;D012016	Adult;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Feedback;Fibroblasts/enzymology;Humans;NAD/blood;NADP/blood;Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/blood;Pyrroline Carboxylate Reductases/blood;Reference Values	Yeh GC;Harris SC;Phang JM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

256	7030366	Insulin degradation in human erythrocyte. Effects of reduced glutathione on insulin degradation by membrane fractions.	In this study the Authors have evaluated the effects of reduced glutathione on insulin-degrading activity of erythrocyte membrane fractions. The GSH increases, in a manner proportional to its concentration, the insulin degradation by intact membranes, solubilized proteins and membranes treated with Triton X-100. The net increase of degradation is greater for intact and extracted membranes than for solubilized proteins. These data suggest that in human erythrocyte membrane exists an enzymatic system GSH-dependent for insulin degradation and that this system is only partially solubilized by Triton X-100 treatment.	eng	1666	1672	Bollettino della Societa italiana di biologia sperimentale	57	16	1981	Aug	30	D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005978/Q000494;D006801;D007328/Q000097;D017830;D011092;D012995	Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glutathione/pharmacology;Humans;Insulin/blood;Octoxynol;Polyethylene Glycols;Solubility	Bellomo G;Nicotera PL;Fratino P	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
257	7339300	Studies on 5'-methylthioadenosine uptake by human erythrocytes.	The transport of 5'-methylthioadenosine across plasma membrane of human erythrocytes occurs by a carrier-mediated mechanism displaying a Km of congruent to 3 mM and a Vmax of congruent to 600 pmol/10(6) cells/min. Phosphate-depleted erythrocytes were employed to distinguish between 5'-methylthioadenosine transport and metabolic trapping. In phosphate medium, where 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase is operative, the uptake of radioactivity increases over the theoretical calculated equilibrium owing principally to conversion of the molecular into 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate. Newly developed HPLC techniques have been applied to analyze intracellular 5'-methylthioadenosine and its metabolites after exposure of the erythrocytes to [14C]-labelled 5'-methylthioadenosine.	eng	354	358	Medical biology	59	5-6	1981	Dec		D000241/Q000031;D000241/Q000097;D001693;D002851;D003839;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D010710/Q000097;D013872/Q000097	Adenosine/analogs & derivatives;Adenosine/blood;Biological Transport, Active;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Deoxyadenosines;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Phosphates/blood;Thionucleosides/blood	Zappia V;Della Ragione F;Porcelli M;Cacciapuoti G;Carteni-Farina M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
258	6119115	Specific localization of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase, (Ca2+/Mg2+)-ATPase, and acetylcholinesterase in human erythrocyte membrane.	A procedure was developed for the detection of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase in myelin. This assay was sufficiently to detect the low levels of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase in human erythrocytes. The 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase of human erythrocytes was determined to be exclusively associated with the inner (cytosolic) side of the membrane. Leaky ghosts and resealed ghosts were assayed for 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (Ca2+/Mg2+)-ATPase, and acetylcholinesterase activity, and the 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase profile is the same as that of the (Ca2+/Mg2+)-ATP, an established inner membrane marker.	eng	403	407	Biochimica et biophysica acta	678	3	1981	Dec	18	D015087/Q000378;D000110/Q000378;D017301;D000252/Q000378;D003600/Q000201;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D009186/Q000201;D010727/Q000378	2',3'-Cyclic-Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases/metabolism;Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism;Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase;Calcium-Transporting ATPases/metabolism;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Myelin Sheath/enzymology;Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/metabolism	Jones M;Keenan RW	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
259	6274404	Localization of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase in human erythrocyte membranes.	The location of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 2',3'-phosphodiesterase in human erythrocyte membranes was determined. This was accomplished by comparing the enzyme's accessibility with that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (cytoplasmic surface marker) and acetylcholinesterase (external marker) in sealed and unsealed ghosts and normal and inverted membrane vesicles. The results showed that 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, like glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, meets several criteria for an inner (cytoplasmic) membrane location: (1) the enzyme was accessible to substrate in unsealed ghosts and inside-out vesicles but not in sealed or right-side-out vesicles, (2) latent activity in sealed ghosts could be exposed with detergent (Triton X-100), (3) activity in unsealed ghosts was gradually sequestered during resealing and could be re-exposed with detergent, and (4) the enzyme was susceptible to trypsin proteolysis only in unsealed ghosts. These results demonstrate that the active site of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase faces the cytoplasm of erythrocytes and that the enzyme may not span the lipid bilayer of the membrane. The localization of the phosphodiesterase on the inner membrane surface of erythrocytes suggests that the similar enzyme of myelin may be embedded within the major dense line of the compact lamellae.	eng	587	594	Biochimica et biophysica acta	649	3	1981	Dec	21	D015087/Q000097;D000110/Q000097;D003902;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D005987/Q000097;D006801;D017830;D010727/Q000097;D011092	2',3'-Cyclic-Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases/blood;Acetylcholinesterase/blood;Detergents;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/blood;Humans;Octoxynol;Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/blood;Polyethylene Glycols	Dreiling CE	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
260	6797473	Human erythrocyte galactosyltransferase. Characterization, membrane association and sidedness of active site.	Human erythrocyte UDPgalactose : 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranosylpeptide galactose beta(1 lead to 3) transferase (Galactosyltransferase) has been characterized in terms of detergent and metal ion requirements. Michaelis constants for donor and acceptor substrates, inhibition constant for N-acetylgalactosamine, pH optimum and ionic strength effects. The assay thus optimized permits initial velocity measurements. Galactosyltransferase was shown to be membrane-bound by demonstrating its association with erythrocyte ghosts after high and low ionic strength treatments to remove weakly-associated proteins. In the absence of detergents, no activity was detectable in sealed ghosts and inside-out vesicles derived from erythrocyte membranes. Enzyme activation by detergents paralleled solubilization of membrane proteins. Both latency and solubilization studies indicated a substrate inaccessible active site for the enzyme in situ in the membrane. Galactosyltransferase activity in resealed ghosts, leaky ghosts and inside-out vesicles was resistant to the action of trypsin, chymotrypsin or pronase applied as single agents. A mixture of these proteases, however, strongly reduced the enzyme activity in inside-out vesicles and leaky ghosts, indicating a cytosolic orientation for the active site of the galactosyltransferase.	eng	709	716	Biochimica et biophysica acta	649	3	1981	Dec	21	D000116/Q000494;D001665;D002413;D003902/Q000494;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D005700/Q000097;D006801;D007700;D009994;D013696	Acetylgalactosamine/pharmacology;Binding Sites;Cations, Divalent;Detergents/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Galactosyltransferases/blood;Humans;Kinetics;Osmolar Concentration;Temperature	Hesford FJ;Berger EG	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
261	7448421	Genetic variation in the quantitative levels of an NADP (H)-binding protein (FX) in human erythrocytes.	"FX is a red cell NADP(H)-binding protein that has been well defined biochemically and immunologically but whose function is still unknown. Preliminary data indicated that the levels of this protein are significantly increased in hemizygotes, heterozygotes, and homozygotes for the G6PD Mediterranean mutant, thus raising the question of whether or not the individual variation in FX levels is more or less directly influenced by X-linked genes. The present study, based on a large series of population and family data collected in Sardinia, confirms unequivocally the above mentioned interaction, but shows at the same time that the variances in FX levels ""between sibships"" are 2-3 times larger than those ""within sibships,"" when the analysis is done separately for the G6PD-normal or the G6PD-deficient sibs. From the comparison of the interclass and intraclass correlation coefficients, it appears that about 60% of the total variation of FX is of genetic origin. Moreover, the FX levels of children, analyzed in a pairwise manner, were found to be more positively correlated with those of their fathers (r = 0.39) than with those of their maternal grandfathers (0.20). This latter finding obviously favors the conclusion that ""autosomal"" rather than ""X-linked"" genes are involved in the determination of the FX levels."	eng	209	217	Blood	57	2	1981	Feb		D000328;D000367;D001798/Q000235;D002238;D002352/Q000235;D002648;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D005796;D008040;D014644;D005954/Q000235;D005955/Q000235;D006801;D007658;D008297;D008433;D009249/Q000378;D012737;D013789/Q000235;D014960	Adult;Age Factors;Blood Proteins/genetics;Carbohydrate Epimerases;Carrier Proteins/genetics;Child;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Genes;Genetic Linkage;Genetic Variation;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/genetics;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency/genetics;Humans;Ketone Oxidoreductases;Male;Mathematics;NADP/metabolism;Sex Factors;Thalassemia/genetics;X Chromosome	Lenzerini L;Benatti U;Morelli A;Pontremoli S;De Flora A;Piazza A;Rinaldi A;Filippi G;Siniscalco M	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
262	7240371	Human erythrocyte monoester lipase: characterization and radiochemical assay of the cell-bound enzyme in normal subjects.	A monoester lipase (MEL) activity (EC 3.1.1.3) is described in human red blood cells (RBC). The lipase acts as a cell-bound enzyme and is able to exert its catalytic activity in vitro toward an exogenously added emulsified substrate. The enzyme activity, which appears to be confined to the cell membrane, is inhibited by Triton X-100. The MEL activity of human RBC is assayed using intact RBC as the enzyme source, with an emulsion of ethyl [3H]oleate (2 mM) as the substrate. The optimum pH for the reaction is 7.8 at 37 C. Lipolytic rates are monitored by quantitation of the amount of [3H]oleic acid released during 20 min of incubation after extraction by means of a liquid-liquid partition system. Suspensions of purified RBC obtained from 161 healthy adult subjects had a MEL activity of 1022 +/- 134 microunits/10(12) RBC (mean +/- SD), with a normal range (+/- 2 SD) between 754-1290 microunits. The individual activity values varied from 733-1490 microunits. The median of the 161 subjects was 1010 microunits/10(12) RB. There was no significant difference between the mean activities of RBC samples from men and women. MEL activity in RBC from the cord blood of 16 normal infants was found to be 43% higher than that in adults, with an average activity of 1458 +/- 174 microunits (mean +/- SD).	eng	143	148	The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism	53	1	1981	Jul		D000328;D002462/Q000201;D004355;D004912/Q000201;D005312/Q000201;D006801;D007231;D007700;D008049/Q000037;D008049/Q000097;D008875;D017830;D019301;D009829/Q000378;D011092/Q000494;D012016;D014316	Adult;Cell Membrane/enzymology;Drug Stability;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Fetal Blood/enzymology;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Kinetics;Lipase/antagonists & inhibitors;Lipase/blood;Middle Aged;Octoxynol;Oleic Acid;Oleic Acids/metabolism;Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology;Reference Values;Tritium	Boyer J;Somma C;Vérine A;L'Hôte C;Finidori J;Merger C;Arnaud J	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
263	7275011	N-Acetylalanine aminopeptidase, a new enzyme from human erythrocytes.	"A new enzyme liberating N-acetylalanine from N-acetylalanine peptides with high specificity has been isolated from the cytosol of human erythrocytes. The N-acetylalanine aminopeptidase was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation at 60% saturation, followed by chromatography on columns of Sephadex G-200, SP-Sephadex C-50, and DEAE-Sephadex A-50. About 2 000-fold enrichment was achieved from hemolyzed erythrocytes. The enzyme was homogeneous according to polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis and had a specific activity of 18.1 U/A280 unit. An apparent molecular weight of 300 000 +/- 15 000 was obtained from gel filtrations and was confirmed in the ultracentrifuge in ""an active enzyme centrifugation"" giving a corrected sedimentation value, s20w of 12 S. The pH optimum in triethanolamine/HCl buffer was around pH 8.3 with N-acetylalanine-4-nitroanilide as substrate, the Km was 0.616 mmol/l. The enzyme was stable between pH 6.0 to 8.0, but lost enzymic activity rapidly below pH 5 and with organic solvents. It is stabilized in a 0.1 M solution of ammonium sulfate. The activity was destroyed by high concentrations of chloromercuribenzoate and di(2-pyridyl)disulfide in an unspecific manner and could not be restored by cysteine. Various protein endoproteinase inhibitors are without influence on the enzymic activity. The enzyme exhibits an aminopeptidase-like activity with release of N-acetylalanine in order of decreasing activity from N-acetylalanine-4-nitroanilide, N-acetylalanyl-alanylalanine, N-acetylalanyl-tyrosyl-isoleucine, N-acetylalanylalanine, N-acetylalanyl-alanyl-alanylalanine, and N-acetylalanine ethyl ester. Several unacetylated peptides and alanine-4-nitroanilide as well as protein substrates were not hydrolyzed. The enzymic activity has not been found in the cytosolic compartment of highly purified human leucocytes.

264	6275838	The polyphosphoinositide phosphodiesterase of erythrocyte membranes.	1. A new assay procedure has been devised for measurement of the Ca(2+)-activated polyphosphoinositide phosphodiesterase (phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate phosphodiesterase) activity of erythrocyte ghosts. The ghosts are prepared from cells previously incubated with [(32)P]P(i). They are incubated under appropriate conditions for activation of the phosphodiesterase and the released (32)P-labelled inositol bisphosphate and inositol trisphosphate are separated by anion-exchange chromatography on small columns of Dowex-1 (formate form). When necessary, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate can be deacylated and the released phosphodiesters separated on the same columns. 2. The release of both inositol bisphosphate and inositol trisphosphate was rapid in human ghosts, with half of the labelled membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate broken down in only a few minutes in the presence of 0.5mm-Ca(2+). For both esters, optimum rates of release were seen at pH6.8-6.9. Mg(2+) did not provoke release of either ester. 3. Ca(2+) provoked rapid polyphosphoinositide breakdown in rabbit erythrocyte ghosts and a slower breakdown in rat ghosts. Erythrocyte ghosts from pig or ox showed no release of inositol phosphates when exposed to Ca(2+). 4. In the presence of Mg(2+), the inositol trisphosphate released from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was rapidly converted into inositol bisphosphate by phosphomonoesterase activity. 5. Neomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic that interacts with polyphosphoinositides, inhibited the breakdown of both phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, with the latter process being appreciably more sensitive to the drug. Phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride, an inhibitor of serine esterases that is said to inhibit phosphatidylinositol phosphodiesterase, had no effect on the activity of the erythrocyte polyphosphoinositide phosphodiesterase. 6. These observations are consistent with the notion that human, and probably rabbit and rat, erythrocyte membranes possess a single polyphosphoinositide phosphodiesterase that is activated by Ca(2+) and that attacks phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate with equal facility. Inhibition of this activity by neomycin seems likely to be due to interactions between neomycin and the polyphosphoinositides, with the greater inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate breakdown consistent with the greater affinity of the drug for this lipid. In addition, erythrocyte membranes possess Mg(2+)-dependent phosphomonoesterase that converts inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate into inositol bisphosphate.	eng	133	140	The Biochemical journal	198	1	1981	Jul	15	D000818;D002118/Q000494;D002852;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D066298;D007700;D008274/Q000494;D010726;D054801;D010727/Q000097;D010761;D013045	Animals;Calcium/pharmacology;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Magnesium/pharmacology;Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors;Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C;Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/blood;Phosphorus Radioisotopes;Species Specificity	Downes CP;Michell RH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
265	7240153	Properties of methemoglobin reductase and kinetic study of methemoglobin reduction.	A soluble erythrocyte cytochrome b5 was purified as the substrate of methemoglobin reductase and an electron carrier to methemoglobin. The isoelectric point of this protein was at pH 4.3, and E0' was -0.010 at pH 7.0.. The Km value of the enzyme for this protein was 1 x 10(-4) M, and the turnover number (k5) was 3.4 x 10(4) min-1, with NADH as an electron donor at pH 7.0. The optimum pH of the enzyme was pH 4.6 for ferricyanide and pH 5.5 for cytochrome b5, with a shoulder of activity at pH 7 to 9 for both substrates. The rate equation which represents the reduction of either methemoglobin or cytochrome c was obtained as a function of methemoglobin or cytochrome c, methemoglobin reductase, and cytochrome b5 by considering the E . S complex for both reductase and cytochrome b5, and the rate constants involved were determined. The rate constants between methemoglobin and reduced cytochrome b5 (k1, M-1 min-1) were 1.6 x 10(4), 3.1 x 10(6), and 4.1 x 10(6) at pH 7.0, pH 5.2, and pH 5.0, respectively.

266	6789880	Identification of the product formed by human erythrocyte galactosyltransferase.	Sepharose 4B-immobilized desialylated ovine submaxillary mucin was used as an acceptor for galactose transfer from UDP-galactose, catalyzed by a Triton X-100-solubilized galactosyltransferase from human erythrocyte ghosts. The product could be cleaved from the insoluble acceptor substrate by alkaline borohydride treatment and identified on Bio-Gel P-2 as a disaccharide. The nature of the glycosidic bond of the isolated material was elucidated by periodate oxidation/NaB[3H]4 reduction/acid hydrolysis and subsequent identification of the aminopolyol formed as L-threosaminitol. Specific cleavage of the enzymatic product by beta-galactosidase indicated a beta-configuration for incorporated galactose. These data permit classification of the enzyme as UDP-galactose: alpha-D-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-protein beta (1 leads to 3) transferase. Furthermore, in the presence of Triton X-100, the enzyme from normal erythrocytes catalyzed transfer of galactose to the glycan moieties of asialo-agalacto-glycophorin in Tn-erythrocytes from a patient with permanent mixed-field polyagglutinability.	eng	302	311	Biochimica et biophysica acta	659	2	1981	Jun	15	D001212;D002850;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D005690/Q000378;D005700/Q000097;D006801;D008345/Q000378;D009077/Q000378;D017830;D011092;D014531/Q000378	Asialoglycoproteins;Chromatography, Gel;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Galactose/metabolism;Galactosyltransferases/blood;Humans;Manganese/metabolism;Mucins/metabolism;Octoxynol;Polyethylene Glycols;Uridine Diphosphate Galactose/metabolism	Hesford FJ;Berger EG;Van den Eijnden DH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Major methylated membrane polypeptides were identified based on the comigration of radioactivity with Coomassie blue- and periodic acid-Schiff-staining species in pH 2.4 dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, as well as by the distribution of radiolabel and protein following selective proteolysis and membrane extraction procedures. Methylated species identified in this way include the cytoskeletal polypeptides band 2.1 (ankyrin) and band 4.1, as well as the band 3 anion transport protein. Other methylated species include an intrinsic polypeptide comigrating with band 3 but insensitive to external chymotrypsin digestion, a glycoprotein showing variable migration in this gel system (40,000-55,000 daltons), an intrinsic polypeptide at about 30,000 daltons, and an extrinsic species of about 17,000 daltons. A small amount of radioactivity comigrated with the band 4.5 region. Bands 1, 2, 4.2, 5, 6, 7, and the major sialoglycoprotein were not methylated in this system. All of the methylated species exhibited turnover in vivo, and the time taken to reach 50% demethylation for each species ranged from less than 2 to 29 h.	eng	6102	6108	The Journal of biological chemistry	256	12	1981	Jun	25	D002918;D004591;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008565/Q000097;D008715/Q000378;D008745;D008970;D010455/Q000378;D014357	Chymotrypsin;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Membrane Proteins/blood;Methionine/metabolism;Methylation;Molecular Weight;Peptides/metabolism;Trypsin	Freitag C;Clarke S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
268	6112873	Erythrocytic enzymes and amino acids related to glutamic acid metabolism in childhood hypoproteinemic states.	The erythrocyte enzymes of glutamic acid metabolism (glutaminase I, glutaminase II, glutamic acid decarboxylase, glutamine synthetase, and transaminases) and related amino acids (glutamine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid) were estimated in 69 children with protein-energy malnutrition, 13 with nephrosis, and 10 with Indian childhood cirrhosis. Twenty-one apparently healthy children served as controls. There was a significant increase in the activities of erythrocytic glutaminase I, glutaminase II, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and glutamine synthetase in all the three hypoproteinemic states, while the activities of the transaminases showed a decrease in all the conditions. The concentrations of all the amino acids were significantly increased in both the varieties of protein-energy malnutrition (edematous and nonedematous). In nephrosis and Indian childhood cirrhosis, aspartic acid, alanine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid showed a significant rise. The concentration of glutamic acid was also significantly increased in nephrosis. The observations of the present study suggest an increase in intracellular production of glutamic acid in hypoproteinemia.	eng	924	927	The American journal of clinical nutrition	34	5	1981	May		D000410/Q000097;D000596/Q000097;D001219/Q000097;D002675;D004912/Q000378;D005968/Q000097;D005974/Q000097;D005971/Q000097;D005972/Q000097;D006801;D007223;D008103/Q000097;D009401/Q000097;D011502/Q000097;D011506/Q000378	Alanine Transaminase/blood;Amino Acids/blood;Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood;Child, Preschool;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glutamate Decarboxylase/blood;Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/blood;Glutamates/blood;Glutaminase/blood;Humans;Infant;Liver Cirrhosis/blood;Nephrosis/blood;Protein-Energy Malnutrition/blood;Proteins/metabolism	Agarwal KN;Bhatia BD;Batta RK;Singla PN;Shankar R	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;Erythro;erythrocyte;erythro	True
269	7320944	Glycine transport in human erythrocytes.	1. Glycine transport in human erythrocytes was resolved into five separate components of uptake. The first and major component of uptake was transport by a high-affinity (apparent Km 25 microM) Na+- and Cl- -dependent system. This system was specific for glycine, sarcosine and proline; Br- but not I- was able to substitute for Cl-. Uptake by this route was inhibited less than 20% by the loop diuretics, bumetanide and furosemide (10(-4) M), suggesting that it was distinct from the Cl- -dependent system responsible for Na+/K+ transport. Its properties closely resembled those of the gly transport system described previously in avian erythrocytes. 2. The second uptake route was transport by the Na+-dependent, Cl- -independent small neutral amino acid transport system (designated ASC). Neither NA+-dependent uptake route was present in sheep erythrocytes. 3. Two Na+-independent uptake mechanisms were also identified; first, uptake by the amino acid transport system (designated L), and secondly, SITS-sensitive uptake by the anion-exchange (band 3) transport mechanism (SITS is 4-acetamido-4'-iso-thiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid, an effective inhibitor of anion transport by this route). Uptake by the latter route was increased markedly when fluxes were measured in isotonic SO42- medium or when the pH was increased. 4. At 0.2 mM extracellular glycine, the relative contributions of each of these uptake routes to the total glycine flux were 42, 11, 15 and 16% for the gly, ASC, L and band 3 systems, respectively. 5. Finally, there was a residual Na+-independent component of glycine uptake which contributed 16% of the total flux. With the exception of the gly system, all uptake routes showed a linear concentration dependence up to 2 mM-glycine.	eng	403	422	The Journal of physiology	320		1981	Nov		D000838;D001692/Q000187;D002712/Q000502;D004912/Q000378;D005998/Q000037;D005998/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D012964/Q000502;D013379	Anions;Biological Transport/drug effects;Chlorides/physiology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycine/antagonists & inhibitors;Glycine/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Sodium/physiology;Substrate Specificity	Ellory JC;Jones SE;Young JD	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
270	6122443	Calmodulin regulation of Ca2+ transport in human erythrocytes.	Inside-out vesicles of human erythrocytes took up Ca2+ against an electrochemical gradient. This Ca2+ uptake was dependent on ATP and was stimulated by calmodulin. Treatment of vesicles with 1 mM-EDTA exposed an apparent low-CA2+-affinity Ca2+-transport component with Kd of about 100 microM-Ca2+ or more. This was converted into a single high-Ca2+-affinity transport activity of Kd about 2.5 microM-Ca2+ in the presence of 2 micrograms of calmodulin/ml, showing that the decrease in transport activity after EDTA treatment was reversible. Vesicles not extracted with EDTA showed mainly apparent high-Ca2+-affinity kinetics even in the absence of added calmodulin. Trifluoperazine (30 microM) and calmodulin-binding protein (20 micrograms/ml) inhibited about 50% of the high-affinity Ca2+ uptake and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase (Ca2+-activated, Mg2+-dependent ATPase) activity of these vesicles, indicating that the vesicles isolated by the procedure used retained some calmodulin from the erythrocytes. Comparison of Ca2+ transport and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activities in inside-out vesicles yielded a variable Ca2+/P1 stoichiometric ratio. At low free Ca2+ concentrations (below 20 micro-Ca2+), a Ca2+/P1 ration of about 2 was found, whereas at higher Ca2+ concentrations the stoichiometry was approx. 1. The stoichiometry was not significantly altered by calmodulin.	eng	185	191	The Biochemical journal	200	2	1981	Nov	15	D000251/Q000378;D001692/Q000187;D017301;D002118/Q000097;D002135/Q000494;D000252/Q000378;D002147/Q000494;D004492/Q000494;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D014268/Q000494	Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism;Biological Transport/drug effects;Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase;Calcium/blood;Calcium-Binding Proteins/pharmacology;Calcium-Transporting ATPases/metabolism;Calmodulin/pharmacology;Edetic Acid/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Trifluoperazine/pharmacology	Larsen FL;Katz S;Roufogalis BD	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
271	6271223	Human erythrocyte cytosol phosphatidyl-inositol-bisphosphate phosphatase.	A phosphatidyl-myoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphohydrolase (phosphatidyl-inositol-bisphosphate phosphatase, EC 3.1.3.36) was detected in human erythrocytes and partially purified from the cytosol. Hemoglobin was removed by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and chromatography on CM-Sepharose CL-6B. A 27,000-fold purification was achieved following gel filtration,, ion-exchange chromatography and hydrophobic chromatography. Although the preparation was not homogeneous, the molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 105,000 by gel filtration. The activity was stabilized by a non-ionic detergent (Triton X-100). The enzyme was active with PI-P2 and, to a lesser extent, myo-inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate but not with PI-P nor a variety of other lipid and non-lipid phosphate esters. In the presence of both cationic and non-ionic detergents, the effects of divalent cations were independent of substrate concentration. Mg2+ was required ('apparent' Km = 12 muM). The 'apparent' Km for the substrate was 0.27 mM and the specific activity was 765 +/- 191 (S.D.) nmol/min per mg protein. Inhibition by Ca2+ ('apparent' Ki = 50 microM) was competitive with Mg2+. Neomycin was an inhibitor at 10(-6) - 10(-4) M but only in the absence of Triton X-100. The phosphatase was inhibited by hemoglobin at concentrations higher that 1% (w/v) and by agents which react with sulfhydryl groups, but was unaffected by dithioerythritol and F-.	eng	323	333	Biochimica et biophysica acta	661	2	1981	Oct	13	D000077286;D002593/Q000494;D003600/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D005590;D006801;D006863;D008274/Q000494;D008970;D017830;D010716/Q000037;D010716/Q000097;D010716/Q000302;D010744/Q000037;D010744/Q000097;D010744/Q000302;D011092/Q000494;D013379	Cetrimonium;Cetrimonium Compounds/pharmacology;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Fractional Precipitation;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Magnesium/pharmacology;Molecular Weight;Octoxynol;Phosphatidylinositols/antagonists & inhibitors;Phosphatidylinositols/blood;Phosphatidylinositols/isolation & purification;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/blood;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/isolation & purification;Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology;Substrate Specificity	Roach PD;Palmer FB	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

274	6285891	The inositol trisphosphate phosphomonoesterase of the human erythrocyte membrane.	Human erythrocyte ghosts exhibit an inositol trisphosphate phosphomonoesterase activity that rapidly converts inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate into inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and Pi. Degradation of the released inositol 1,4-bisphosphate is not observed. This activity is dependent on Mg2+ (or Mn2+) and it is not activated by Ca2+. Optimum activity is around pH 7 and activity is abolished by heat denaturation. The Km for inositol trisphosphate is approx. 25 microM. 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is a competitive inhibitor, with a Ki of approx. 0.35 mM. Glycerophosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate is attacked at about one-eighth of the rate for inositol trisphosphate, but glycerophosphoinositol 4-phosphate is not a substrate. Incubation of 32P-labelled erythrocyte membranes with Mg2+ causes little breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, the parent compound from which both glycerophosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate are derived. On the basis of its substrate specificity and the inhibition by 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, we suggest that this enzyme is selective for the 5-phosphate in those water-soluble phosphate esters of inositol that possess the vicinal pair of 4,5-phosphates but that it may also interact less strongly with other water-soluble compounds that have pairs of vicinal phosphates.	eng	169	177	The Biochemical journal	203	1	1982	Apr	01	D002413/Q000494;D004789/Q000187;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D066298;D015544;D007295/Q000378;D000072181;D007700;D010744/Q000037;D010744/Q000097;D013347/Q000201;D013379	Cations, Divalent/pharmacology;Enzyme Activation/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate;Inositol Phosphates/metabolism;Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases;Kinetics;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/blood;Subcellular Fractions/enzymology;Substrate Specificity	Downes CP;Mussat MC;Michell RH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
275	6817948	Measurement of arginine transport in human erythrocytes using their intrinsic arginase activity: implications for the treatment of familial hyperargininemia.	A procedure making use of the intracellular arginase activity has been developed for measuring the transport of arginine across the human erythrocyte membrane. (1) The arginine translocation is carrier mediated with simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, showing one high affinity, low capacity transport system characterized by a half saturation constant KT of 0.177 +/- 0.036 mmol/1, and a maximum velocity VT of 0.332 +/- 0.068 mumol X h-1 X ml-1 cells. (2) Competition experiments with lysine, ornithine and leucine indicated that the arginine transport system in specific for dibasic amino acids. (3) The value calculated for the intracellular arginine concentration agreed well with the values obtained by independent methods. (4) The low arginine transport rate of human erythrocytes can explain the failure to lower the hyperargininemia in familial hyperargininemia by blood transfusion with normal arginase-containing erythrocytes.	eng	209	216	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	126	3	1982	Dec	23	D001119/Q000037;D001119/Q000378;D001120/Q000097;D001692/Q000187;D004355;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D007700;D007930/Q000494;D008239/Q000494;D008297;D009952/Q000494	Arginase/antagonists & inhibitors;Arginase/metabolism;Arginine/blood;Biological Transport/drug effects;Drug Stability;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Kinetics;Leucine/pharmacology;Lysine/pharmacology;Male;Ornithine/pharmacology	Van Broeckhoven CL;Adriaenssens KM;Marescau B;Pintens J;Terheggen HG	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
276	7060551	Glutathione reductase from human erythrocytes. The sequences of the NADPH domain and of the interface domain.	1. Sequence analysis of the NADPH domain (residues 158--293) and of the interface domain (365--478) was based on 12 CNBr fragments, which were isolated using ion-exchange chromatography and paper methods. Fragments with more than 15 residues were digested further with trypsin and chymotrypsin. The isolated peptides were sequenced by automated solid-phase Edman degradation. All sequenced peptides were ordered and overlapped by computerized comparisons with a complete sequence guessed from the electron density map of the protein. In the case of short CNBr fragments, this alignment was confirmed by the sequence analysis of protein fragments resulting from incomplete CNBr cleavage. 2. In the NADPH domain, residue 197, which is involved in an induced-fit mechanism, was identified as a tyrosine. The structure of the NADPH domain is probably homologous with the NAD domain of lipoamide dehydrogenase and with the FAD domain of several proteins, but not with NADPH domains of known chain-fold in other proteins. 3. The paper completes the sequence analysis of glutathione reductase so that the enzyme is now known in atomic detail. The numbering scheme of the chemically determined sequence will be used henceforth in crystallographic studies also. As inferred from the sequence data each of the two identical chains contains 478 amino acid residues, the composition being Cys10, Asp21, Asn17, Thr31, Ser31, Glu29, Gln11, Pro24, Gly43, Ala42, Val44, Met15, Ile29, Leu34, Tyr13, Phe14, Lys34, His16.

277	7082315	Transfer of 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate as oxidizing potential from hepatocytes to erythrocytes.	The interconversions of proline and 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate form an intercellular cycle that is the basis of a metabolic interaction between hepatocytes and erythrocytes. The cycle transfers oxidizing potential from hepatocytes to erythrocytes, which stimulates pentose phosphate pathway in erythrocytes. This interaction depends on the differential metabolism of proline and 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate in erythrocytes and hepatocytes and consists of the following: in hepatocytes proline oxidase converts proline into 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, which is released into the medium and taken up by erythrocytes; erythrocyte 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase converts 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate into proline and concomitantly generates NADP+; the generated oxidizing potential drives glucose metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway in erythrocytes; finally, erythrocytes release proline into the medium, enabling it to re-enter hepatocytes and repeat the cycle. The increased activity of the pentose phosphate pathway in erythrocytes may enhance the production of 5-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, a necessary moiety for the processing of purines.	eng	31	39	The Biochemical journal	202	1	1982	Jan	15	D000818;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D008099/Q000166;D008099/Q000378;D008297;D010084;D010428/Q000097;D010428/Q000378;D011392/Q000378;D011394/Q000378;D011758/Q000378;D051381;D011919;D013268	Animals;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Liver/cytology;Liver/metabolism;Male;Oxidation-Reduction;Pentosephosphates/blood;Pentosephosphates/metabolism;Proline/metabolism;Proline Oxidase/metabolism;Pyrroles/metabolism;Rats;Rats, Inbred Strains;Stimulation, Chemical	Hagedorn CH;Yeh GC;Phang JM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
278	7055559	Transport of neutral amino acids by human erythrocytes.	The transport of several neutral amino acids by human erythrocytes in vitro was studied. The measurements made included steady-state distributions, kinetics of initial rates of uptake, effects of monovalent cations and anions, general mutual inhibitory interactions, kinetics of inhibitions, effluxes, ability to produce accelerative exchange diffusion, and the inhibitory action of the thiol reagent N-ethylmaleimide. The results are interpreted as showing that the human erythrocyte membrane possesses several distinct transport systems for these amino acids, including one Na+-dependent system and one dependent on both Na+ and a suitable anion, that are qualitatively similar to those systems previously described in pigeon erythrocytes and mammalian reticulocytes. Quantitatively, however, the systems differ among the different kinds of red cell and a major difference lies in their abilities to produce accelerative exchange diffusion.	eng	157	171	Biochimica et biophysica acta	684	2	1982	Jan	22	D000596/Q000097;D000596/Q000494;D000838;D001692/Q000187;D004905;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005033/Q000494;D006801;D007700;D011188/Q000494;D012964/Q000494;D013329	Amino Acids/blood;Amino Acids/pharmacology;Anions;Biological Transport/drug effects;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology;Humans;Kinetics;Potassium/pharmacology;Sodium/pharmacology;Structure-Activity Relationship	Al-Saleh EA;Wheeler KP	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

280	6125268	The stoichiometry of the Ca2+ pump in human erythrocyte vesicles: modulation by Ca2+, Mg2+ and calmodulin.	Active Ca2+ uptake and the associated (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity were studied under the same conditions in an inside-out vesicle preparation of human red blood cells made essentially by the procedure of Quist and Roufogalis (Journal of Supramolecular Structure 6, 375-381, 1977). Some preparations were treated with 1 mM EDTA at 30 degrees to further deplete them of endogenous levels of calmodulin. As the Ca2+ taken up by the EDTA-treated inside-out vesicles, as well as the non-EDTA treated vesicles, was maintained after addition of 4.1 mM EGTA, the vesicles were shown to be impermeable to the passive leak of Ca2+ over the time course of the experiments. In the absence of added calmodulin, both active Ca2+ uptake and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase were sensitive to free Ca2+ over a four log unit concentration range (0.7 microM to 300 microM Ca2+) at 6.4 mM MgCl2. Below 24 microM Ca2+ the stoichiometry of calcium transported per phosphate liberated was close to 2:1, both in EDTA and non-EDTA treated vesicles. Above 50 microM Ca2+ the stoichiometry approached 1:1. When MgCl2 was reduced from 6.4 mM to 1.0 mM, the stoichiometry remained close to 2:1 over the whole range of Ca2+ concentrations examined. In contrast to the results at 6.4 mM MgCl2, the Ca2+ pump was maximally activated at about 2 microM free Ca2+ and significantly inhibited above this concentration at 1 mM MgCl2. Calmodulin (0.5-2.0 microgram/ml) had little effect on the stoichiometry in any of the conditions examined. The possible significance of a variable stoichiometry of the Ca2+ pump in the red blood cell is discussed.	eng	1	17	Cell calcium	3	1	1982	Mar		D001693/Q000187;D017301;D002118/Q000097;D002118/Q000494;D002135/Q000494;D000252/Q000097;D002147/Q000494;D004492/Q000494;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D007700;D008274/Q000494	Biological Transport, Active/drug effects;Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase;Calcium/blood;Calcium/pharmacology;Calcium-Binding Proteins/pharmacology;Calcium-Transporting ATPases/blood;Calmodulin/pharmacology;Edetic Acid/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Magnesium/pharmacology	Akyempon CK;Roufogalis BD	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
281	7063276	Human erythrocyte prolidase and prolidase deficiency.	Biochemical studies on human prolidase (EC 3.4.13.9) and prolidase deficiency are described. The urine sample from a 32-year-old female with prolidase deficiency was examined. Diagnosis was based on clinical features and defects of prolidase in her erythrocytes. She excreted massive amounts of iminopeptides, where three major peptides were identified; aspartyl-proline, glutamyl-proline and glycyl-proline. The prolidase was purified approximately 10,000-fold from the normal human erythrocytes through an eight step procedure. The purified enzyme consisted of two identical subunits of which the molecular weight was calculated to be 55,000. The relative cleavage rates of the enzyme for glycyl-L-proline, L-alanyl-L-proline, L-leucyl-L-proline, L-prolyl-L-proline, and glycyl-hydroxy-L-proline were 100%, 53%, 27%, 31% and 2%, respectively. The relative substrate specificity of the enzyme offers a reasonable explantation for the presence of a higher level of urinary imidodipeptides in a patient with prolidase deficiency. An attempt at erythrocyte transfusion was performed, aimed at enzyme replacement therapy. After the transfusion (erythrocytes from 800 ml of whole blood), the prolidase activity of the peripheral erythrocyte was elevated to approximately 35% of the normal values and gradually decreased (half-life, 41 days). During this period urinary peptide-bound proline was monitored, but no significant change was observed.	eng	227	231	Pediatric research	16	3	1982	Mar		D000328;D000596/Q000652;D001803;D004150/Q000097;D004150/Q000172;D004789;D017707;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D007097/Q000652;D010455/Q000652;D011392/Q000097;D011392/Q000172;D011392/Q000378;D013379	Adult;Amino Acids/urine;Blood Transfusion;Dipeptidases/blood;Dipeptidases/deficiency;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocyte Transfusion;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Imines/urine;Peptides/urine;Proline/blood;Proline/deficiency;Proline/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Endo F;Matsuda I;Ogata A;Tanaka S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
282	7061426	Multiple forms of human red blood cell hexokinase. Preparation, characterization, and age dependence.	Human red blood cell hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) has been shown to exist in multiple molecular forms which are separable by ion exchange chromatography. Of the major forms, designated hexokinase Ia, Ib, and Ic, only hexokinase Ia corresponds to hexokinase type I from human liver, while the others differ from every other previously reported hexokinase isozyme. Hexokinase Ib is the predominant form in the fetal erythrocytes, while it is present at lower levels in the red blood cells of adults. Analysis of the hexokinase isozymic pattern in red cells of different mean age shows that the level of hexokinase Ib is also dependent on the age of the cell. The three major forms of hexokinase have the same molecular weight of 100,000, by sedimentation velocity on sucrose density gradients, the same Michaelis constants, substrate and coenzyme specificity, pH-dependent activity, and the same thermal stability. The only significant differences were found in the isoelectric points which were 5.7 pH units for hexokinase Ia, 5.5 pH units for hexokinase Ib, and 5.35 pH units for hexokinase Ic. These data, together with that previously reported for rabbit erythrocytes (Stocchi, V., Magnani, M., Canestrari, F., Dachà, M., and Fornaini, G. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 7856-7861) suggest that the presence of multiple forms of hexokinase is a common phenomenon in mammalian red blood cells.	eng	2357	2364	The Journal of biological chemistry	257	5	1982	Mar	10	D000328;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D005312;D005333;D006593/Q000097;D006593/Q000302;D006801;D007231;D007525;D007527/Q000097;D007527/Q000302;D007700;D008099/Q000201;D008970;D011247;D013379	Adult;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Fetal Blood;Fetus;Hexokinase/blood;Hexokinase/isolation & purification;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Isoelectric Focusing;Isoenzymes/blood;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Kinetics;Liver/enzymology;Molecular Weight;Pregnancy;Substrate Specificity	Stocchi V;Magnani M;Canestrari F;Dachà M;Fornaini G	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
283	6285190	Enzymes of purine and pyrimidine metabolism from the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.	Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites were isolated by mechanical rupture of infected human erythrocytes followed by a series of differential centrifugation steps. After lysis with sonication, the 100 000 x g supernatant of parasites and uninfected host cells was used to determine the specific activities of a number of enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism. P. falciparum possessed the purine salvage enzymes: adenosine deaminase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase), xanthine PRTase, adenine PRTase, adenosine kinase. The last two enzymes, however, were present at much lower activity levels. Hypoxanthine was converted (presumably via IMP) into adenine and guanine nucleotides only in the presence both of supernatant and membrane fractions of P. falciparum. Two enzymes involved in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines, orotic acid PRTase, and orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, were present in parasite extracts as were the enzymes for pyrimidine nucleotide phosphorylation: UMP-CMP kinase, dTMP kinase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase. Xanthine oxidase, CTP synthetase, cytidine deaminase and several kinases for the salvage of pyrimidine nucleosides were not detected in the parasites. Both phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase and uracil PRTase were present but at low activity levels. Human erythrocytes displayed similar but not identical enzyme patterns. Enzyme specific activities, however, were generally much lower than those of the corresponding parasite enzymes.	eng	275	290	Molecular and biochemical parasitology	5	5	1982	May		D000243/Q000378;D000818;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007041/Q000378;D009703/Q000378;D009962/Q000378;D009964/Q000378;D010430/Q000378;D010963/Q000201;D011683/Q000378;D011687/Q000378;D011743/Q000378;D013937/Q000378	Adenosine Deaminase/metabolism;Animals;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/metabolism;Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/metabolism;Orotate Phosphoribosyltransferase/metabolism;Orotidine-5'-Phosphate Decarboxylase/metabolism;Pentosyltransferases/metabolism;Plasmodium falciparum/enzymology;Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/metabolism;Purines/metabolism;Pyrimidines/metabolism;Thymidine Kinase/metabolism	Reyes P;Rathod PK;Sanchez DJ;Mrema JE;Rieckmann KH;Heidrich HG	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
284	7081429	Production of ornithine by intact human erythrocytes.	Although the conversion of arginine to ornithine in humans is largely an hepatic process, erythrocytes also have this enzymatic capacity. We have shown that intact human erythrocytes readily produce ornithine from arginine and release product ornithine to the incubation medium. The rate of ornithine formation from arginine was 0.22 mumol.h-1.ml cells-1, and 85% of the ornithine is recovered extracellularly. Moreover, we have shown that ornithine and urea are the unique and stoichiometric products of arginine metabolism in the intact erythrocyte. The rate of ornithine production by intact red blood cells was a saturable function of arginine concentration in the medium; the derived Km for arginine for this conversion was 0.16 mM, a value striking for its close approximation to physiological arginine concentration in human plasma. We propose that the production and delivery of ornithine by intact red blood cells may supply peripheral tissues such as bone and muscle with an important precursor for proline and polyamines.	eng	C393	C397	The American journal of physiology	242	5	1982	May		D001120/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D009952/Q000096;D014508/Q000096	Arginine/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Ornithine/biosynthesis;Urea/biosynthesis	Williams JA;Phang JM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
285	7138916	Spin ECHO proton NMR studies of the metabolism of malate and fumarate in human erythrocytes. Dependence on free NAD levels.	The NAD-dependent conversion of malate to lactate in human erythrocytes was studied by spin echo proton NMR. A pathway involving the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate catalysed by haemoglobin is proposed to account for the observed reaction. NADP-dependent reaction was negligible. The rate of the reaction was measured in intact erythrocytes under controlled conditions. This rate correlates with that obtained with lysates at 30 microM free NAD and that obtained with purified human erythrocyte enzymes at about 15 microM NAD. The total extractable NAD in the intact cells was 70-90 microM. Experiments with cells containing elevated NAD levels could be explained by a significant fraction of the NAD being weakly bound (Kd about 1 mM) to haemoglobin.	eng	191	200	Biochimica et biophysica acta	721	2	1982	Oct	11	D001692;D004912/Q000378;D005649/Q000097;D005650/Q000097;D006801;D007700;D007773/Q000097;D019344;D009682/Q000379;D008293/Q000097;D009243/Q000097	Biological Transport;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fumarate Hydratase/blood;Fumarates/blood;Humans;Kinetics;Lactates/blood;Lactic Acid;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/methods;Malates/blood;NAD/blood	Simpson RJ;Brindle KM;Campbell ID	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

289	6301709	Immunoassay of three enolase isozymes in human serum and in blood cells.	Sandwich enzyme immunoassay procedures for measurement of three human enolase isozymes (alpha alpha, alpha gamma and gamma gamma forms) were developed by use of purified antibodies specific to the alpha or the gamma subunit of enolase. The assay systems consisted of polystyrene balls with immobilized antibody F(ab')2 fragments and antibody Fab' fragments labeled with beta-D-galactosidase from E. coli. The measurable range was from 3 pg to 10 ng of each enolase isozyme per assay tube, and the levels of the three enolases in human sera and isolated blood cells were determined. Serum samples from healthy adults contained about 60, 8, and 2 ng/ml of alpha alpha, alpha gamma, and gamma gamma enolases, respectively. Red blood cells and platelets had about 4, 1, and 0.1 ng/10(6) cells of alpha alpha, alpha gamma, and gamma gamma enolases, respectively. Lymphocytes (mononuclear cells) contained larger amounts of all three enolases (alpha alpha, 370 ng/10(6) cells; alpha gamma, 30 ng/10(6) cells; gamma gamma, 2.7 ng/10(6) cells).

Electrophoretic and quantitative analysis of pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase in human erythrocytes from healthy individuals and a patient deficient in pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase, using a range of substrates, has shown that the patient has a marked deficiency with UMP, CMP and dCMP as substrates but near normal levels of activity with dUMP and dTMP as substrates. The observations suggest that two separate structural gene loci coding for distinct 5'-nucleotidases with similar electrophoretic mobility exist in man.

291	6838867	Transport and metabolism of 5'-methylthioadenosine in human erythrocytes.	The transport and metabolism of 5'-deoxy-5'-S-methylthioadenosine have been studied in intact human erythrocytes. The sulfur nucleoside is rapidly accumulated into red cells and the extent of uptake largely exceeds the theoretical equilibrium between inner and outer compartment owing to its conversion into a non-permeable compound, namely 5-methylthioribose 1-phosphate. To characterize the nucleoside transport, phosphate-depleted erythrocytes, in which the methylthioadenosine metabolism is negligible, have been employed. The results indicate that: (i) the transport occurs via a facilitated-diffusion mechanism; (ii) the process is not energy-dependent and (iii) no specific cation is required. The kinetic analyses of both the transport and the metabolism show that the uptake of methylthioadenosine is a result of the tandem action of a transport step of high capacity (Vmax = 604 +/- 51 pmol/10(6) cells per min) and low affinity (Km = 3270 +/- 321 microM) followed by a metabolic step of low capacity (Vmax = 6.6 pmol/10(6) cells per min) and high affinity (Km = 30 microM). Furthermore, a substrate inhibition exerted by methylthioadenosine at high concentration (over 200 microM) on its specific phosphorylase is reported for the first time. Experiments performed with several analogs of the thioether indicate that the adenine amino group and the hydrophobic substituent at the 5'-position are critical for the transport carrier recognition. Adenine is the most powerful inhibitor of methylthioadenosine transport.	eng	221	229	Biochimica et biophysica acta	727	2	1983	Jan	19	D000241/Q000031;D000241/Q000097;D001692/Q000187;D002851;D003839;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D012263/Q000494;D013872/Q000097	Adenosine/analogs & derivatives;Adenosine/blood;Biological Transport/drug effects;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Deoxyadenosines;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Ribonucleosides/pharmacology;Thionucleosides/blood	Cartenì-Farina M;della Ragione F;Cacciapuoti G;Porcelli M;Zappia V	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

The relationship between erythroid cell maturation and the change of pyruvate kinase (PK) isozymes was studied using fluorescent antibody techniques. The fluorescence of M2-type PK was strongest in the proerythroblast stage, and then steeply declined with red cell maturation so that only weak fluorescence was seen in orthochromatic erythroblasts. On the other hand, the fluorescence of L-type PK was seen throughout the maturation of the erythroblasts, with stronger fluorescence in the basophilic or polychromatic erythroblasts than in proerythroblasts.	eng	467	474	British journal of haematology	54	3	1983	Jul		D001853/Q000201;D003429;D004591;D004900/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000502;D005455;D006801;D005779;D007527/Q000097;D007668/Q000201;D009500;D011770/Q000097	Bone Marrow/enzymology;Cross Reactions;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythroblasts/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/physiology;Fluorescent Antibody Technique;Humans;Immunodiffusion;Isoenzymes/blood;Kidney/enzymology;Neutralization Tests;Pyruvate Kinase/blood	Takegawa S;Fujii H;Miwa S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;Erythro;red cell;erythro	True

A direct assay procedure is described for D-ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.1) which exploits differences in the c.d. spectra of substrate and product. The enzyme has been purified from human erythrocytes and was resolved by gel filtration and sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation into a major component of apparent Mr 45 000 and a minor component of Mr 23 000. Electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulphate gave a single component corresponding to Mr 23 000. Kinetic and sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation data indicate dissociation of the dimeric form of the enzyme into monomers of low specific activity; substrate favours the active dimeric form of the enzyme. At concentrations of the enzyme where both forms of the enzyme are present initial velocity data yielded a Hill plot with an interaction coefficient of approx. 2.0, indicating co-operative binding of substrate under these conditions.	eng	617	623	The Biochemical journal	211	3	1983	Jun	01	D002238/Q000302;D002499;D002850;D002942;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008970;D013057	Carbohydrate Epimerases/isolation & purification;Centrifugation, Density Gradient;Chromatography, Gel;Circular Dichroism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;Spectrum Analysis	Karmali A;Drake AF;Spencer N	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
294	6871179	S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase from human erythrocytes: role in the regulation of cellular S-adenosylmethionine levels.	The properties of human erythrocyte S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase (ATP:L-methionine S-adenosyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.6) were studied with respect to the role of S-adenosylmethionine in transmethylation reactions. Kinetic values obtained with both a cytosolic and a 350-fold purified preparation of enzyme were compared with measured intracellular concentrations of substrates and products. This analysis revealed that effective regulation of enzyme activity and product concentration can occur through feedback inhibition by S-adenosylmethionine (Ki = 2.0-2.9 microM; the endogenous concentration is 3.5 microM). This enzyme can be distinguished from S-adenosylmethionine synthetases found in other tissues and appears to be specialized for its role in erythrocyte methyl group metabolism, especially with regard to protein carboxyl methyl-transfer reactions.	eng	2978	2986	Biochemistry	22	12	1983	Jun	07	D003600/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008715/Q000097;D008716/Q000097;D008716/Q000302;D012435/Q000097;D012436/Q000097;D014166/Q000097	Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Methionine/blood;Methionine Adenosyltransferase/blood;Methionine Adenosyltransferase/isolation & purification;S-Adenosylhomocysteine/blood;S-Adenosylmethionine/blood;Transferases/blood	Oden KL;Clarke S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
295	6682109	Structural and dynamic states of actin in the erythrocyte.	"Analysis of the nucleotide tightly associated with isolated erythrocyte cytoskeletons show it to be ADP, rather then ATP. This confirms that at least a major part of the erythrocyte actin is in the F-form. A re-evaluation of the stoichiometry of spectrin and actin in the erythrocyte (taking account of a gross difference between the color responses of the two proteins on staining of electrophoretic gels) leads to values of 1x10(5) and 5x10(5) for the number of molecules of spectrin tetramer and actin respectively per cell. It has been found possible to perform spectrophotometric DNAase I assays fro actin on lysed whole cells. The concentration of monomeric actin at 0 degrees C is approximately 16 mug/ml packed cells. After washing the lysed cells the monomer pool is not re-established, indicating that only a small proportion of the actin subunits are free to dissociate. The actin monomer concentration in the cytosol remains unchanged after equilibration of the cells with cytochalasin E. The ability of actin-containing complexes in the membrane to nucleate the polymerization of added G-actin was measured fluorimetrically; it was found that membranes incubated with cytochalasin E were completely inert with respect to nucleating activity under conditions that favor appreciable growth at the slowly-growing (""pointed"") ends of free actin filaments. This suggests that these ends of the actin ""protofilaments"" in the red cell are blocked or sterically obstructed. After treatment of the membranes with guanidine hydrochloride under conditions that dissociate F-actin, the measured concentration of actin monomer rises to approximately 180 mug/ml of packed cells, which is nearly 70 percent of the total actin content. On treatment with trypsin in the presence of DNAase, the spectrin and 4.1 are extensively degraded, but the actin remains undamaged. This treatment, followed by exposure to guanidine hydrochloride, causes a further rise in the concentration of actin responsive to the DNAase assay to 250 mug/ml of cells, compared with 270 mug/ml estimated by densitometry of stained gels. The oligomeric complex, consisting of actin, spectrin, and 4.1, that is extracted from the membrane at low ionic strength, generates no detectable actin monomer after the same treatment. From literature data on the number of cytochalasin binding sites per cell and our value for the total actin content, we obtain a number-average degree of polymerization for actin in the membrane of 12-17. The results lead to a model for the structure of the cytoskeletal network and suggest some consequences of metabolic depletion."	eng	768	775	The Journal of cell biology	96	3	1983	Mar		D000199/Q000097;D000244/Q000097;D001704;D003572/Q000494;D003593/Q000032;D003599/Q000032;D003851/Q000378;D004912/Q000032;D004912/Q000648;D019791;D006146/Q000494;D006801;D013049/Q000032	Actins/blood;Adenosine Diphosphate/blood;Biopolymers;Cytochalasins/pharmacology;Cytoplasm/analysis;Cytoskeleton/analysis;Deoxyribonucleases/metabolism;Erythrocytes/analysis;Erythrocytes/ultrastructure;Guanidine;Guanidines/pharmacology;Humans;Spectrin/analysis	Pinder JC;Gratzer WB	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
296	6826727	Hereditary tyrosinemia and the heme biosynthetic pathway. Profound inhibition of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity by succinylacetone.	Succinylacetone (4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid) is an abnormal metabolite produced in patients with hereditary tyrosinemia as a consequence of an inherited deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. It is known that patients with this hereditary disease excrete excessive amounts of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in urine and that certain patients have an accompanying clinical syndrome resembling that of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). In order to elucidate the relation of succinylacetone to the heme biosynthetic pathway, we have examined the effects of this metabolite on the cellular heme content of cultured avian hepatocytes and on the activity of purified ALA dehydratase from normal human erythrocytes and from mouse and bovine liver. Our data indicate that succinylacetone is an extremely potent competitive inhibitor of ALA dehydratase in human as well as in animal tissues. By using purified preparations of the enzyme from human erythrocytes and mouse and bovine liver, an inhibitor constant ranging from 2 x 10(-7) M to 3 x 10(-7) M was obtained. In cultured hepatocytes, succinylacetone also inhibited ALA dehydratase activity, decreased the cellular content of heme and cytochrome P-450, and greatly potentiated the induction response of ALA synthase to drugs such as phenobarbital, chemicals such as allylisopropylacetamide and 3,5-dicarbethoxy-1,4-dihydrocollidine, and natural steroids such as etiocholanolone. Four patients with hereditary tyrosinemia have been studied and all were found to have greatly depressed levels of erythrocyte ALA dehydratase activity and elevated concentrations of this inhibitor in urine. These findings indicate that tyrosinemia is a disorder of special pharmacogenetic interest because succinylacetone, an abnormal product of the tyrosine metabolic pathway, resulting from the primary gene defect of the disease, profoundly inhibits heme biosynthesis in normal cells through a blockade at the ALA dehydratase level, leading to clinical and metabolic consequences that mimic another genetic disease, AIP.	eng	625	634	The Journal of clinical investigation	71	3	1983	Mar		D000592/Q000201;D000818;D002417;D002642;D004912/Q000201;D006418/Q000096;D006537/Q000494;D006538/Q000494;D006801;D066298;D008099/Q000201;D051379;D008807;D000623/Q000037;D013045;D014443/Q000097	Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/enzymology;Animals;Cattle;Chick Embryo;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Heme/biosynthesis;Heptanoates/pharmacology;Heptanoic Acids/pharmacology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Liver/enzymology;Mice;Mice, Inbred BALB C;Porphobilinogen Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors;Species Specificity;Tyrosine/blood	Sassa S;Kappas A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
297	6406103	Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase activity in human erythrocytes.	An enzyme capable of degrading 5'-methylthioadenosine to adenine was found in the human erythrocyte. A rapid assay for this enzyme, 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, was developed using high pressure liquid chromatography. The specific activity in 24 normal subjects was 8.9 +/- 2.0 nmol . mg-1 Hb . h-1. Levels within this range were also found in erythrocyte lysates from gouty subjects and patients with a variety of inborn errors of purine metabolism, including patients with a complete deficiency of the adenine salvage enzyme--adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. Erythrocyte lysates from the latter however, were unable to convert the adenine produced to AMP in a linked assay system, in contrast to controls and other patients. These results support the suggestion that adenine, which is excreted in quantity by patients with adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency is derived endogenously from 5'-methylthioadenosine as a by-product of polyamine biosynthesis.	eng	283	290	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	128	2-3	1983	Mar	14	D000225/Q000378;D000228/Q000172;D000328;D002851;D004912/Q000201;D006073/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D010430/Q000097;D011683/Q000097;D011686;D012016	Adenine/metabolism;Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency;Adult;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Gout/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Pentosyltransferases/blood;Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/blood;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors;Reference Values	Sahota A;Webster DR;Potter CF;Simmonds HA;Rodgers AV;Gibson T	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
298	6574471	Selective accumulation of cytosol CDP-choline as an isolated erythrocyte defect in chronic hemolysis.	Erythrocytes from a young woman with chronic hemolytic anemia were found to contain 0.31-0.45 mM CDP-choline, concentrations that are 15-25 times those in normal erythrocytes and equivalent to 20-30% of the total adenine nucleotide content. Accumulation of CDP-choline has been reported only in erythrocytes from subjects with severe (homozygous) pyrimidine nucleotidase deficiency. In the latter syndrome, however, pyrimidine nucleotidase activity is very low and a spectrum of uridine- and cytidine-containing nucleotides is present along with epiphenomena involving glutathione and ribosephosphate pyrophosphokinase. By contrast, selective accumulation of CDP-choline was the only abnormality demonstrable in proband erythrocytes. Membrane phospholipids were quantitatively and qualitatively normal, compatible with the observation that mature erythrocytes maintain membrane phospholipids largely by passive exchange with plasma components or by acylation of lysophospholipids. Although the presence of small amounts of other CDP-containing cofactors, such as CDP-ethanolamine, could not be entirely excluded, the cytidine/choline ratio closely approximated 1:1 in all studies. These data are compatible with the view that choline phosphotransferase and ethanolamine phosphotransferase are separate enzymes in erythroid cells. Selective accumulation of CDP-choline in proband erythrocytes is also compatible with an inherited deficiency of choline phosphotransferase in erythroid precursors, though this hypothesis remains unproved.	eng	3081	3085	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	80	10	1983	May		D000293;D000743/Q000235;D000743/Q000378;D002794/Q000031;D003566/Q000097;D003600/Q000378;D004905;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D010375;D013056	Adolescent;Anemia, Hemolytic/genetics;Anemia, Hemolytic/metabolism;Choline/analogs & derivatives;Cytidine Diphosphate Choline/blood;Cytosol/metabolism;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Pedigree;Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet	Paglia DE;Valentine WN;Nakatani M;Rauth BJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True

Erythrocytes from a patient with classical pyrimidine nucleotidase (PyN) deficiency had less than 10% residual PyN activity with uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) or cytidine 5'-monophosphate (CMP) as substrate, but exhibited brisk nucleotidase activity with thymidine 5'-monophosphate (dTMP). This strongly suggests the existence of separate enzymes or isozymes of PyN in normal human erythrocytes--an hypothesis that should be tested by similar studies in other cases of severe PyN deficiency, whether induced by genetic defects or lead toxicity.	eng	1147	1149	Blood	62	5	1983	Nov		D015720;D003568/Q000378;D004905;D004912/Q000032;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D008875;D009708/Q000172;D011742/Q000097;D013936;D014542/Q000378	5'-Nucleotidase;Cytidine Monophosphate/metabolism;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocytes/analysis;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Middle Aged;Nucleotidases/deficiency;Pyrimidine Nucleotides/blood;Thymidine;Uridine Monophosphate/metabolism	Paglia DE;Valentine WN;Keitt AS;Brockway RA;Nakatani M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
300	6617076	Thiol methylation pharmacogenetics: heritability of human erythrocyte thiol methyltransferase activity.	"Thiol methylation of aliphatic sulfhydryl drugs is catalyzed by thiol methyltransferase (TMT), an enzyme activity that can be measured in the human erythrocyte (RBC) membrane. As a first step toward determining the possible role of inheritance in the regulation of individual variations in the S-methylation of drugs in man, the heritability of human RBC membrane TMT activity was determined. RBC TMT activity was measured in blood samples from 231 first-degree relatives in 47 randomly selected families. The frequency distribution of enzyme activities was unimodal, with a fivefold variation within +/- 2 SDs. RBC TMT activity did not correlate with either age or sex. Heritability in the ""narrow"" sense (h2) was estimated by comparing correlations of RBC TMT activities in first-degree relatives with theoretical values expected for a trait under total additive genetic control. The correlation between RBC TMT activities in mothers and fathers in these families was only 0.04, a finding that made shared environment a less likely explanation for significant correlations among other family members. However, sibling-sibling (S-S), parent-offspring (P-O), and midparent (average of two parental values)-offspring (M-O) correlations were 0.49, 0.49, and 0.69.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"	eng	521	528	Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics	34	4	1983	Oct		D000293;D000328;D002648;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007700;D008297;D008745;D008780/Q000097;D008780/Q000235;D008875;D011897	Adolescent;Adult;Child;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Kinetics;Male;Methylation;Methyltransferases/blood;Methyltransferases/genetics;Middle Aged;Random Allocation	Keith RA;Van Loon J;Wussow LF;Weinshilboum RM	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
301	6626181	Purification of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase from human erythrocytes. Immunochemical evidence for a single protein with decarboxylase activity in human erythrocytes and liver.	Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.37) has been purified 4419-fold to a specific activity of 58.3 nmol of coproporphyrinogen III formed/min per mg of protein (with pentacarboxyporphyrinogen III as substrate) from human erythrocytes by adsorption to DEAE-cellulose, (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, gel filtration, phenyl-Sepharose chromatography and polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Progressive loss of activity towards uroporphyrinogens I and III occurred during purification. Experiments employing immunoprecipitation, immunoelectrophoresis and titration with solid-phase antibody indicated that all the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity of human erythrocytes resides in one protein, and that the substrate specificity of this protein had changed during purification. The purified enzyme had a minimum mol.wt. of 39 500 on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Gel filtration gave a mol.wt. of 58 000 for the native enzyme. Isoelectric focusing showed a single band with a pI of 4.60. Reaction with N-ethylmaleimide abolished both catalytic activity and immunoreactivity. Incubation with substrates or porphyrins prevented inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide. An antiserum raised against purified erythrocyte enzyme precipitated more than 90% of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity from human liver. Quantitative immunoprecipitation and crossed immunoelectrophoresis showed that the erythrocyte and liver enzymes are very similar but not identical. The differences observed may reflect secondary modification of enzyme structure by proteolysis or oxidation of thiol groups, rather than a difference in primary structure.	eng	45	55	The Biochemical journal	215	1	1983	Oct	01	D002262/Q000097;D002846;D004591;D004912/Q000201;D005033/Q000494;D006801;D007122;D007123;D066298;D008099/Q000201;D013379;D014575/Q000037;D014575/Q000097;D014575/Q000302	Carboxy-Lyases/blood;Chromatography, Affinity;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology;Humans;Immunoelectrophoresis;Immunoelectrophoresis, Two-Dimensional;In Vitro Techniques;Liver/enzymology;Substrate Specificity;Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors;Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase/blood;Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase/isolation & purification	Elder GH;Tovey JA;Sheppard DM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
302	6317231	Erythrocyte nucleotide pattern in two children in a Norwegian family with pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase deficiency.	In the erythrocytes from two Norwegian children, a brother and a sister, with a hemolytic anemia due to pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase deficiency, the pyrimidine and purine nucleotides have been investigated using HPLC with a strong anionic exchanger. The standard procedure was complemented with some additional elution systems which made it feasible to separate in the extract and to analyse, in addition to the conventional mono-, di- and triphosphates, UDP-glucose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine. The two different purine nucleotides (A, G) and the two different pyrimidine nucleotides (U, C) exhibited normal ratios (energy charge ratios) between the conventional nucleotides. This would indicate that the erythrocytes have a sufficient energy production. It is suggested that the partly intravascular hemolysis might be due to disturbed synthesis of phospholipids.	eng	25	33	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	134	1-2	1983	Oct	31	D015720;D002648;D002851;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D008297;D009708/Q000172;D009711/Q000097;D010743/Q000097;D011742/Q000097	5'-Nucleotidase;Child;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Male;Nucleotidases/deficiency;Nucleotides/blood;Phospholipids/blood;Pyrimidine Nucleotides/blood	Ericson A;de Verdier CH;Hansen TW;Seip M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
303	6309805	Phosphoprotein phosphatases in human erythrocyte cytosol.	More than 97% of spectrin phosphatase activity in human erythrocyte hemolysate was recovered in cytosol. The cytosolic phosphatase activity was resolved into four peaks, namely phosphatases I (22%, Mr = 180,000), II (3%, Mr = 42,000), III (8%, Mr = 177,000), and IV (62%, Mr = 104,000), by aminohexyl-Sepharose column chromatography. Although these phosphoprotein phosphatases also catalyzed the dephosphorylation of phosphorylase a, glycogen synthase b, and phosphorylated H1 and H2B histones, the phosphatases differed from each other in preferences for substrates and the Mg2+ or Mn2+ requirements for their activities. The treatment with 80% ethanol converted phosphatases I, III, and IV to Mr = 31,000 forms which had essentially the same physical and catalytic properties. By contrast, the molecular weight and catalytic properties of phosphatase II, which was Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent, were not changed by the same ethanol treatment. The major spectrin phosphatase, phosphatase IV, was purified to near homogeneity, as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme was composed of one 32,000-Da polypeptide (alpha) and one 69,000-Da polypeptide (beta). Km values of the enzyme for phosphorylated spectrin and H2B histone were 1.63 +/- 0.45 and 48.2 +/- 7.6 microM, respectively. The spectrin phosphatase activity was stimulated about 2-fold by 5-25 mM Mg2+, but was completely inhibited by the same concentration of Mn2+. Physiological concentrations of adenine nucleotides, 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, cyclic nucleotides, or Ca2+ and/or calmodulin had no significant effect on the reaction, but 20 mg/ml of hemoglobin inhibited the reaction by 60%. -SH-blocking agents but not iodoacetate inhibited the reaction.	eng	10455	10463	The Journal of biological chemistry	258	17	1983	Sep	10	D002850;D003600/Q000201;D004591;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D046911;D008274/Q000378;D008345/Q000378;D008970;D010749/Q000097	Chromatography, Gel;Cytosol/enzymology;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Macromolecular Substances;Magnesium/metabolism;Manganese/metabolism;Molecular Weight;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/blood	Usui H;Kinohara N;Yoshikawa K;Imazu M;Imaoka T;Takeda M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
304	6096072	Cyclic nucleotide metabolism in the human erythrocyte.	Erythrocytes, which show little or no guanylate or adenylate cyclase activity, take up cyclic nucleotides from blood. Studies were done by incubating human erythrocytes in isotonic medium with the dibutyryl derivatives of cAMP and cGMP and in a hypotonic medium in which the cells are partially hemolyzed and, therefore, freely permeable to cAMP and cGMP. At cAMP and cGMP concentrations of 50 microM and above, the amount of 14CO2 generated from 1-14C-glucose was decreased significantly. This effect was suppressed by 4.6 mM theophylline. Inosine and ribose, which are catabolites of cAMP and cGMP also decreased formation of 14CO2 from 1-14C-glucose. Accordingly, it is postulated that in the absence of theophylline, the activity of phosphodiesterase resulted in AMP and GMP formation. These mononucleotides enter into the purine salvage pathways to form ribose phosphate. Additionally, the production of lactate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) was measured in human erythrocytes after incubation with the dibutyryl derivatives of cAMP (bt2-cAMP) and cGMP (bt2-cGMP). At a concentration of 0.1 microM, bta2-cGMP inhibits lactate production at 60 min (p less than 0.01). Slight increases in 2,3-DPG were not statistically significant. Catabolism of cyclic nucleotides may prevent diffusion equilibria allowing for the erythrocyte's continuous uptake of cyclic nucleotides and providing a detoxification mechanism that could compensate for conditions in which elevations of these substances are observed.	eng	227	238	Clinical physiology and biochemistry	2	5	1984			D003994/Q000494;D003995/Q000494;D004163/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D006600/Q000097;D006801;D007288/Q000494;D007773/Q000097;D009712/Q000097;D009994;D012266/Q000494;D013806/Q000494	Bucladesine/pharmacology;Dibutyryl Cyclic GMP/pharmacology;Diphosphoglyceric Acids/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hexosephosphates/blood;Humans;Inosine/pharmacology;Lactates/blood;Nucleotides, Cyclic/blood;Osmolar Concentration;Ribose/pharmacology;Theophylline/pharmacology	DeBari VA;Novak NA;Bennun A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
305	6150821	Human erythrocyte membrane thiol methyltransferase. S-methylation of captopril, N-acetylcysteine, and 7 alpha-thio-spirolactone.	Thiol methylation is an important pathway in the biotransformation of sulfhydryl drugs such as captopril. Human red blood cell (RBC) membranes contain a thiol methyltransferase (TMT) activity that catalyzes the S-methylation of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). These experiments were performed to determine whether human RBC membranes contained enzymes that could catalyze the S-methylation of thiol drugs, and, if so, to determine whether those enzymes were similar to the RBC membrane TMT that catalyzes the S-methylation of 2-ME. Human RBC membranes were able to catalyze the methylation of captopril, N-acetylcysteine, and 7 alpha-thio-spirolactone, a sulfhydryl metabolite of spironolactone. Those activities and 2-ME TMT were similar with respect to subcellular distribution, inhibitor sensitivity, and thermal stability. When activities of the methyltransferase enzymes for 2-ME and for the three thiol drugs were measured in RBC membranes from 19 individual subjects, there were highly significant correlations among all four activities (r greater than 0.96 for all comparisons). These observations suggested either that a single enzyme in the human RBC membrane catalyzed the S-methylation of all of these compounds, or, less likely, that these were four separate activities regulated in parallel with similar properties. Experiments were then performed to identify the products of the enzyme reactions. The product of the reaction performed with 7 alpha-thio-spirolactone was the expected S-methyl derivative, 7 alpha-thiomethyl-spirolactone. However, it was found that lipophilic conjugates of the S-methyl derivatives of captopril and N-acetylcysteine were formed during the in vitro enzyme reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	eng	717	724	Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals	12	6	1984			D000111/Q000378;D000328;D002216/Q000378;D002851;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D013058;D008745;D008780/Q000378;D013148/Q000031;D013148/Q000378;D013438/Q000378	Acetylcysteine/metabolism;Adult;Captopril/metabolism;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Mass Spectrometry;Methylation;Methyltransferases/metabolism;Spironolactone/analogs & derivatives;Spironolactone/metabolism;Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism	Keith RA;Jardine I;Kerremans A;Weinshilboum RM	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True

307	6437213	Kinin cleavage by human erythrocytes.	"An aminopeptidase-P has been purified 230-fold from human erythrocytes. The purified enzyme cleaved arginine from des-(Arg9)-bradykinin (Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe) had a molecular weight in nondenaturing buffers of 155,000 +/- 6,900 daltons, was not inactivated by chelating agents, had a pH optimum of 7.2, and was stimulated by manganous ions. The aminopeptidase-P was stable in intact erythrocytes for at least 21 days. Extensively washed and intact human erythrocytes cleaved arginine from exogenously supplied des-(Arg9)-bradykinin; arginine was the earliest-appearing reaction product. Purified aminopeptidase-P also cleaved a group of X-proline dipeptides including leucyl-proline, methionyl-proline, phenylalanyl-proline, arginyl-proline, and alanyl-proline.

309	6732753	A mathematical model for the cell age-dependent decline of creatine in human cell cells.	A mathematical model is proposed to describe the decline of creatine concentration in red blood cells during the course of cell aging. It is based on experimental data concerning two processes of creatine transport across the red cell membrane: a) an active transport, and b) exchange diffusion. The model corresponds well with data obtained from density-fractionated human red cells in normal steady-state erythropoiesis as well as in acutely and chronically activated erythropoiesis. Degradation of the carrier system for active transport is postulated to be the cause of the time course of decline of the cellular creatine concentration.	eng	153	158	Biomedica biochimica acta	43	2	1984			D003401/Q000097;D004905;D004912/Q000032;D006801;D007700;D008433;D008954	Creatine/blood;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocytes/analysis;Humans;Kinetics;Mathematics;Models, Biological	Holzhütter HG;Syllm-Rapoport I;Daniel A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell;erythro	True
310	6328143	An investigation of 2':3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.37, CNP) in peripheral blood elements and CNS myelin.	Activity of 2':3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) of human erythrocyte membranes was determined in the presence of various brain CNP inhibitory compounds. Also, the hydrolysis of 2':3'-cAMP and 2':3'-cCMP by CNP of human platelets and lymphocytes was confirmed by thin layer chromatography and CNP activity was measured in lymphocytes, platelets, erythrocytes and CNS myelin. Human erythrocyte CNP activity was reduced 75 percent by the organomercurial p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate (1 X 10(-4) M), 46 percent by thimerosal (1 X 10(-4) M) and 35 percent by cupric chloride (1 X 10(-3) M). The 2'-AMP or 2'-CMP isomer was produced, exclusively, by the hydrolysis of 2':3'-cAMP or 2':3'-cCMP, respectively, by CNP of human lymphocytes and platelets and indicates a CNP-like activity is not only present in erythrocytes and the central and peripheral nervous systems, but also platelets and lymphocytes. CNP activities of human erythrocytes, human human and rat lymphocytes and human platelets were less than 4 percent of the activity of human and bovine CNS myelin.	eng	1731	1737	Life sciences	34	18	1984	Apr	30	D015087/Q000378;D000818;D001792/Q000201;D002417;D002855;D004305;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D066298;D008214/Q000201;D009186/Q000201;D010726/Q000494;D010727/Q000378;D051381	2',3'-Cyclic-Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases/metabolism;Animals;Blood Platelets/enzymology;Cattle;Chromatography, Thin Layer;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Lymphocytes/enzymology;Myelin Sheath/enzymology;Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology;Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/metabolism;Rats	Sheedlo HJ;Doran JE;Sprinkle TJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
311	6150932	A proton nuclear magnetic resonance study of gamma-glutamyl-amino acid cyclotransferase in human erythrocytes.	Spin-echo NMR spectroscopy was shown to be a reliable technique for the monitoring of the in situ cleavage of gamma-Glu-Ala by gamma-glutamyl-amino acid cyclotransferase in whole erythrocytes and hemolysates. Of particular importance was the difference in chemical shifts between peptide resonances and those of the constituent amino acids. Using lysates of varying dilution, it was shown that the specific activity of the enzyme was not concentration-dependent, thus suggesting a lack of cytosolic low-molecular-weight-effectors or enzyme dissociation. Furthermore, the initial velocities of the reaction as a function of substrate concentration obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km = 2.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/l and Vmax = 137 +/- 7 mmol/h/l of cell water in 1H2O medium. Similar analysis in 2H2O medium revealed a solvent kinetic isotope effect of 1.9 +/- 0.4 at low substrate concentrations. The implications of this observation for the mechanism of the reaction are discussed. Cleavage of the peptide by a suspension of intact erythrocytes was at a rate 300 times less than the corresponding lysate flux, thus indicating the rate limitation by transport in the coupled system.	eng	15085	15088	The Journal of biological chemistry	259	24	1984	Dec	25	D000217/Q000097;D003903;D017666;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D009682/Q000379;D014867;D005722/Q000097	Acyltransferases/blood;Deuterium;Deuterium Oxide;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/methods;Water;gamma-Glutamylcyclotransferase/blood	York MJ;Kuchel PW;Chapman BE	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
312	6323606	Evidence for a specific phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate phosphatase in human erythrocyte membranes.	Human erythrocyte membranes exhibit a specific phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate phosphohydrolase (PtdIns4P phosphatase) activity which hydrolyzes PtdIns4P and lysoPtdIns4P but not phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) or lysoPtdIns(4,5)P2. Phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidic acid, glycerophosphoinositol 4-phosphate, glycerophosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, inositol mono, bis, and tris phosphates and several other sugar and nucleoside phosphates are not hydrolyzed. The PtdIns4P phosphatase activity is not affected by Ca2+ or Mg2+ ions nor inhibited by EDTA. Maximum in vitro activity requires non-ionic (Triton X-100) detergents. The phosphatase is very stable in isolated membranes at low temperatures but is rapidly inactivated above 35 degrees C. This critical inactivation temperature is lowered to 20-25 degrees C by solubilizing the membranes with non-ionic detergents. Arrhenius plots of the activity show an inflection at these critical temperatures, suggesting a temperature-dependent change in the environment or conformation of the enzyme. Sulfhydryl-reacting reagents are potent inhibitors. Dithioerythritol stimulates only when the membranes are solubilized with non-ionic detergent. The location of cation-independent PtdIns4P phosphatase activity in the membrane and of Mg2+-dependent PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatase activity in the cytosol was also observed for monkey, rabbit, rat, and dog erythrocytes. Both activities are located in the cytosol of sheep erythrocytes.	eng	75	85	Journal of lipid research	25	1	1984	Jan		D000818;D003902/Q000494;D004285;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D000882;D006801;D007700;D008274/Q000494;D017830;D009928;D010744/Q000097;D011092/Q000494;D011817;D051381;D012756;D013379;D013439/Q000494;D013816	Animals;Detergents/pharmacology;Dogs;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Haplorhini;Humans;Kinetics;Magnesium/pharmacology;Octoxynol;Organ Specificity;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/blood;Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology;Rabbits;Rats;Sheep;Substrate Specificity;Sulfhydryl Reagents/pharmacology;Thermodynamics	Mack SE;Palmer FB	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Human erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was purified to homogeneity by a simplified procedure, consisting of 2',5'-ADP-Sepharose affinity chromatography, followed by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. The carboxy-terminal region of the protein was identified by carboxypeptidase digestion: the sequence -Lys-Leu-COOH was found instead of the reported -Gly-COOH, thus showing identity with the carboxy-terminal sequence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from human leukocytes and platelets. In addition, the carboxyl-terminal peptide was isolated from a tryptic digest of the protein and sequenced. The sequence is: Trp-Val-Asp-Pro-His-Lys-Leu.	eng	332	338	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	118	1	1984	Jan	13	D000595;D002268;D002851;D004912/Q000201;D005954/Q000097;D005954/Q000302;D006801;D010446/Q000032;D014357	Amino Acid Sequence;Carboxypeptidases;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/blood;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/isolation & purification;Humans;Peptide Fragments/analysis;Trypsin	Descalzi-Cancedda F;Caruso C;Romano M;di Prisco G;Camardella L	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
314	6692576	Levels of immunoreactive aldolase C, creatine kinase-BB, neuronal and non-neuronal enolase, and 14-3-3 protein in circulating human blood cells.	Five proteins found in the human nervous system have been measured by radioimmunoassay in human red cells, platelets, and lymphocytes. Two neuronal proteins (neurone-specific enolase and 14-3-3 protein) occur in platelets at levels equivalent to their concentration in brain, and in erythrocytes at levels approximately 10% of the level in brain. Two proteins characteristic of astrocytes in the cerebral cortex (creatine kinase BB and aldolase C) occur at low levels in platelets and are virtually undetectable in erythrocytes and lymphocytes. The more widely distributed non-neuronal enolase is present in erythrocytes, platelets and lymphocytes. The neurone-specific enolase and 14-3-3 protein immunoreactivities found in circulating blood cells have been characterised in terms of molecular mass, charge, and dilution characteristics in the respective radioimmunoassay and in each case appears to represent the intact protein. Controlled lysis of erythrocytes releases neurone-specific enolase and 14-3-3 protein in parallel with haemoglobin. The occurrence of brain proteins in circulating blood cells (which appears to be a species-dependent phenomenon) has the practical clinical consequence that minor degrees of especially red cell lysis can produce high serum levels of immunoreactivity. This represents a pitfall in the measurement of these proteins in serum as tumour markers or as indices of damage to the central nervous system.	eng	219	228	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	136	2-3	1984	Jan	31	D048948;D001773/Q000032;D001773/Q000201;D001792/Q000032;D003402/Q000032;D004912/Q000032;D005634/Q000032;D006461;D006801;D007527;D008214/Q000032;D009419/Q000032;D010751/Q000032;D011863;D014446	14-3-3 Proteins;Blood Cells/analysis;Blood Cells/enzymology;Blood Platelets/analysis;Creatine Kinase/analysis;Erythrocytes/analysis;Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase/analysis;Hemolysis;Humans;Isoenzymes;Lymphocytes/analysis;Nerve Tissue Proteins/analysis;Phosphopyruvate Hydratase/analysis;Radioimmunoassay;Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase	Day IN;Thompson RJ	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte;Erythrocyte;red cell	True
315	6327723	Phosphoinositide metabolism and the morphology of human erythrocytes.	ATP-depleted human erythrocytes lose their smooth discoid shape and adopt a spiny, crenated form. This shape change coincides with the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol. Both crenation and lipid dephosphorylation are accelerated by iodoacetamide, and both are reversed by nutrient supplementation. The observed changes in lipid populations should shrink the membrane inner monolayer by 0.6%, consistent with estimates of bilayer imbalance in crenated cells. These observations suggest that metabolic crenation arises from a loss of inner monolayer area secondary to the degradation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid. A related process, crenation after Ca2+ loading, appears to arise from a loss inositides by a different pathway.	eng	1992	1998	The Journal of cell biology	98	6	1984	Jun		D000255/Q000097;D004910/Q000648;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000502;D004912/Q000648;D006801;D007460/Q000494;D007700;D008855;D010716/Q000097;D010743/Q000097;D010761	Adenosine Triphosphate/blood;Erythrocyte Membrane/ultrastructure;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/physiology;Erythrocytes/ultrastructure;Humans;Iodoacetamide/pharmacology;Kinetics;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning;Phosphatidylinositols/blood;Phospholipids/blood;Phosphorus Radioisotopes	Ferrell JE;Huestis WH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
316	6199982	Transport of water and urea in red blood cells.	Evidence for water channels in red blood cells is reviewed. In an entropically driven reaction, organic mercurials decrease water permeability, elevate the activation energy, and reduce the ratio of osmotic to diffusional water permeabilities to unity so that water transport properties of red blood cells are hardly distinguishable from lipid bilayers. It is concluded that mercurials close the water channels. A variety of kinetic, pharmacological, and comparative evidence converges on the conclusion that urea and other solutes are excluded from water channels. Urea apparently permeates the red cell membrane via a facilitated diffusion system, which plays an important role when red blood cells traverse the renal medulla; rapid urea transport helps preserve the osmotic stability and deformability of the cell, and it helps prevent dissipation of extracellular osmotic gradients. Water apparently traverses the channel via a single-file mechanism; the very low channel permeability of H+ is explained if the channel contains fixed charge, or alternatively, if the mobile water molecules within the channel do not form a continuum. An alternative unitary pore hypothesis for simultaneous transport of water, ions, and small solutes is also discussed.	eng	C195	C203	The American journal of physiology	246	3 Pt 1	1984	Mar		D001692;D002463;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000502;D006096/Q000378;D006801;D007473/Q000032;D007473/Q000378;D007473/Q000648;D007679/Q000098;D013997;D014018;D014508/Q000097;D014867/Q000378	Biological Transport;Cell Membrane Permeability;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/physiology;Gramicidin/metabolism;Humans;Ion Channels/analysis;Ion Channels/metabolism;Ion Channels/ultrastructure;Kidney Medulla/blood supply;Time Factors;Tissue Distribution;Urea/blood;Water/metabolism	Macey RI	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
317	6320931	Identification of cytidine diphosphodiesters in erythrocytes from a patient with pyrimidine nucleotidase deficiency.	Pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase deficient (PND) erythrocytes contain elevated levels of pyrimidine nucleotides and relatively normal purine nucleotide levels. The composition of this nucleotide pool has been examined by others, but not all of the abnormal red cell metabolites in this disorder were identified. We have isolated and positively confirmed the identity of cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-choline and CDP-ethanolamine from PND red cells using methods including proton FT-NMR, spectroscopy, and comparative mass spectrometry. The concentrations of these and other pyrimidine nucleotidase-deficient erythrocyte nucleotides were determined using anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet (u.v.) detection. The pyrimidine diphosphodiesters appear to be the most prominent abnormal pyrimidine nucleotides in PND red cells, accounting for 55% of the total red cell pyrimidine nucleotides in this disorder. It is proposed that these abnormal phosphodiesters may be related to the accelerated hemolysis in PND.	eng	665	670	Blood	63	3	1984	Mar		D015720;D000328;D000746/Q000097;D002794/Q000031;D003565/Q000031;D003565/Q000097;D003566/Q000097;D003597/Q000097;D004910/Q000032;D004912/Q000032;D004912/Q000201;D004983/Q000097;D006801;D009682;D008297;D013058;D009708/Q000172;D010743/Q000097	5'-Nucleotidase;Adult;Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital Nonspherocytic/blood;Choline/analogs & derivatives;Cytidine Diphosphate/analogs & derivatives;Cytidine Diphosphate/blood;Cytidine Diphosphate Choline/blood;Cytosine Nucleotides/blood;Erythrocyte Membrane/analysis;Erythrocytes/analysis;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Ethanolamines/blood;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Male;Mass Spectrometry;Nucleotidases/deficiency;Phospholipids/blood	Swanson MS;Markin RS;Stohs SJ;Angle CR	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

We found that adenylate cyclase activity of human erythrocytes is potentially labile during isolation of their plasmalemma. Addition of 1 mM EGTA to solution used to remove hemoglobin from lysed cells protected activity. Human erythrocyte adenylate cyclase is minimally activated by catecholamines, in the absence or presence of exogenous guanyl nucleotide, but substantially by 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate or sodium fluoride and concentration-dependently by Mg2+ or Mn2+. Basal catalytic activity is an age-dependent component of the human erythrocyte; 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate- or fluoride-activated activities decline with cellular maturation proportionally to the decrease in basal activity.	eng	122	126	Biochimica et biophysica acta	770	2	1984	Mar	14	D000262/Q000097;D002458;D004533/Q000494;D004905;D004912/Q000201;D006165/Q000494;D006801;D007545/Q000494;D008274/Q000494;D008345/Q000494;D012969/Q000494	Adenylyl Cyclases/blood;Cell Fractionation;Egtazic Acid/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Guanylyl Imidodiphosphate/pharmacology;Humans;Isoproterenol/pharmacology;Magnesium/pharmacology;Manganese/pharmacology;Sodium Fluoride/pharmacology	Nakagawa M;Willner J;Cerri C;Reydel P	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
319	6466732	In vitro studies on the entry of polyamines into normal red blood cells.	Polyamines are mainly transported in the blood by erythrocytes: Putrescine, spermidine and spermine can be taken up in vitro by red blood cells (RBC); their entry is greater in the presence of serum than in the presence of plasma, and spermine entry is lower than that observed for the two other polyamines. In the presence of serum, the affinity of RBC for spermidine is 30 fold greater than that for putrescine. The majority of RBC polyamines are present in the hemolysate and are not complexed to high molecular weight material. At + 4 degrees C the polyamine uptake is considerably reduced and for putrescine and spermine practically non existent, but it seems that it is internalization rather than binding which constitutes the dependent step. Though intracellular spermidine and spermine levels reflect differences in uptake rather than in outward flux across the cell membrane, the values of putrescine appear to be the resultant of influx and efflux. The presence of specific receptor sites for polyamines visualized by SEM on the surface of RBC using latex-putrescine spheres, confirms the results obtained with labelled polyamines. Therefore, only the understanding of the polyamine repartition inside the blood compartments would permit the clinical use of those molecules as non statistical tumor markers.	eng	385	393	Biochimie	66	5	1984	May		D001692;D004734;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000648;D005260;D006801;D066298;D007700;D008297;D008855;D011073/Q000097;D011700/Q000097;D013095/Q000097;D013096/Q000097	Biological Transport;Energy Metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/ultrastructure;Female;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Male;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning;Polyamines/blood;Putrescine/blood;Spermidine/blood;Spermine/blood	Moulinoux JP;Le Calve M;Quemener V;Quash G	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
320	6727868	Substrate specificity of the monooxygenase activity of hemoglobin.	Hemoglobin has been characterized as a monooxygenase-like catalyst of aniline hydroxylation both in reconstituted systems [ Mieyal et al. J. Biol. Chem. 251:3436-3441 (1976)] and in intact erythrocytes [ Blisard and Mieyal , J. Biol. Chem. 254:5104-5110 (1979)]. In this report, the monooxygenase activity of isolated hemoglobin (Hb) in the reconstituted system, which includes NADPH and cytochrome P-450 reductase, was shown to include N- and O-demethylation reactions besides p-hydroxylation, and to extend to other typical cytochrome P-450 substrates such as benzphetamine and p-nitroanisole. Some substrates were tested also with intact erythrocytes. Those which were metabolized displayed relative activities qualitatively similar to the pattern with isolated Hb. With isolated hemoglobin, complete kinetic analysis was carried out for 10 different reactions. The Km and Vmax values varied broadly, so that the efficiencies of the reactions (Vmax/Km) encompassed a range greater than 40,000. The most efficient reaction was O-demethylation of p-nitroanisole; the highest Vmax was observed for the O-demethylation of p-anisidine. The efficiencies (Vmax/Km) for a series of anisole derivatives (p-NH2,p-OH, p-H,p-NO2) was found to be quite sensitive to the electron-withdrawing effect of the p-substituent, i.e. a linear Hammett sigma rho relationship (log Vmax/Km versus sigma) was observed (p = 1.43). Metabolism of N-methylaniline by hemoglobin displayed distinct regioselectivity , with N-demethylation being favored over p-hydroxylation. Separate Km and Vmax values were observed for these two reactions of the single substrate, suggesting that distinct ternary O2-Hb-substrate complexes mediate the two reactions. In separate experiments, the various substrates were tested for their ability to accelerate autooxidation of HbO2 in the absence of NADPH and reductase. Aniline and its derivatives induced autooxidation with a concentration dependence matching their Km values for the corresponding hydroxylation reactions with the complete catalytic system. With the exception of p-hydroxyanisole, none of the other substrates accelerated autooxidation of HbO2. Hence this phenomenon cannot be an indicator of potential monooxygenase reactivity with hemoglobin. The broad and regioselective activities observed for hemoglobin resemble the characteristics of the authentic monooxygenase enzyme cytochrome P-450.	eng	467	475	Molecular pharmacology	25	3	1984	May		D000815;D003577;D004912/Q000201;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D006899;D010108/Q000378;D013329;D013379	Aniline Hydroxylase;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Mixed Function Oxygenases;Oxyhemoglobins/metabolism;Structure-Activity Relationship;Substrate Specificity	Starke DW;Blisard KS;Mieyal JJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
321	6597453	Prostaglandin-9-ketoreductase activity in erythrocytes of normal and hypertensive subjects.	The PGE2/PGF2 alpha balance, controlled in part by prostaglandin-9-ketoreductase, seems to be involved in the regulation of sodium excretion by the kidney. A decreased PGE2/PGF2 alpha ratio has been observed in the urine of hypertensive subjects. This suggests that an alteration of prostaglandin metabolism might be involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. In order to test this hypothesis, prostaglandin-9-ketoreductase (PG-9-KR) and prostaglandin-15-dehydrogenase (PG-15-DH) activities were measured in erythrocytes of normotensive controls and patients with essential hypertension. The two enzyme activities were highly correlated in the two groups, supporting the hypothesis that they are alternate expressions of a single enzyme. These two enzyme activities were not significantly different in hypertensive subjects as compared to controls. Human essential hypertension does not appear to be linked to a generalized defect of prostaglandin catabolic enzymes.	eng	255	266	Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and medicine	16	2	1984	Nov		D000328;D000368;D004232/Q000627;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D006911/Q000097;D006973/Q000097;D006973/Q000188;D006973/Q000201;D007700;D008297;D008875;D012016	Adult;Aged;Diuretics/therapeutic use;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases/blood;Hypertension/blood;Hypertension/drug therapy;Hypertension/enzymology;Kinetics;Male;Middle Aged;Reference Values	Leeman M;Vanherweghem JL;Galand N;Boeynaems JM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
322	6095974	Catalase: an old enzyme with a new role?	Although animal catalase has been studied for decades, its physiological role has remained perplexing. It has two enzymatic functions, not only catalyzing the breakdown of H2O2 into O2 and H2O, but also in the presence of low concentrations of H2O2 catalyzing the oxidation of electron donors such as ethanol or phenols. In this article, I have summarized some well-known properties of the enzyme and have also described several recently discovered features. Of particular interest is the finding that, although catalase has been regarded as an intracellular enzyme, there is published evidence for its association with the plasma membrane of the erythrocyte. Moreover, recent work from my laboratory indicates that in vitro at alkaline pH in the presence of Mg2+, the biologically active diphenols (beta-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and the beta-adrenergic agonists isoproterenol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) appear to function as electron donor substrates for human erythrocyte catalase and inhibit the production of O2 from H2O2 at micromolar concentrations. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol inhibits O2 production much less effectively and appears to competitively inhibit the reaction of catalase with epinephrine. These observations suggest an analogy between catalase and the beta-adrenergic hormone receptor and raise many questions of interest to basic science, health, and disease.	eng	1006	1014	Canadian journal of biochemistry and cell biology = Revue canadienne de biochimie et biologie cellulaire	62	10	1984	Oct		D000818;D002374/Q000235;D002374/Q000502;D004156/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D005786;D005979/Q000378;D006801;D006861/Q000378;D007668/Q000201;D007700;D008099/Q000201;D008837/Q000201;D008954;D011943/Q000378;D014018	Animals;Catalase/genetics;Catalase/physiology;Catechol Oxidase/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Gene Expression Regulation;Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism;Kidney/enzymology;Kinetics;Liver/enzymology;Micrococcus/enzymology;Models, Biological;Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/metabolism;Tissue Distribution	Percy ME	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
323	6088544	Metabolism of leukotriene A4 by human erythrocytes. A novel cellular source of leukotriene B4.	Human erythrocytes transformed leukotriene A4 into leukotriene B4. Metabolism was proportional to the erythrocyte concentration, even at subphysiological levels (0.08-4 X 10(9) erythrocytes/ml). Comparative metabolic studies excluded the possibility that leukotriene B4 originated from trace amounts of polymorphonuclear leukocytes or platelets present in the purified erythrocyte suspensions. For example, suspensions of isolated platelets (100-500 X 10(6) cells/ml) failed to convert leukotriene A4 into leukotriene B4; and conversion by suspensions of isolated polymorphonuclear neutrophils was insufficient to account for the amounts of leukotriene B4 formed by erythrocytes. Leukotriene B4 formation was maximal within 2 min and substrate concentration dependent. Enzymatic activity originated from a 56 degrees C labile nondialyzable (Mr greater than 30,000) soluble component in the 100,000 X g supernatant obtained from lysed erythrocytes. In contrast to the contemporary view, our results indicate that human erythrocytes are not metabolically inert in terms of eicosanoid biosynthesis. The role of human erythrocytes during inflammatory or pulmonary disorders deserves re-examination in this context.	eng	11403	11407	The Journal of biological chemistry	259	18	1984	Sep	25	D001095/Q000097;D002851;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007958;D017572;D007975/Q000097;D008954;D013056;D013237	Arachidonic Acids/blood;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Leukocyte Count;Leukotriene A4;Leukotriene B4/blood;Models, Biological;Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet;Stereoisomerism	Fitzpatrick F;Liggett W;McGee J;Bunting S;Morton D;Samuelsson B	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
324	6240986	[Degradative pathways of glucose 1,6-diphosphate in human erythrocytes].	In this study human erythrocytes have been incubated with various effectors most of which able to decrease the G1, 6P2 content. By using haemolysates and partially purified phosphoglucomutase isoenzymes we provide evidence that the G1, 6P2 decrease can be attributed to the ability of phosphoglucomutase PGM2 isoenzymes to mutate various sugar monophosphates. These isoenzymes, phosphorylated by G1, 6P2, may transfer the phosphate group to monophosphate sugars thus releasing the respective bisphosphate.	ita	1667	1669	Bollettino della Societa italiana di biologia sperimentale	60	9	1984	Sep	30	D000227/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D019298/Q000031;D005958/Q000097;D006801;D007527/Q000378;D010733/Q000378	Adenine Nucleotides/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose-6-Phosphate/analogs & derivatives;Glucosephosphates/blood;Humans;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Phosphoglucomutase/metabolism	Ninfali P;Piatti E;Palma F;Chiarantini L;Piacentini MP	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
325	2867869	S-Methylation of D- and L-penicillamine by human erythrocyte membrane thiol methyltransferase.	Human red blood cell (RBC) membranes contain a thiol methyltransferase activity that catalyzes the S-methylation of 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). These experiments were performed to determine whether human RBC membranes contain enzymes that can catalyze the S-methylation of D- and L-penicillamine, to determine whether those enzymes are similar to the RBC membrane thiol methyltransferase that catalyzes the S-methylation of 2-ME, and to determine whether lipophilic conjugates of the S-methyl metabolites of D- and L-penicillamine are formed by RBC membranes. Human RBC membranes were able to catalyze the S-methylation of D- and L-penicillamine. The apparent Michaelis (Km) constants for D- and L-penicillamine were 7.53 and 7.27 mM, respectively. However, the Vmax value for L-penicillamine was more than 2.5 times greater than the Vmax value for D-penicillamine. D- and L-Penicillamine methyltransferases and 2-ME thiol methyltransferase were similar with respect to their subcellular distributions, inhibitor sensitivities, and thermal stabilities. In addition, when methyltransferase activities for 2-ME and for D- and L-penicillamine were measured in RBC membranes from 19 individual subjects, there were highly significant correlations among all three activities (r greater than 0.98, p less than 0.001 for all three comparisons). These observations suggest either that a single enzyme in the human RBC membrane catalyzes the S-methylation of all three compounds, or, less likely, that these reactions are catalyzed by three separate enzymes that are regulated in parallel and have similar properties. Experiments were then performed to identify the products of the penicillamine methylation reactions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	eng	669	676	Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals	13	6	1985			D000328;D002851;D004910/Q000201;D006801;D006868;D066298;D007700;D008297;D008745;D008780/Q000097;D010396/Q000378;D013237;D013696	Adult;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Humans;Hydrolysis;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Male;Methylation;Methyltransferases/blood;Penicillamine/metabolism;Stereoisomerism;Temperature	Keith RA;Otterness DM;Kerremans AL;Weinshilboum RM	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
326	4072092	Metabolism of guanosine in human erythrocytes.	The metabolism of guanosine in human erythrocytes has been studied in two different experimental systems--direct incubation and dialysis incubation--the latter allowing continuous addition and removal of substances. Intra- and extracellular purine compounds were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). At 37 degrees C, a normal pH (7.4) and a favorably high concentration of inorganic phosphate, guanine nucleotides were synthesized at a substance rate of about 0.17 mmol . h-1 (calculated per liter erythrocytes) when guanosine was kept at a concentration of 25 mumol . l-1. At a higher guanosine concentration the rate of synthesis increased only moderately. Erythrocytes loaded with guanylates lost these nucleotides at a rate of 0.023 mmol . h-1 at a normal phosphate concentration and somewhat slower at a higher phosphate concentration. The metabolism kept the guanylates in an equilibrium that was similar to the equilibrium between the adenylates.	eng	72	83	Vox sanguinis	48	2	1985			D001786/Q000378;D001793/Q000379;D003956;D004734;D004912/Q000378;D006147/Q000097;D006151/Q000097;D006160/Q000097;D006801;D006863;D007773/Q000097;D013997	Blood Glucose/metabolism;Blood Preservation/methods;Dialysis;Energy Metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Guanine/blood;Guanosine/blood;Guanosine Triphosphate/blood;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Lactates/blood;Time Factors	Ericson A;Niklasson F;de Verdier CH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
327	3978172	Characteristics of phospholipid methylation in human erythrocyte ghosts: relationship(s) to the psychoses and affective disorders.	Recent studies have shown that patients with a schizophrenic-like illness have a significant deficit in erythrocyte ghost membrane (EGM) phosphatidylcholine (PC); patients with the most severe deficiency showed a marked decrease in Na+-Li+ counterflow activity (Hitzemann et al. 1984a and b). The present study was undertaken to see if the decrement in PC is associated with a decrease in phospholipid methylation activity. Phospholipid methylation in human EGMs is distinctly different from that in rat EGMs (Hirata and Axelrod 1980) in that the human activity is not Mg++-dependent, and apparent methyltransferase I activity is located in the external membrane surface. The patient population consisted of 20 DSM-III schizophrenics (SCZ), 13 DSM-III schizophreniform (SF) disorder patients, and 11 DSM-III manics (M). Twelve age- and sex-matched controls were used for the comparison group. Methylation activity was significantly decreased in all three patient groups, although the M group had significantly higher activity than the SF group. Twenty-four of the SCZ and SF patients entered a Li+ trial. The Li+ responder group (n = 8) showed significantly lower activity than the nonresponder group (n = 16). Overall, we conclude that the decrement in phospholipid methylation activity partially contributes to the decrement in PC levels.	eng	397	407	Biological psychiatry	20	4	1985	Apr		D000328;D001714/Q000188;D001714/Q000201;D004910/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008094/Q000627;D008274/Q000097;D008297;D008745;D008780/Q000097;D010713/Q000097;D010743/Q000097;D012559/Q000188;D012559/Q000201;D013109/Q000097	Adult;Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy;Bipolar Disorder/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Female;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Lithium/therapeutic use;Magnesium/blood;Male;Methylation;Methyltransferases/blood;Phosphatidylcholines/blood;Phospholipids/blood;Schizophrenia/drug therapy;Schizophrenia/enzymology;Sphingomyelins/blood	Hitzemann R;Mark C;Hirschowitz J;Garver D	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
328	4074664	Demethylation of protein carboxyl methyl esters: a nonenzymatic process in human erythrocytes?	We have compared the demethylation rate of protein carboxyl methyl esters from isolated human erythrocyte membranes with the corresponding rate of metabolic turnover of these same methyl groups in the intact erythrocyte. Surprisingly, the apparent spontaneous demethylation of these membrane protein methyl esters was significantly faster at physiological pH than the corresponding rate determined by pulse-chase analysis of intact cells incubated with L-[methyl-3H]methionine. Readdition of erythrocyte lysate to purified membranes did not increase the rate of demethylation, as might be expected if there were cytosolic or membrane-bound protein methylesterase activity, but resulted instead in an apparent stabilization of these methyl esters. Thus, the metabolic lability of these protein methyl esters in intact cells may be quantitatively explained by spontaneous, rather than enzymatic, demethylation reactions. A model is presented in which a rapid but nonenzymatic intramolecular demethylation reaction results in the formation of a polypeptide imide or anhydride intermediate. The metabolic fate of these hypothetical intermediates is unknown but may lead to the repair or degradation of protein D-aspartyl and L-isoaspartyl residues, which appear to be the substrates for the initial transmethylation reaction.	eng	4867	4871	Biochemistry	24	18	1985	Aug	27	D004910/Q000378;D004952;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008565/Q000097;D013329	Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Esters;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Membrane Proteins/blood;Structure-Activity Relationship	Barber JR;Clarke S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
329	2999273	Isozymes of human erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase.	A scheme for the partial purification of human erythrocyte pyrimidine nucleotidase isozymes is presented. The characteristics of three of these were distinctively established. One isozyme, designated pyrimidine nucleotidase (PyrNase), is active for uridine monophosphate (UMP) and cytidine monophosphate (CMP), but not for thymidine monophosphate (dTMP). Two other isozymes, designated thymidine nucleotidase I (ThyNase I) and thymidine nucleotidase II (ThyNase II), were active for dTMP, but less so for UMP and CMP. Molecular weights of PyrNase, ThyNase I, and ThyNase II were estimated as 52,000, 52,000, and 48,000, respectively. Isoelectric points of these isozymes were 5.22, 4.90, and 4.68, respectively. Kinetic study revealed that the Km value for dTMP of ThyNase I was 3.83 mmol/L and of ThyNase II was 6.26 mmol/L.	eng	646	650	The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine	106	6	1985	Dec		D015720;D002848;D002850;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007527/Q000097;D007527/Q000302;D007700;D008722;D008970;D009708/Q000097;D009708/Q000302;D013053	5'-Nucleotidase;Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose;Chromatography, Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Isoenzymes/blood;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Kinetics;Methods;Molecular Weight;Nucleotidases/blood;Nucleotidases/isolation & purification;Spectrophotometry	Oda T;Nagao M;Shirono K;Kagimoto T;Takatsuki K	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
330	4077987	Z-nucleotide accumulation in erythrocytes from Lesch-Nyhan patients.	5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside 5'-monophosphate (ZMP) is an intermediate in the purine de novo synthetic pathway that may be further metabolized to inosine 5'-monophosphate, degraded to the corresponding nucleoside (5-amino-4-imidazole-carboxamide riboside; Z-riboside), or phosphorylated to the corresponding 5'-triphosphate (ZTP). Accumulation of ZTP in microorganisms has been associated with depletion of folate intermediates that are necessary for the conversion of ZMP to inosine 5'-monophosphate and has been postulated to play a regulatory role in cellular metabolism. We have shown the presence of Z-nucleotides in erythrocytes derived from five individuals with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Erythrocyte folate levels were within the normal range, although guanosine triphosphate levels were significantly reduced below those in normal controls (P less than 0.01). A small amount of Z-nucleotide accumulation was also found in one individual with partial deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and in two individuals with other disorders of purine overproduction. In contrast, no Z-nucleotides were detected in 13 normal controls or in three individuals with hyperuricemia on allopurinol therapy. We conclude that Z-nucleotide formation may result from markedly increased rates of de novo purine biosynthesis. It is possible that metabolites of these purine intermediates may play a role in the pathogenesis of the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.	eng	2416	2419	The Journal of clinical investigation	76	6	1985	Dec		D000620/Q000031;D000620/Q000097;D000620/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006153/Q000097;D006160/Q000097;D006801;D007093/Q000097;D007926/Q000097;D007926/Q000378;D012265/Q000097;D012265/Q000378	Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/blood;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Guanosine Diphosphate/blood;Guanosine Triphosphate/blood;Humans;Imidazoles/blood;Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome/blood;Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome/metabolism;Ribonucleotides/blood;Ribonucleotides/metabolism	Sidi Y;Mitchell BS	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
331	2993713	Isozymes of human erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase--chromatographic separation and their properties.	The biochemical properties of two isozymes of human erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (P5N) separated by ion-exchange chromatography were studied. These two isozymes, P5N-I and P5N-IIB, can be distinguished from each other by substrate specificity, pH dependent activity and thermostability. P5N-I is thermolabile and dephosphorylates various pyrimidine 5'-monophosphates optimally around pH 7. UMP and CMP were found to be most effective substrates. P5N-IIB is thermostable and characterized by its high Michaelis constant and maximum velocity for dUMP or dTMP and acidic pH optima. The molecular weight was estimated to be 39,000 for P5N-I and 44,000 for P5N-IIB by gel filtration. These data suggest that these two isozymes are independent proteins and probably encoded by distinct structural gene loci.	eng	37	44	The Japanese journal of experimental medicine	55	1	1985	Feb		D015720;D002852;D004912/Q000201;D006358;D006801;D006863;D007527/Q000302;D007527/Q000378;D007700;D008970;D009708/Q000235;D009708/Q000302;D009708/Q000378;D011742/Q000378;D013379	5'-Nucleotidase;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Hot Temperature;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;Nucleotidases/genetics;Nucleotidases/isolation & purification;Nucleotidases/metabolism;Pyrimidine Nucleotides/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Hirono A;Fujii H;Miwa S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
332	3994659	On the nature of L-xylulose reductase deficiency in essential pentosuria.	Essential pentosuria is the result of a partial deficiency of L-xylulose reductase. Red blood cells of normal individuals have been found to contain two L-xylulose reductases: a major and a minor isozyme. Red cells from pentosurics contain only one isozyme. The residual enzyme of pentosurics and the normal minor isozyme have similar Michaelis constants for L-xylulose and xylitol, similar activity responses to pH, and similar rates of migration when electrophoresed or subjected to ion-exchange chromatography. It is suggested that homozygosity for the pentosuria allele results in the absence of the major isozyme and that the residual isozyme of pentosurics is identical to the minor isozyme of normal individuals.	eng	61	72	Biochemical genetics	23	1-2	1985	Feb		D000483;D002852;D004592;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007527/Q000097;D007527/Q000172;D007527/Q000235;D007585;D007700;D007861;D008297;D010375;D010429/Q000652;D013401/Q000097;D013401/Q000172;D013401/Q000235	Alleles;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Electrophoresis, Starch Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Isoenzymes/blood;Isoenzymes/deficiency;Isoenzymes/genetics;Jews;Kinetics;Lebanon;Male;Pedigree;Pentoses/urine;Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases/blood;Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases/deficiency;Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases/genetics	Lane AB	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;Red cell;Red blood cell	True
333	4028443	Human erythrocyte histamine N-methyltransferase: radiochemical microassay and biochemical properties.	A radiochemical assay for the measurement of histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) activity in human erythrocytes (RBCs) has been developed. This assay was developed as a first step toward testing the hypothesis that the biochemical properties and regulation of HNMT in an easily obtainable human cell, the RBC, might reflect those of the enzyme in less accessible cells and tissues. The Michaelis (Km) constant in the RBC for histamine, the methyl acceptor substrate for the reaction, was 5.0 X 10(-5) mol/l. The Km constant for S-adenosyl-L-methionine, the methyl donor, was 2.8 X 10(-6) mol/l. The assay was performed at a reaction pH of 7.4 with a potassium phosphate buffer. The product of the reaction was identified as N tau-methylhistamine by high performance liquid chromatography. The Kii for inhibition of the RBC enzyme by amodiaquine, an HNMT inhibitor, was 1.0 X 10(-7) mol/l, while the Kis value was 0.48 X 10(-7) mol/l. Blood samples obtained from 39 randomly selected adult white subjects had a mean activity of 130 +/- 30 U/ml of packed RBCs (mean +/- SD). Enzyme activities varied over a range from 74-213 U. There were no differences between men and women in mean activities, nor was there a significant correlation between RBC HNMT activity and age. The results of experiments in which lysates with 'low' and 'high' activities were mixed gave no indication that individual variations in RBC HNMT activities were due to the effects of endogenous enzyme inhibitors or activators. RBC HNMT activities measured in blood samples from 17 individual subjects four times over 6 wk were quite constant in each subject, with an average coefficient of variation of 6.2%. The availability of this assay will make it possible to test the hypothesis that individual variations in RBC HNMT activity might be used to predict individual differences in HNMT activity in other human cells and tissues.	eng	237	251	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	149	2-3	1985	Jul	15	D000328;D000368;D000655/Q000494;D001800;D004355;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006637/Q000037;D006637/Q000097;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008297;D008780/Q000097;D008832/Q000379;D008875;D010293/Q000494;D012016;D012436/Q000378;D014316	Adult;Aged;Amodiaquine/pharmacology;Blood Specimen Collection;Drug Stability;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Histamine N-Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors;Histamine N-Methyltransferase/blood;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Male;Methyltransferases/blood;Microchemistry/methods;Middle Aged;Pargyline/pharmacology;Reference Values;S-Adenosylmethionine/metabolism;Tritium	Van Loon JA;Pazmiño PA;Weinshilboum RM	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Partial deficiency of 6-phosphogluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.31) of the erythrocytes was discovered as an autosomal dominant disorder. Hemolytic anemia occurred in an individual who had inherited both the gene for 6-phosphogluconolactonase deficiency and that for deficiency of a nonhemolytic variant of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49).

In addition, the partial sequences of microsome-bound liver cytochrome b5, namely the sequence of the N-terminal region and joint region between the heme-containing and membranous part, have been established for human and porcine sources. All the cytochromes b5 from erythrocyte and liver contained N-acetylated N-termini. Of the 97 amino acid residues of erythrocyte cytochrome b5, residues 1-96 were identical with those of the liver protein of the same species. However, residue 97 (C-terminal residue) was proline for human erythrocyte cytochrome b5 and serine for the porcine protein, while residues 97 (joint region) of human and porcine liver cytochromes b5 were threonine. These findings indicate that the two forms of cytochrome b5 are encoded by two different but closely related mRNAs.	eng	1659	1668	Journal of biochemistry	97	6	1985	Jun		D000595;D000818;D002417;D002851;D003573/Q000097;D003573/Q000378;D015786;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008862/Q000201;D010446/Q000032;D013045;D013552;D014357	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Cattle;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cytochrome b Group/blood;Cytochrome b Group/metabolism;Cytochromes b5;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Microsomes, Liver/enzymology;Peptide Fragments/analysis;Species Specificity;Swine;Trypsin	Abe K;Kimura S;Kizawa R;Anan FK;Sugita Y	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
336	4005276	Transport of fatty acids across the membrane of human erythrocyte ghosts.	Human erythrocyte ghosts were used for studying the mechanism of uptake and membrane transport of fatty acids. Hemoglobin-free ghosts were prepared and loaded with substrates such as CoA and/or ATP, and their ability for transporting and activating radiolabelled palmitic acid was tested further. Uptake of radiolabelled palmitic acid by CoA- and ATP-loaded ghosts exceeded that observed with ghosts loaded only with ATP, the latter being greater than that measured with non-loaded ghosts. Acyl-CoA was synthesized in CoA- and ATP-loaded ghosts upon incubation with radiolabelled palmitic acid. Both CoA and ATP were needed within the ghosts to permit acyl-CoA synthesis, suggesting that the acyl-CoA synthetase is located in and is bound to the inner layer of the membrane. The rate of acyl-CoA synthesis was saturable with increasing concentration of palmitic acid in the incubation mixture, and kinetic parameters were calculated. The rate of acyl-CoA synthesis in CoA- and ATP-loaded ghosts upon incubation with radiolabelled palmitic acid was markedly decreased when increasing albumin concentration in the incubation medium up to a molar ratio albumin/fatty acid of one to one. It is not easy to distinguish experimentally fatty acids located in the outer layer and the inner layer of the membrane and the data of this paper suggest that acyl-CoA synthesis by an enzyme located in the inner layer could be used as a measure of the acyl groups which have been translocated across the membrane of erythrocyte ghosts.	eng	68	76	Biochimica et biophysica acta	835	1	1985	Jun	14	D000214/Q000096;D000255/Q000378;D000418/Q000494;D001693;D003065/Q000378;D004229/Q000494;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D005227/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D019308;D010169/Q000378	Acyl Coenzyme A/biosynthesis;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Albumins/pharmacology;Biological Transport, Active;Coenzyme A/metabolism;Dithiothreitol/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Fatty Acids/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Palmitic Acid;Palmitic Acids/metabolism	Morand O;Aigrot MS	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
337	3157431	Glucose 1,6-bisphosphate decline in human erythrocytes: possible involvement of phosphoglucomutase PGM2 isoenzymes.	Human erythrocytes incubated with various sugars lower their glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (Glc-1,6-P2) content, as do haemolysates containing exogenous Glc-1,6-P2 incubated with sugar monophosphates (sugar-P). Experiments performed with isolated erythrocyte phosphoglucomutase (PGM) isoenzymes indicate that only definite isoenzymatic forms, namely PGM2, are able to consume Glc-1,6-P2 during the mutation of sugar-P other than glucose-P. In this process a phosphate group is released from Glc-1,6-P2 and can be partially recovered in the biphosphate of the mutated sugar-P. The relevance of this mechanism of Glc-1,6-P2 degradation is discussed in regard to the physiological turnover of the biphosphate.	eng	162	166	Canadian journal of biochemistry and cell biology = Revue canadienne de biochimie et biologie cellulaire	63	3	1985	Mar		D000227/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D019298/Q000031;D005958/Q000097;D006801;D007527/Q000097;D010733/Q000097;D012267/Q000097;D013403/Q000097	Adenine Nucleotides/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose-6-Phosphate/analogs & derivatives;Glucosephosphates/blood;Humans;Isoenzymes/blood;Phosphoglucomutase/blood;Ribosemonophosphates/blood;Sugar Phosphates/blood	Ninfali P;Piatti E;Accorsi A;Palma F;Fazi A;Tozzi MG;Fornaini G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
338	3919011	Discrimination of Na+-independent transport systems L, T, and asc in erythrocytes. Na+ independence of the latter a consequence of cell maturation?	On the basis of inhibition analysis two bicyclic amino acid analogs appear to enter human red blood cells by much the same Na+-independent mediation, whereas striking differences are apparent in the routes for tryptophan and leucine, confirming a role for System T, but also suggesting the participation of a third system of low affinity somewhat selective for weakly basic amino acids. System T of the human cell is specifically inhibited by 4-azidophenylalanine, and is highly sensitive, relative to System L, to N-ethylmaleimide inhibition. Uptake by System T approaches its steady state much more slowly than does System L, and its participation in trans-stimulation is questionable, whereas that of System L is as usual strong. A different added transport system became apparent in the slow approach of the Na+-independent mediation of uptake of 3- and 4-carbon dipolar amino acids by the nucleated pigeon red cell to its steady state. In that cell System T makes at most a minor contribution. The patterns of trans-stimulation of fluxes among selected pairs of amino acids in the pigeon cell correspond to a usual participation in transmembrane exchange by System L, and also by the new transport system. An important but not the sole source of the heterogeneity in the pigeon cell is the participation of the system conspicuously involved in the transport of alanine, serine, and threonine, among other amino acids. This route of transport of these amino acids is made conspicuous by their small transport by other Na+-independent agencies, notably System L. Reactivity with this system is enhanced by a side change hydroxyl or sulfhydryl group. Uptake by this route as tested by threonine showed little inhibition by cysteinesulfinate under conditions inhibitory to System asc; also a sensitivity to lowering of pH unlike that seen with System asc. The new Na+-dependent transport system appears to be a species variant of quite similar Na+-independent systems discovered by Young et al. (Young, J. D., Ellory, J. C., and Tucker, E. M. (1975) Nature (Lond.) 254, 156-157; Fincham, D. A., Mason, D. K., and Young, J. D. (1982) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 11, 776-777) in sheep and horse erythrocytes on the basis of their absence in phenotypes. These authors have emphasized several similarities in these two cases to Na+-dependent System asc, and they propose that Na+ dependence has specifically been lost on maturation of the red cells without major changes in amino acid selectivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	eng	2912	2921	The Journal of biological chemistry	260	5	1985	Mar	10	D000596/Q000097;D001693;D004905;D004912/Q000378;D005033/Q000494;D005973/Q000097;D006639/Q000097;D006801;D006863;D007930/Q000097;D012964/Q000097;D013912/Q000097;D014364/Q000097;D014443/Q000097	Amino Acids/blood;Biological Transport, Active;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology;Glutamine/blood;Histidine/blood;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Leucine/blood;Sodium/blood;Threonine/blood;Tryptophan/blood;Tyrosine/blood	Vadgama JV;Christensen HN	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
339	3922304	Purification and properties of aldose reductase and aldehyde reductase II from human erythrocyte.	Aldose reductase (EC 1.1.1.21) and aldehyde reductase II (L-hexonate dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.2) have been purified to homogeneity from human erythrocytes by using ion-exchange chromatography, chromatofocusing, affinity chromatography, and Sephadex gel filtration. Both enzymes are monomeric, Mr 32,500, by the criteria of the Sephadex gel filtration and polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The isoelectric pH's for aldose reductase and aldehyde reductase II were determined to be 5.47 and 5.06, respectively. Substrate specificity studies showed that aldose reductase, besides catalyzing the reduction of various aldehydes such as propionaldehyde, pyridine-3-aldehyde and glyceraldehyde, utilizes aldo-sugars such as glucose and galactose. Aldehyde reductase II, however, did not use aldo-sugars as substrate. Aldose reductase activity is expressed with either NADH or NADPH as cofactors, whereas aldehyde reductase II can utilize only NADPH. The pH optima for aldose reductase and aldehyde reductase II are 6.2 and 7.0, respectively. Both enzymes are susceptible to the inhibition by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide. They are also inhibited to varying degrees by aldose reductase inhibitors such as sorbinil, alrestatin, quercetrin, tetramethylene glutaric acid, and sodium phenobarbital. The presence of 0.4 M lithium sulfate in the assay mixture is essential for the full expression of aldose reductase activity whereas it completely inhibits aldehyde reductase II. Amino acid compositions and immunological studies further show that erythrocyte aldose reductase is similar to human and bovine lens aldose reductase, and that aldehyde reductase II is similar to human liver and brain aldehyde reductase II.	eng	670	679	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics	238	2	1985	May	01	D000449/Q000097;D000596/Q000032;D002237/Q000097;D002848;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D066298;D007700;D008970;D009249/Q000494;D011487;D013379;D013401/Q000097;D013816	Aldehyde Reductase/blood;Amino Acids/analysis;Carbohydrate Dehydrogenases/blood;Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;NADP/pharmacology;Protein Conformation;Substrate Specificity;Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases/blood;Thermodynamics	Das B;Srivastava SK	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
340	3932573	Limiting role of 6-phosphogluconolactonase in erythrocyte hexose monophosphate pathway metabolism.	The natural product of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction is 6-phosphoglucono-delta-lactone, which must be hydrolyzed to 6-phosphogluconic acid before it can be further metabolized by 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Because this lactone is very unstable, it has been uncertain whether the enzyme that hydrolyzes it, 6-phosphogluconolactonase, is required for functioning of the hexose monophosphate pathway. We have purified glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconolactonase, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes to the point where each enzyme is essentially free of each of the other activities. We constructed an artificial hexose monophosphate pathway from these enzymes, providing as substrate 14C-labeled glucose-6-phosphate either directly or by continual generation from 14C-glucose by yeast hexokinase and adenosine triphosphate. The oxidation of 6-phosphogluconic acid was estimated by measuring the CO2 formed. In the absence of a reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidizing system, such as oxidized glutathione (GSSG)-glutathione reductase or phenazine methosulfate, little CO2 was formed, and the presence of 6-phosphogluconolactonase did not affect the amount that was produced. When the hexose monophosphate pathway was stimulated by providing an NADPH-oxidizing system, CO2 was produced two and a half to five times as fast in the presence of 6-phosphogluconolactonase as in its absence. These studies suggest that 6-phosphogluconolactonase is required for the functioning of the hexose monophosphate pathway when the rate of oxidation of NADPH is accelerated.	eng	573	577	The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine	106	5	1985	Nov		D002245/Q000097;D002265/Q000097;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D005942/Q000097;D019298;D005954/Q000097;D005958/Q000097;D006600/Q000097;D006801;D007700;D009249/Q000097;D010084;D010734/Q000097	Carbon Dioxide/blood;Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/blood;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Gluconates/blood;Glucose-6-Phosphate;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/blood;Glucosephosphates/blood;Hexosephosphates/blood;Humans;Kinetics;NADP/blood;Oxidation-Reduction;Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase/blood	Beutler E;Kuhl W	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
341	3933003	Activated and unactivated forms of human erythrocyte aldose reductase.	Aldose reductase (alditol:NADP+ 1-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.21) has been partially purified from human erythrocytes by DEAE-cellulose (DE-52) column chromatography. This enzyme is activated severalfold upon incubation with 10 microM each glucose 6-phosphate, NADPH, and glucose. The activation of the enzyme was confirmed by following the oxidation of NADPH as well as the formation of sorbitol with glucose as substrate. The activated form of aldose reductase exhibited monophasic kinetics with both glyceraldehyde and glucose (Km of glucose = 0.68 mM and Km of glyceraldehyde = 0.096 mM), whereas the native (unactivated) enzyme exhibited biphasic kinetics (Km of glucose = 9.0 and 0.9 mM and Km of glyceraldehyde = 1.1 and 0.14 mM). The unactivated enzyme was strongly inhibited by aldose reductase inhibitors such as sorbinil, alrestatin, and quercetrin, and by phosphorylated intermediates such as ADP, glycerate 3-phosphate, glycerate 1,3-bisphosphate, and glycerate 2,3-trisphosphate. The activated form of the enzyme was less susceptible to inhibition by aldose reductase inhibitors and phosphorylated intermediates.	eng	7222	7226	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	82	21	1985	Nov		D000449/Q000037;D000449/Q000302;D000449/Q000378;D003920/Q000378;D004789;D004912/Q000201;D005947/Q000378;D005985/Q000378;D006801;D007093/Q000494;D048289;D007546/Q000494;D007700;D009249/Q000378;D011794/Q000031;D011794/Q000494;D013012/Q000096;D013401/Q000378	Aldehyde Reductase/antagonists & inhibitors;Aldehyde Reductase/isolation & purification;Aldehyde Reductase/metabolism;Diabetes Mellitus/metabolism;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glucose/metabolism;Glyceraldehyde/metabolism;Humans;Imidazoles/pharmacology;Imidazolidines;Isoquinolines/pharmacology;Kinetics;NADP/metabolism;Quercetin/analogs & derivatives;Quercetin/pharmacology;Sorbitol/biosynthesis;Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases/metabolism	Srivastava SK;Hair GA;Das B	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
342	4065333	Erythrocyte membrane acyl:CoA synthetase activity.	The presence of long-chain acyl:CoA synthetases in mammalian microsomes and mitochondria has been established previously [(1971) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 231, 32-47]. The presence of a plasma membrane-associated enzyme was investigated in human erythrocyte ghost plasma membranes, where an enzyme exhibiting high activity, and with a preferred substrate of 18 carbon chain length, was discovered. The results are consistent with the presence of a single enzyme. The effect of the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid substrates was not as pronounced as that arising from the length of the carbon chain. The pattern of substrate preference of the enzyme was omega 3 polyenoics greater than omega 6 polyenoics greater than omega 9 monoenoics greater than saturated fatty acids. This may relate to the similar substrate preference pattern exhibited by the fatty acyl desaturase enzymes. However, the role played by long-chain acyl:CoA synthetase in erythrocyte metabolism is uncertain, but may relate to the transportation of polyenoic fatty acids in the circulation.	eng	69	74	FEBS letters	193	1	1985	Nov	25	D000214/Q000378;D004910/Q000201;D005227/Q000378;D006801	Acyl Coenzyme A/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Fatty Acids/metabolism;Humans	Davidson BC;Cantrill RC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
343	3866141	Phosphorylation of membrane proteins by cytosolic casein kinases in human erythrocytes. Effect of monovalent ions, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and spermine.	Membrane proteins of human erythrocytes can be phosphorylated not only by membrane casein kinase (MS) but also by cytosolic casein kinases CS and CTS, resembling casein kinase I and II, respectively. Casein kinase CS, like membrane casein kinase MS, preferentially phosphorylates membrane proteins such as band 2 (spectrin, beta-subunit) and band 3, which are the major phosphate-acceptor proteins in the endogenous phosphorylation of isolated ghosts in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP. By contrast, cytosolic casein kinase CTS phosphorylates, in addition to band 2, some membrane proteins, whose endogenous phosphorylation in isolated ghosts under the same conditions is negligible, if any. The CS- and CTS-catalyzed phosphorylations exhibit different response to increasing NaCl (or KCl) concentrations up to physiological levels (140 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl); i.e. CS- and MS-catalyzed phosphorylations are strongly inhibited by 75-150 mM KCl (or NaCl), while CTS-catalyzed phosphorylation is practically unaffected. In the absence of added NaCl, CS- and MS-catalyzed phosphorylations are markedly inhibited by 1.5-3 mM 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, whereas CTS-catalyzed phosphorylation appears to be practically unaffected. Finally, CS- and MS-catalyzed phosphorylations are slightly inhibited also by 1 mM spermine, while CTS-catalyzed phosphorylation is enhanced by this polycation concentration.	eng	181	187	Molecular and cellular biochemistry	68	2	1985	Oct		D019794;D047388;D002414/Q000494;D003600/Q000201;D004163/Q000494;D004591;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D008565/Q000097;D010766;D011494/Q000097;D012965/Q000494;D013096/Q000494	2,3-Diphosphoglycerate;Casein Kinases;Cations, Monovalent/pharmacology;Cytosol/enzymology;Diphosphoglyceric Acids/pharmacology;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Membrane Proteins/blood;Phosphorylation;Protein Kinases/blood;Sodium Chloride/pharmacology;Spermine/pharmacology	Clari G;Moret V	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
344	2995393	Enzymatic hydration of leukotriene A4. Purification and characterization of a novel epoxide hydrolase from human erythrocytes.	Human erythrocytes contained a soluble cytosolic epoxide hydrolase for stereospecific enzymatic hydration of leukotriene A4 into leukotriene B4. The enzyme was purified 1100-fold, to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity, by conventional DEAE-Sephacel fractionation followed by high performance anion exchange and chromatofocusing procedures. Its characteristics include a molecular weight of 54,000 +/- 1,000, an isoelectric point 4.9 +/- 0.2, a Km apparent from 7 to 36 microM for enzymatic hydration of leukotriene A4, and a pH optimum ranging from 7 to 8. The enzyme was partially inactivated by its initial exposure to leukotriene A4. There was slow but detectable enzymatic hydration (pmol/min/mg) of certain arachidonic acid epoxides including (+/-)-14,15-oxido-5,8-11-eicosatrienoic acid and (+/-)-11,12-oxido-5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid, but not others, including 5,6-oxido-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid. Human erythrocyte epoxide hydrolase did not hydrate either styrene oxide or trans-stilbene oxide. In terms of its physical properties and substrate preference for leukotriene A4, the erythrocyte enzyme differs from previously described versions of epoxide hydrolase. Human erythrocytes represent a novel source for an extrahepatic, cytosolic epoxide hydrolase with a potential physiological role.	eng	12832	12837	The Journal of biological chemistry	260	23	1985	Oct	15	D015126/Q000031;D015126/Q000378;D001095/Q000378;D001095/Q000494;D002845;D003600/Q000201;D004591;D004851/Q000037;D004851/Q000097;D004851/Q000302;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007526;D017572;D007975/Q000378;D008970;D013267/Q000494;D013379	8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic Acid/analogs & derivatives;8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic Acid/metabolism;Arachidonic Acids/metabolism;Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology;Chromatography;Cytosol/enzymology;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors;Epoxide Hydrolases/blood;Epoxide Hydrolases/isolation & purification;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Isoelectric Point;Leukotriene A4;Leukotriene B4/metabolism;Molecular Weight;Stilbenes/pharmacology;Substrate Specificity	McGee J;Fitzpatrick F	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

347	3732224	Purification and properties of NADH-specific dihydropteridine reductase from human erythrocytes.	NADH-specific dihydropteridine reductase (EC 1.6.99.7) has been purified from human erythrocytes in essentially homogeneous form. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 46,000 by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration. The enzyme reacted with antiserum against NADH-specific dihydropteridine reductase from bovine liver and formed a single immunoprecipitin line in the Ouchterlony double-diffusion system. This precipitin line completely fused with that formed between the human liver enzyme and the antiserum. With use of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-6-methylpterin, Km values of the erythrocyte enzyme for NADH and NADPH were determined to be 0.94 and 47 mumol/l, respectively. Vmax values were 58.7 mumol/min/mg with NADH and 6.41 mumol/min/mg with NADPH. The average activity of NADH-specific dihydropteridine reductase of 9 human blood samples from healthy males (20-25 years old) was calculated to be approximately 600 mU/g of hemoglobin, 1.8 mU per 20 microliters of blood, or 1.9 mU per 10(8) erythrocytes.	eng	42	52	Enzyme	35	1	1986			D000328;D004093/Q000097;D004093/Q000302;D004093/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D007962/Q000201;D008297;D008970;D009243/Q000378;D009247/Q000097;D009249/Q000378	Adult;Dihydropteridine Reductase/blood;Dihydropteridine Reductase/isolation & purification;Dihydropteridine Reductase/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Leukocytes/enzymology;Male;Molecular Weight;NAD/metabolism;NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/blood;NADP/metabolism	Nakanishi N;Yoshida A;Ozawa K;Yamada S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Using gel filtration column chromatography of hemolysates from patients receiving CsA orally, the majority of erythrocyte-associated CsA eluted as a single peak with Mr 15,000-17,000, distinct from hemoglobin and carbonic anhydrase. [3H]CsA added to a hemolysate in vitro eluted similarly. [125I]CsA added to a hemolysate eluted much later in the same position as [3H]CsA mixed with albumin and myoglobin (presumably as free unbound drug). These findings indicate that CsA normally binds to an intraerythrocytic protein similar in molecular size to calf thymus cyclophilin (Mr 15,000). By equilibrium dialysis, the purified erythrocyte proteins calmodulin (Mr 16,700) and cytochrome b5 (Mr 15,000) failed to bind CsA. By equilibrium dialysis, [3H] CsA did bind to column fractions containing the CsA-binding protein, but [125I]CsA did not, suggesting that attachment to CsA occurs at or near a carbon-carbon double bond in an unusual nine-carbon amino acid of CsA. These results have important implications for CsA therapy with regard to distribution space, pharmacokinetics, and a possible protein-receptor mechanism of action.	eng	627	632	Transplantation	42	6	1986	Dec		D002352/Q000097;D002850;D003524/Q000097;D003956;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D019696	Carrier Proteins/blood;Chromatography, Gel;Cyclosporins/blood;Dialysis;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Peptidylprolyl Isomerase	Agarwal RP;McPherson RA;Threatte GA	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
349	3026468	A new acylphosphatase isoenzyme from human erythrocytes: purification, characterization, and primary structure.	A new acylphosphatase from human erythrocytes was isolated by an original purification procedure. It is an isoenzyme of the well-characterized human skeletal muscle acylphosphatase. The erythrocyte enzyme shows hydrolytic activity on acyl phosphates with higher affinity than the muscle enzyme for some substrates and phosphorylated inhibitors. The sequence was determined by characterizing the peptides purified from tryptic, peptic, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digests of the protein, and it was found to differ in 44% of the total positions as compared to the human muscle enzyme. About one-third of these differences are in the form of strictly conservative replacements. The protein consists of 98 amino acid residues; it has an acetylated NH2-terminus and does not contain cysteine: (sequence in text).	eng	8089	8094	Biochemistry	25	24	1986	Dec	02	D017766;D000595;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007527/Q000097;D007527/Q000302;D007700;D013058;D009132/Q000201;D010446;D010744/Q000097;D010744/Q000302;D000097024	Acid Anhydride Hydrolases;Amino Acid Sequence;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Isoenzymes/blood;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Kinetics;Mass Spectrometry;Muscles/enzymology;Peptide Fragments;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/blood;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/isolation & purification;Acylphosphatase	Liguri G;Camici G;Manao G;Cappugi G;Nassi P;Modesti A;Ramponi G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
350	3456572	A sialic acid-specific O-acetylesterase in human erythrocytes: possible identity with esterase D, the genetic marker of retinoblastomas and Wilson disease.	"The ""nonspecific"" esterases are a family of enzymes that were originally identified because of their reaction with synthetic O-acetyl ester substrates. While the electrophoretic polymorphisms of these enzymes have been extremely useful for genetic studies, their biological functions have remained completely unknown. Esterase D is characterized by its reactivity with 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate. This enzyme has recently been of particular interest because of its tight linkage to the putative recessive gene causing retinoblastomas, and to the recessive gene causing Wilson disease. We describe here the partial purification of a human erythrocyte esterase that appears to be highly specific for O-acetylated sialic acids. We next present evidence that suggests that esterase D is identical to this sialic acid-specific O-acetylesterase. First, both activities copurify from human erythrocyte lysates through several different purification steps, each of which use different principles of separation. Second, both activities show a remarkably similar profile of inhibition with a variety of different agents. Third, they both show a nearly identical heat-inactivation profile. This cytosolic sialic acid-specific O-acetylesterase appears to be involved in the ""recycling"" of O-acetylated sialic acid molecules. Thus, esterase D may be the first nonspecific esterase for which a specific biological role can be predicted."	eng	882	886	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	83	4	1986	Feb		D000115;D043182;D002265/Q000037;D002265/Q000302;D002265/Q000378;D004789;D004912/Q000201;D005134/Q000201;D006527/Q000201;D006358;D006801;D012175/Q000201;D014468/Q000378	Acetylesterase;Carboxylesterase;Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors;Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/isolation & purification;Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Eye Neoplasms/enzymology;Hepatolenticular Degeneration/enzymology;Hot Temperature;Humans;Retinoblastoma/enzymology;Umbelliferones/metabolism	Varki A;Muchmore E;Diaz S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
351	3510133	Structure of the human erythrocyte insulin receptor.	The structure of the insulin receptor in intact human erythrocytes was defined using the techniques of disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) cross-linking of 125I-insulin and surface [125I]iodination followed by receptor immunoprecipitation. In contrast to a recent report, we found the erythrocyte insulin receptor to be similar in structure to that in classic target tissues for insulin, consisting of at least three species of molecular weight approximately 295,000, 265,000, and 245,000, containing disulfide-linked subunits of molecular weight approximately 130,000 and 95,000. The interconversion of the three oligomeric forms could mediate changes in receptor affinity as postulated in other tissues. The 95,000 subunit was detected by immunoprecipitation only if surface iodination was performed in a Tris/Hepes buffer using lodogen and not if phosphate-buffered saline or lactoperoxidase iodination was used. These findings indicate that the lack of a bioeffect of insulin in erythrocytes is not explained by a gross defect in the structure of their insulin receptors. The apparent identity of the insulin receptor structure in erythrocytes and insulin target tissues provides a firmer basis for the use of erythrocytes in some circumstances to reflect insulin receptor status.	eng	101	105	Diabetes	35	1	1986	Jan		D000328;D004591;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007328/Q000378;D008970;D011972/Q000378;D013388	Adult;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Insulin/metabolism;Molecular Weight;Receptor, Insulin/metabolism;Succinimides	Ward GM;Harrison LC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
352	3941079	Metabolism of a synthetic L-isoaspartyl-containing hexapeptide in erythrocyte extracts. Enzymatic methyl esterification is followed by nonenzymatic succinimide formation.	The synthetic peptide, L-Val-L-Tyr-L-Pro-L-isoAsp-Gly-L-Ala, is a substrate for the erythrocyte and brain protein carboxyl methyltransferases. These enzymes catalyze the methyl esterification of the free alpha-carboxyl group of the isoaspartyl residue, to which the glycyl residue is linked through the side chain beta-carboxyl group. In this work, we show that the alpha-methyl ester of this peptide was rapidly demethylated (t1/2 = 4 min at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4) in erythrocyte cytosolic extracts and that the product of this reaction appears to be the succinimide ring derivative of the peptide. The rate of demethylation, measured at either pH 6.0 or 7.4, was the same in buffer and erythrocyte extracts, suggesting that succinimide formation was a nonenzymatic reaction. The L-succinimide is more stable than the ester, but can be hydrolyzed in buffer at pH 7.4 (t1/2 = 180 min at 37 degrees C) to give a mixture of about 75% isoaspartyl peptide and 25% normal aspartyl peptide. The metabolism of the succinimide hexapeptide in erythrocyte extracts appears to be more complex, however. The implications of this work for the methylation and demethylation of cellular proteins containing structurally altered aspartyl residues are discussed.	eng	306	312	The Journal of biological chemistry	261	1	1986	Jan	05	D055598;D002621;D002851;D003600/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D008433;D008745;D009842/Q000378;D013388/Q000378	Chemical Phenomena;Chemistry;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cytosol/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Mathematics;Methylation;Oligopeptides/metabolism;Succinimides/metabolism	Murray ED;Clarke S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
353	2418829	The human red cell acid phosphatase is a phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase which dephosphorylates the membrane protein band 3.	Human red cell cytosol acid phosphatase activity is supported by a main enzyme which can be extracted by DEAE and phosphocellulose chromatography. It uses pNPP as a substrate and is a protein phosphatase specific to phosphotyrosine. It dephosphorylates the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytosolic fragment of membrane protein 3. When taken together, these results suggest that the physiological role of red cell acid phosphatase is the FB3 phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation. Whatever it may be phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase activity is the first role of red cell acid phosphatase to be demonstrated.	eng	557	564	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	134	2	1986	Jan	29	D000135/Q000097;D001457/Q000378;D003600/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D010749/Q000378;D019000;D014443/Q000031;D014443/Q000378	Acid Phosphatase/blood;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism;Phosphotyrosine;Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives;Tyrosine/metabolism	Boivin P;Galand C	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True
354	3089282	Purification and characterization of, and preparation of an antibody to, transketolase from human red blood cells.	Transketolase (sedoheptulose-7-phosphate: D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate glycolaldehydetransferase, EC 2.2.1.1) was purified 16 000-fold from human red blood cells, using DEAE-Sephadex A-50, Sephadex G-150, FPLC on Mono P, and Sephadex G-100. The purified enzyme migrated as a single protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The FPLC step resolved transketolase into three peaks, designated I, II and III. From results of re-FPLC on Mono P, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, catalytic studies, amino acid analysis and immunological studies, it was concluded that I, II and III were originally the same protein, modified during storage and purification. Transketolase had a subunit (Mr 70 000) and appeared to be composed of two identical subunits. 1 mol of subunit contained 0.9 mol of thiamine pyrophosphate. The pH optimum of the reaction lay within the range 7.6-8.0, and the Km values were determined to be 1.5 X 10(-4) M for xylulose 5-phosphate and 4.0 X 10(-4) M for ribose 5-phosphate. Hg2+ and p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibited the enzyme reaction, and the inhibition of the latter disappeared upon the addition of cysteine. Thiamine and its phosphate esters did not, but cysteine (1 X 10(-2) M) and ethanol (10% and 1% v/v) did activate the enzyme reaction. Antibody prepared to II bound all forms of transketolase in the hemolysate, but inhibited the reaction only about 20%.	eng	24	32	Biochimica et biophysica acta	872	1-2	1986	Jul	25	D000596/Q000032;D000906;D002850;D002852;D004591;D004912/Q000201;D006461;D006801;D005779;D007074/Q000276;D007526;D008670/Q000494;D008970;D014174/Q000276;D014174/Q000302	Amino Acids/analysis;Antibodies;Chromatography, Gel;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Hemolysis;Humans;Immunodiffusion;Immunoglobulin G/immunology;Isoelectric Point;Metals/pharmacology;Molecular Weight;Transketolase/immunology;Transketolase/isolation & purification	Takeuchi T;Nishino K;Itokawa Y	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True

356	3006048	Erythrocyte-neutrophil interactions: formation of leukotriene B4 by transcellular biosynthesis.	"Studies on the mechanism of leukotriene B4 biosynthesis in suspensions composed of neutrophils plus erythrocytes indicate that human erythrocytes convert neutrophil-derived leukotriene A4 into leukotriene B4. Leukotriene B4 formation by neutrophils in the presence of erythrocytes exceeded that from corresponding suspensions of neutrophils alone. The increase was proportional to the erythrocyte content of the suspension. The erythrocyte-dependent increase in leukotriene B4 biosynthesis did not equal the arithmetic sum of calcium ionophore-dependent biosynthesis by neutrophils plus calcium ionophore-dependent biosynthesis by erythrocytes, since erythrocytes produced no leukotriene B4 upon incubation with ionophore A23187. Erythrocytes did not stimulate 5-lipoxygenase activity within neutrophils, since the erythrocyte effect was confined to enzymatic hydration: leukotriene B4 increased coincident with decreased formation of 5,12-dihydroxyicosatetraenoic acids derived from nonenzymatic hydration. Biosynthesis of leukotriene B4 within the erythrocyte, from neutrophil-derived leukotriene A4, was established by comparing the effect of normal erythrocytes with erythrocytes containing a leukotriene A4 hydrolase that was inactivated by the substrate. In the latter case, leukotriene B4 formation increased by only 30-40%; in the former case, it increased by 100-200%. Transcellular biosynthesis of leukotriene B4 from erythrocyte-neutrophil interactions explains the paradoxical presence of leukotriene A4 hydrolase within erythrocytes, a cell incapable of synthesizing leukotriene A4; affords a mechanism to overcome rate limitations or ""suicide inactivation"" of leukotriene A4 hydrolase in neutrophils; exploits a cryptic capacity within erythrocytes, provisionally dormant cells in terms of icosanoid biosynthesis; indicates that the biosynthetic capacity of cell combinations is not necessarily equivalent to the sum of their separate capacities."	eng	1349	1353	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	83	5	1986	Mar		D001095/Q000097;D000001/Q000494;D002851;D004912/Q000502;D006801;D066298;D007536;D017572;D007975/Q000097;D009504/Q000502	Arachidonic Acids/blood;Calcimycin/pharmacology;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/physiology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Isomerism;Leukotriene A4;Leukotriene B4/blood;Neutrophils/physiology	McGee JE;Fitzpatrick FA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
357	3949980	Pathways of adenine nucleotide catabolism in erythrocytes.	The exact pathway whereby the initial catabolism of the adenine nucleotides proceeds from AMP and the possibility of a recycling of adenosine were investigated in human erythrocytes. Adenine nucleotide catabolism, reflected by the production of hypoxanthine, is very slow under physiologic conditions and can be greatly increased by suppression of glucose or alkalinization of the medium. Experiments with inhibitors of adenosine deaminase and adenosine kinase demonstrated that under physiologic conditions the initial catabolism of AMP proceeds by way of a deamination of AMP, followed by dephosphorylation of inosine monophosphate, and that no recycling occurs between AMP and adenosine. Under glucose deprivation, approximately 75% of the 20-fold increase of the catabolism of the adenine nucleotides proceeded by way of a dephosphorylation of AMP followed by deamination of adenosine, and a small recycling of this nucleoside could be evidenced. Inhibition of adenosine transport showed that the dephosphorylation of AMP occurred intracellularly. When the incubation medium was alkalinized in the presence of glucose, the 15-fold increase in the conversion of AMP to hypoxanthine proceeded exclusively by way of AMP deaminase but a small recycling of adenosine could also be evidenced. The threefold elevation of intraerythrocytic inorganic phosphate (Pi) during glucose deprivation and its 50% decrease during alkalinization as well as experiments in which extracellular Pi was modified, indicate that the dephosphorylation of red blood cell AMP is mainly responsive to variations of AMP, whereas its deamination is more sensitive to Pi.	eng	824	830	The Journal of clinical investigation	77	3	1986	Mar		D000227/Q000097;D000241/Q000097;D001639/Q000097;D001786/Q000378;D004163/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D066298;D007700;D010710/Q000097;D010879/Q000494	Adenine Nucleotides/blood;Adenosine/blood;Bicarbonates/blood;Blood Glucose/metabolism;Diphosphoglyceric Acids/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Phosphates/blood;Piperazines/pharmacology	Bontemps F;Van den Berghe G;Hers HG	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte;erythro	True
358	3964706	The rate of uptake and efflux of phosphatidylcholine from human erythrocytes depends on the fatty acyl composition of the exchanging species.	The rate of uptake of radioactive phosphatidylcholine molecules of different fatty acid composition in intact erythrocytes as facilitated by a phosphatidylcholine-specific transfer protein has been studied. When trace amounts of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine molecules are present in donor vesicles consisting of egg phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, the transfer of the radiolabeled species depends strongly on their fatty acyl composition: dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine is transferred at the lowest rate, 1-saturated-2-unsaturated species are transferred faster and the highest rate is observed for dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine. Transfer of the various phosphatidylcholine molecules was measured furthermore using donor systems in which the bulk phosphatidylcholine was varied in its fatty acyl composition. Also in this type of experiment, the transfer protein preferentially stimulated transfer of unsaturated phosphatidylcholine molecules, especially from an environment containing more saturated molecules. Finally, the efflux of labeled phosphatidylcholine from intact erythrocytes to plasma in the absence of the phosphatidylcholine-specific transfer protein was studied and it became clear that in this case the nature of the effused molecules itself, rather than the composition of the bulk lipids, determined the effuse rates. An important conclusion to be drawn from these experiments is that radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine molecules, when used as markers for phospholipid exchange or transfer, should resemble in their fatty acid composition the composition of the bulk lipid in order to provide reliable data on rates and extents of the process studied.	eng	75	84	Biochimica et biophysica acta	857	1	1986	May	09	D000727;D001692;D002352/Q000097;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008954;D010713/Q000097;D049488;D049294;D013329	Androgen-Binding Protein;Biological Transport;Carrier Proteins/blood;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Models, Biological;Phosphatidylcholines/blood;Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein;Phospholipid Transfer Proteins;Structure-Activity Relationship	Kuypers FA;Andriesse X;Child P;Roelofsen B;Op den Kamp JA;van Deenen LL	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

362	3462728	Purification, biochemical characterization, and biological function of human esterase D.	Human esterase D (carboxylesterase; carboxylic-ester hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.1), a genetic marker of retinoblastoma, was purified to biochemical homogeneity from erythrocytes. The purification scheme including carboxymethylcellulose, phenyl-Sepharose, chromatofocusing, and hydroxylapatite chromatographies resulted in a 10,000-fold purification of the enzyme with 15% recovery of total activity. The Km of esterase D was estimated to be 10 X 10(-6) M using 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate as substrate. The enzymatic activity was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate and HgCl2, suggesting an important role of SH group(s) in enzyme function. Specific rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies against esterase D were prepared and recognized either denatured or native human esterase D protein. Moreover, the polyclonal antibodies immunoprecipitated a polypeptide with a molecular mass of about 33-34 kDa from various cell lines of different mammalian species, indicating that the esterase D protein is highly conserved. The highest levels of this enzyme were found in liver and kidney. Furthermore, the expression of esterase D was enhanced 3-fold in a promonocytic cell line treated with phenobarbital but not with phorbol myristate acetate, suggesting that esterase D may have a role in detoxification. The availability of the homogeneous protein and its specific antibodies allows for cloning of the esterase D gene and facilitates studies of retinoblastomas.	eng	6790	6794	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	83	18	1986	Sep		D000906/Q000276;D043182;D002265/Q000037;D002265/Q000096;D002265/Q000302;D004790;D006801;D007700;D010634/Q000494	Antibodies/immunology;Carboxylesterase;Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors;Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/biosynthesis;Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/isolation & purification;Enzyme Induction;Humans;Kinetics;Phenobarbital/pharmacology	Lee WH;Wheatley W;Benedict WF;Huang CM;Lee EY	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
363	3111145	Phosphoglycolate synthesis by human erythrocyte pyruvate kinase.	R2-type pyruvate kinase purified monogeneously from human red cells catalyzes the phosphorylation of glycolate (glycolate kinase). Maximum activation of glycolate kinase was observed at 100 microM fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) and at 2 mM glucose-1,6-bisphosphate (Glc-1,6-P2). The Km for ATP was 1.1 mM in the absence of Fru-1,6-P2 and 1.5 mM in the presence of 1 mM Fru-1,6-P2. The Km for glycolate was 20 mM in the absence of Fru-1,6-P2 and 5 mM in the presence of 1.0 mM Fru-1,6-P2. The optimum pH was over 10.5. At the physiological concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2, Glc-1,6-P2 and ATP, the glycolate kinase activity is too low to maintain the reported level of phosphoglycolate (approx. 2-5 microM). It is demonstrated that phosphorylation of glycolate by R2-type pyruvate kinase which is predominant in mature red cells plays no physiological role. The questions whether an unknown pathway for phosphoglycolate synthesis exists or whether there is actually phosphoglycolate in red cells are raised.	eng	83	86	Acta haematologica	77	2	1987			D019794;D000255/Q000378;D004163/Q000097;D004163/Q000378;D004305;D004789;D004912/Q000201;D005635/Q000494;D006016/Q000096;D006016/Q000097;D006016/Q000494;D006801;D006863;D007700;D010766;D011770/Q000097;D011770/Q000145;D011770/Q000302	2,3-Diphosphoglycerate;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Diphosphoglyceric Acids/blood;Diphosphoglyceric Acids/metabolism;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Fructosediphosphates/pharmacology;Glycolates/biosynthesis;Glycolates/blood;Glycolates/pharmacology;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Phosphorylation;Pyruvate Kinase/blood;Pyruvate Kinase/classification;Pyruvate Kinase/isolation & purification	Sasaki H;Fujii S;Yoshizaki Y;Nakashima K;Kaneko T	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
364	3583286	Multiple forms of formaldehyde dehydrogenase from human red blood cells.	Red cell hemolysates from nonrelated Finns were analyzed by electrofocusing on polyacrylamide gel, and formaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.1) was located by an activity-staining method. Three forms of the enzyme were constantly found for all the individuals studied but no variants were observed in this population (n = 217). Human liver also had three formaldehyde dehydrogenase forms with locations identical to those of the red cell formaldehyde dehydrogenase. Population genetic studies of formaldehyde dehydrogenase can easily be performed with red cell hemolysates with the techniques described here, and there is no need to use liver biopsy samples.	eng	102	106	Human heredity	37	2	1987			D000445/Q000097;D000445/Q000235;D004912/Q000201;D005387;D006801;D007526	Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/blood;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/genetics;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Finland;Humans;Isoelectric Point	Uotila L;Koivusalo M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell;Red cell	True

366	2436624	Metabolism of biogenic aldehydes in isolated human blood cells, platelets and in plasma.	The metabolism of biogenic aldehydes was measured in different human blood fractions. Isolated erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets and plasma were incubated with 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-acetaldehyde (DOPAL) or 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde (5-HIAL), the aldehydes derived from dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine, respectively. The disappearance of the aldehydes and the formation of acid and alcohol metabolites were analysed using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The aldehydes were unstable in phosphate-buffered saline, but this nonenzymatic oxidation was prevented in the presence of EDTA, pyrophosphate or blood tissue. When DOPAL or 5-HIAL were incubated with erythrocytes, only acid metabolites were formed, whereas both acid and alcohol metabolites were formed in incubations with leukocytes or platelets. The amount of the acid metabolite exceeded that of the alcohol metabolite, both with leukocytes and platelets. No metabolites were formed when the aldehydes were incubated in plasma. The oxidation of the aldehydes in incubations with erythrocytes or platelets was totally inhibited in the presence of 50 microM of the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram. However, disulfiram did not inhibit the metabolism of DOPAL and 5-HIAL in incubations with leukocytes, suggesting that different isozymes of aldehyde dehydrogenase are present in leukocytes as compared to erythrocytes and platelets.	eng	1077	1082	Biochemical pharmacology	36	7	1987	Apr	01	D015102/Q000031;D015102/Q000097;D001792/Q000378;D004355;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006897/Q000031;D006897/Q000097;D066298;D007700;D010648/Q000097	3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic Acid/analogs & derivatives;3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic Acid/blood;Blood Platelets/metabolism;Drug Stability;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid/analogs & derivatives;Hydroxyindoleacetic Acid/blood;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Phenylacetates/blood	Helander A;Tottmar O	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
367	3036217	Adenosine kinase from human erythrocytes: kinetic studies and characterization of adenosine binding sites.	"The reaction catalyzed by adenosine kinase purified from human erythrocytes proceeds via a classical ordered sequential mechanism in which adenosine is the first substrate to bind to and AMP is the last product to dissociate from the enzyme. However, the interpretation of the steady-state kinetic data is complicated by the finding that while AMP acts as a classical product inhibitor at concentrations greater than 5 mM, at lower concentrations AMP can act as an apparent activator of the enzyme under certain conditions. This apparent activation by AMP is proposed to be due to AMP allowing the enzyme mechanism to proceed via an alternative reaction pathway that avoids substrate inhibition by adenosine. Quantitative studies of the protection of the enzyme afforded by adenosine against both spontaneous and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)-mediated oxidation of thiol groups yielded ""protection"" constants (equivalent to enzyme-adenosine dissociation constant) of 12.8 microM and 12.6 microM, respectively, values that are more than an order of magnitude greater than the dissociation constant (Kia = 0.53 microM) for the ""catalytic"" enzyme-adenosine complex. These results suggest that adenosine kinase has at least two adenosine binding sites, one at the catalytic center and another quite distinct site at which binding of adenosine protects the reactive thiol group(s). This ""protection"" site appears to be separate from the nucleoside triphosphate binding site, and it also appears to be the site that is responsible for the substrate inhibition caused by adenosine."	eng	1982	1987	Biochemistry	26	7	1987	Apr	07	D000241/Q000378;D000248/Q000097;D000248/Q000302;D000249/Q000494;D000255/Q000494;D001665;D004228/Q000494;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D010770/Q000097;D011485	Adenosine/metabolism;Adenosine Kinase/blood;Adenosine Kinase/isolation & purification;Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology;Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology;Binding Sites;Dithionitrobenzoic Acid/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Phosphotransferases/blood;Protein Binding	Hawkins CF;Bagnara AS	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
368	3687932	"Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK): the variable significance of ""nucleotide specificity"" in the characterization of mutant variants."	"The half-saturation constant (K0.5s) phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) for red cell pyruvate kinase (PK) with co-factors UDP and GDP is less than one-half that with ADP with or without additions of the allosteric modifier, fructose-1, 6-dephosphate (F-1, 6-P2) to the assay. The Vmax is markedly greater with ADP than with UDP or GDP, but with (PEP) at 0.5 mM, activity with all co-factors is about equal and at lower concentrations greater with UDP and GDP. With high K0.5s (PEP) mutant enzymes, and at the usual test concentration (lmM) for PEP when nucleotide specificity is assessed, the abnormally low saturation of variant enzymes may result in higher activity with UDP and GDP than with ADP--the opposite of the ""normal situation."" The apparent aberration in nucleotide specificity may thus be illusory and secondary to the abnormal K0.5s (PEP) of the mutant. Example data are recorded. Variations in K0.5s (PEP) may also be introduced during enzyme preparation for assay, particularly when partial purification is employed."	eng	353	356	American journal of hematology	26	4	1987	Dec		D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006863;D007700;D009154;D009711/Q000378;D010728/Q000378;D011770/Q000097;D011770/Q000235;D013379	Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Mutation;Nucleotides/metabolism;Phosphoenolpyruvate/metabolism;Pyruvate Kinase/blood;Pyruvate Kinase/genetics;Substrate Specificity	Valentine WN;Paglia DE;Nakatani M;Brockway RA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True
369	3029059	Purification and characterization of a high molecular weight type 1 phosphoprotein phosphatase from the human erythrocyte.	The major Mn2+-activated phosphoprotein phosphatase of the human erythrocyte has been purified to homogeneity from the cell hemolysate. It is sensitive to both inhibitors 1 and 2 of rabbit skeletal muscle, preferentially dephosphorylates the beta subunit of the phosphorylase kinase, and dephosphorylates a broad range of substrates including phosphorylase a, p-nitro-phenyl phosphate, phosphocasein, the regulatory subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and both spectrin (Km = 10 microM) and pyruvate kinase (Km = 18 microM) purified from the human erythrocyte. The purified enzyme is stimulated by Mn2+ and to a lesser extent by higher concentrations of Mg2+. The purification procedure was selected to avoid any change in molecular weight, hence subunit composition, between the crude and purified enzyme. Maintenance of the original structure is demonstrated by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography. Gel filtration of the purified holoenzyme shows a single active component with a Stokes radius of 58 A at a molecular weight position of 180,000. Sedimentation velocity in a glycerol gradient gives a value of 6.1 for S20, w. Together these data indicate a molecular weight of about 135,000. Two bands of equal intensity appear on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis at molecular weights of 61,700 and 36,300, suggesting a subunit composition of two 36,000 and one 62,000 subunits. The 36-kDa catalytic subunit can be isolated by freezing and thawing the holoenzyme or by hydrophobic chromatography of the holoenzyme. The catalytic subunit shows unchanged substrate and inhibitor specificity but altered metal ion activation.	eng	2016	2024	The Journal of biological chemistry	262	5	1987	Feb	15	D000818;D002352;D002850;D002852;D004591;D004722;D004789;D006801;D047908;D007527/Q000097;D007527/Q000302;D007700;D046911;D008345/Q000378;D008970;D009132/Q000032;D010749/Q000097;D010749/Q000302;D010764/Q000378;D011506/Q000494;D016601;D011817	Animals;Carrier Proteins;Chromatography, Gel;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Endoribonucleases;Enzyme Activation;Humans;Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins;Isoenzymes/blood;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Kinetics;Macromolecular Substances;Manganese/metabolism;Molecular Weight;Muscles/analysis;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/blood;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/isolation & purification;Phosphorylase Kinase/metabolism;Proteins/pharmacology;RNA-Binding Proteins;Rabbits	Kiener PA;Carroll D;Roth BJ;Westhead EW	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True

372	3805019	Purification and properties of uroporphyrinogen III synthase from human erythrocytes.	Uroporphyrinogen III synthase (hydroxymethylbilane hydro-lyase (cyclizing); EC 4.2.1.75), the fourth enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, was purified to homogeneity from human erythrocytes. For enzyme purification and characterization, a sensitive coupled enzyme assay was used which generated the substrate, hydroxymethylbilane; the oxidized product, uroporphyrin III, was quantitated by high pressure liquid chromatography. Uroporphyrinogen III synthase was initially separated from delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase and hydroxymethylbilane synthase by a preparative anion exchange chromatographic step. Subsequent chromatography on hydroxyapatite, phenyl-Sepharose, and Sephadex G-100 purified the enzyme about 70,000-fold with an 8% yield. Homogeneous enzyme was obtained following a final C4-reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatographic step which removed a single major and several minor protein contaminants from the enzyme. The purified enzyme had a specific activity of over 300,000 units/mg, an isoelectric point of 5.5, and was thermolabile (t1/2 at 60 degrees C approximately 1 min). Molecular weight studies by gel filtration (Mr approximately equal to 30,000) and analytical sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr approximately equal to 29,500) were consistent with the enzyme being a monomer. Using hydroxymethylbilane as substrate, the purified enzyme formed uroporphyrinogen III in the absence of hydroxymethylbilane synthase or other cofactors. The pH optimum was 7.4 and the Km for hydroxymethylbilane was 5-20 microM. The enzyme was activated by Na+, K+, Mg+, and Ca2+ and was inhibited by Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, and Zn2+. Amino acid composition analysis was performed, and the N-terminal sequence, Met-Lys-Val-Leu-Leu-Leu, was determined by microsequencing. The availability of the purified enzyme should permit investigation of its reaction mechanism as well as facilitate biochemical and molecular studies of the genetic defect in congenital erythropoietic porphyria.	eng	1268	1273	The Journal of biological chemistry	262	3	1987	Jan	25	D000596/Q000032;D002412;D002845;D004789;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006836/Q000097;D006863;D007525;D007700;D008970;D013439/Q000494;D014576/Q000037;D014576/Q000097;D014577/Q000378	Amino Acids/analysis;Cations;Chromatography;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydro-Lyases/blood;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Isoelectric Focusing;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;Sulfhydryl Reagents/pharmacology;Uroporphyrinogen III Synthetase/antagonists & inhibitors;Uroporphyrinogen III Synthetase/blood;Uroporphyrinogens/metabolism	Tsai SF;Bishop DF;Desnick RJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True

We present the results of a new NMR-based procedure for measuring the fast transmembrane exchange of D-[1-13C]glucose in human erythrocytes. The method relies on different rates of exchange between the alpha- and beta-anomers of glucose inside and outside the cells; the rate outside the cells is greatly increased by the addition of mutarotase to the suspension. Theory is developed to describe nuclear-spin transfer in the present system and is used to analyse the data to yield estimates of transmembrane-exchange rate constants and their statistical uncertainties. For a total glucose concentration of 25.5 mmol/l at 40 degrees C the first order efflux rate constants for the alpha- and beta-anomers were 1.20 +/- 0.40 s-1 and 0.71 +/- 0.30 s-1, respectively.	eng	5	10	FEBS letters	219	1	1987	Jul	13	D001692;D001786/Q000378;D002247;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D009682;D008433;D008954;D013237	Biological Transport;Blood Glucose/metabolism;Carbon Isotopes;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Mathematics;Models, Biological;Stereoisomerism	Kuchel PW;Chapman BE;Potts JR	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
375	3474231	Influx of 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine into HL-60 human leukemia cells and erythrocytes.	The influx of 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MeSAdo) into human HL-60 leukemia cells and erythrocytes was characterized in order to determine whether it is facilitated by the nonspecific nucleoside carrier system or by a separate transporter, as suggested by other reports. Initial velocities were measured at room temperature by means of inhibitor-stop and oil-stop assays. MeSAdo influx was strongly inhibited by Ado, dAdo, and nucleoside transport inhibitors including nitrobenzylthioinosine and dipyridamole. Ade was inhibitory only at concentrations in excess of 1 mM. Loss of nucleoside transport capacity during differentiation of HL-60 cells was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in MeSAdo influx rates. These results indicate that MeSAdo influx was mediated by the nonspecific nucleoside transport system. The kinetic data were consistent with a single saturable carrier and yielded Km values of 74 and 184 microM and Vmax values of 424 and 48 pmols/10(6) cells/min with HL-60 cells and erythrocytes, respectively, after correction for a substantial passive diffusion component, which accounted for over 50% of the influx of 1 mM MeSAdo. The passive diffusion of MeSAdo in the presence of a transport inhibitor was not rate-limiting for the salvage of 50 microM MeSAdo to methionine when HL-60 cells were cultured in methionine-deficient medium. The large contribution of passive diffusion to the influx of MeSAdo is consistent with its unusually high octanol/water partition ratio (5.7-fold greater than that of Ado).	eng	9542	9546	The Journal of biological chemistry	262	20	1987	Jul	15	D000241/Q000031;D000241/Q000097;D000241/Q000378;D000241/Q000494;D001692/Q000187;D002460;D003839;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D015470;D013872/Q000097;D013872/Q000378;D014665/Q000494	Adenosine/analogs & derivatives;Adenosine/blood;Adenosine/metabolism;Adenosine/pharmacology;Biological Transport/drug effects;Cell Line;Deoxyadenosines;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute;Thionucleosides/blood;Thionucleosides/metabolism;Vasodilator Agents/pharmacology	Stoeckler JD;Li SY	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
376	3571425	Erythrocyte-associated cortisol: measurement, kinetics of dissociation, and potential physiological significance.	It is well known that a portion of the cortisol in blood is associated with erythrocytes. This study was conducted to determine the quantity of cortisol associated with erythrocytes under physiological conditions and to assess the potential availability of that cortisol for tissue uptake. The erythrocyte-associated cortisol was determined from the volume of plasma measured using [125I]human serum albumin, the concentration of cortisol in plasma, and the total concentration of cortisol in blood. The plasma unbound cortisol fraction was determined by ultrafiltration and was used to calculate a partitioning coefficient that describes the distribution of cortisol between erythrocyte-associated and plasma unbound components. The cortisol partitioning coefficient (erythrocyte-associated cortisol concentration divided by plasma unbound cortisol concentration) did not vary significantly over a wide range of cortisol levels, nor was it affected by the presence or absence of corticosteroid-binding globulin. The cortisol partitioning coefficient in six normal men averaged 2.62 +/- 0.16 (mean +/- SD). Computer analysis of the distribution of cortisol among blood components indicated that at all cortisol levels, the proportion of blood cortisol associated with erythrocytes would exceed that which is plasma unbound or albumin-bound. The rate of dissociation of cortisol from erythrocytes was measured to determine if the kinetics of dissociation would be consistent with the tissue availability of erythrocyte-associated cortisol. Indeed, the half-time of dissociation was extremely rapid (less than 2.3 s). These results indicate that erythrocyte-associated cortisol is a substantial component of blood cortisol and that erythrocytes may serve as a major conduit for the transport of cortisol to the tissues.	eng	1224	1232	The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism	64	6	1987	Jun		D000328;D002352/Q000097;D002352/Q000502;D003201;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000502;D006801;D007700;D008297;D008722;D009994;D012016	Adult;Carrier Proteins/blood;Carrier Proteins/physiology;Computers;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/physiology;Humans;Kinetics;Male;Methods;Osmolar Concentration;Reference Values	Hiramatsu R;Nisula BC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
377	3584133	Metabolism of 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate in phosphoenolpyruvate-enriched human erythrocytes.	The concentration of 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate in erythrocytes was increased by more than 100-fold when red cells were incubated with extracellular phosphoenolpyruvate at 37 degrees C. Since these elevated levels were maintained for 60 min, the metabolism of 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate and related compounds could be investigated in phosphoenolpyruvate-treated erythrocytes. 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate synthesis was not affected by intracellular pH when the 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate level was constant but did vary with 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate concentration. On the other hand, the relationship between the rate of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthesis and 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate concentration was not straightforward. At relatively low concentrations of 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate, the observed rate of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthesis agreed with a rate calculated from a formula incorporating kinetic parameters of purified 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthase (Rose, Z.B. (1973) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 158, 903-910). However, at high concentrations of 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate, the observed rate of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthesis was lower than the calculated value. The concentration of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate did not increase even when 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate was elevated to 200 microM. Elevated levels of intracellular 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate did not inhibit glycolytic activity in these erythrocytes. These results suggest that incubation of erythrocytes with phosphoenolpyruvate is a useful technique to investigate the effect of metabolic perturbations at the intermediate stages of glycolysis.	eng	7635	7638	The Journal of biological chemistry	262	16	1987	Jun	05	D004163/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D005994/Q000097;D006019;D006801;D007700;D010728/Q000097	Diphosphoglyceric Acids/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycerophosphates/blood;Glycolysis;Humans;Kinetics;Phosphoenolpyruvate/blood	Inoue H;Moriyasu M;Hamasaki N	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
378	3597354	An NAD:cysteine ADP-ribosyltransferase is present in human erythrocytes.	A novel enzymatic activity, i.e., the catalysis of the formation of ADP-ribosylcysteine, was found in the cytosol of human erythrocytes. The NAD:cysteine ADP-ribosyltransferase was partially purified by sequential chromatographic steps on phenyl-Sepharose, phosphocellulose, and Sepharose CL-6B. The enzyme has an apparent molecular weight of 27,000 +/- 3,000, as determined by gel permeation. The formation of ADP-ribosylcysteine was associated with the stoichiometric release of nicotinamide from NAD. The enzyme was found to be highly specific toward cysteine and cysteine methyl ester as ADP-ribose acceptors. S-Benzoyl-L-cysteine, cystine, histidine, glutamic acid, arginine, arginine methyl ester, and agmatine were ineffective as acceptors for this enzyme.	eng	821	824	Journal of biochemistry	101	3	1987	Mar		D000244/Q000378;D002850;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008970	Adenosine Diphosphate/metabolism;Chromatography, Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Molecular Weight	Tanuma S;Kawashima K;Endo H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
379	3036088	Dephosphorylation of myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and myo-inositol 1,3,4-triphosphate.	We have augmented our previous studies [Storey, Shears, Kirk & Michell (1984) Nature (London) 312, 374-376] on the subcellular location and properties of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) phosphatases in rat liver and human erythrocytes. We also investigate Ins(1,3,4)P3 (inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate) metabolism by rat liver. Membrane-bound and cytosolic Ins(1,4,5)P3 phosphatases both attack the 5-phosphate. The membrane-bound enzyme is located on the inner face of the plasma membrane, and there is little or no activity associated with Golgi apparatus. Cytosolic Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase (Mr 77,000) was separated by gel filtration from Ins(1,4)P2 (inositol 1,4-bisphosphate) and inositol 1-phosphate phosphatases (Mr 54,000). Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase activity in hepatocytes was unaffected by treatment of the cells with insulin, vasopressin, glucagon or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase activity in cell homogenates was unaffected by changes in [Ca2+] from 0.1 to 2 microM. After centrifugation of a liver homogenate at 100,000 g, Ins(1,3,4)P3 phosphatase activity was largely confined to the supernatant. The sum of the activities in the supernatant and the pellet exceeded that in the original homogenate. When these fractions were recombined, Ins(1,3,4)P3 phosphatase activity was restored to that observed in unfractionated homogenate. Ins(1,3,4)P3 was produced from Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate) and was metabolized to a novel InsP2 that was the 3,4-isomer. Ins(1,3,4)P3 phosphatase activity was not changed by 50 mM-Li+ or 0.07 mM-Ins(1,4)P2 alone, but when added together these agents inhibited Ins(1,3,4)P3 metabolism. In Li+-treated and vasopressin-stimulated hepatocytes, Ins(1,4)P2 may reach concentrations sufficient to inhibit Ins(1,3,4)P3 metabolism, with little effect on Ins(1,4,5)P3 hydrolysis.	eng	393	402	The Biochemical journal	242	2	1987	Mar	01	D000818;D002462/Q000201;D002850;D002851;D003600/Q000201;D004910/Q000201;D006056/Q000201;D006801;D015544;D007295/Q000378;D008094/Q000494;D008099/Q000187;D008099/Q000201;D008099/Q000378;D008297;D010744/Q000378;D010766;D051381;D013403/Q000378	Animals;Cell Membrane/enzymology;Chromatography, Gel;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Golgi Apparatus/enzymology;Humans;Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate;Inositol Phosphates/metabolism;Lithium/pharmacology;Liver/drug effects;Liver/enzymology;Liver/metabolism;Male;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism;Phosphorylation;Rats;Sugar Phosphates/metabolism	Shears SB;Storey DJ;Morris AJ;Cubitt AB;Parry JB;Michell RH;Kirk CJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
380	2821996	Influence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on the turnover of the phosphomonoester group of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in human erythrocyte membranes.	In isolated erythrocyte membranes, increasing the free Mg2+ concentration from 0.5 to 10 mM progressively activates the membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) kinase and leads to the establishment of a new equilibrium with higher phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and lower PtdIns concentrations. The steady-state turnover of the phosphomonoester group of PtdIns4P also increases at high Mg2+ concentrations, indicating a simultaneous activation of PtdIns4P phosphomonoesterase by Mg2+. Half-maximum inhibition of PtdIns kinase occurs at 10 microM free Ca2+ in the presence of physiological free Mg2+ concentrations. Increasing free Mg2+ concentrations overcome Ca2+ inhibition of PtdIns kinase. In the presence of Ca2+, calmodulin activates Ca2+-transporting ATPase 5-fold, but does not alter pool size and radiolabelling of PtdIns4P. In intact erythrocytes, adding EGTA or EGTA plus Mg2+ and the ionophore A23187 to the external medium does not exert significant effects on concentration and radiolabelling of polyphosphoinositides when compared with controls in the presence of 1.4 mM free Ca2+.	eng	183	190	The Biochemical journal	244	1	1987	May	15	D019870;D002118/Q000494;D002147/Q000494;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D008274/Q000494;D019269;D018129;D010716/Q000097;D010770/Q000097	1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase;Calcium/pharmacology;Calmodulin/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Magnesium/pharmacology;Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate;Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates;Phosphatidylinositols/blood;Phosphotransferases/blood	Hegewald H;Müller E;Klinger R;Wetzker R;Frunder H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
381	3675626	Characterization of human erythrocyte aldehyde dehydrogenase.	Human erythrocyte aldehyde dehydrogenase was purified to homogeneity. The enzyme exhibited a single band of activity on starch gel electrophoresis and on isoelectric focusing. It was a tetramer with an estimated molecular weight of 230,000 daltons and an isoelectric point of 5.0. Its pH optimum of 8.5, Michaelis-Menten constant for acetaldehyde of 46 microM, and high sensitivity to noncompetitive inhibition by disulfiram resembled human liver cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase. Low concentrations of magnesium (5-10 microM) resulted in enhancement of erythrocyte aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, whereas higher physiological concentrations of magnesium resulted in uncompetitive inhibition of enzyme activity. Magnesium inhibited the enzyme activity by increasing the binding of NADH to the enzyme as had been found to be the case for the inhibitory effect of magnesium on the human liver cytosolic enzyme. Erythrocyte aldehyde dehydrogenase may metabolize small amounts of acetaldehyde escaping the liver during ethanol metabolism and protect extrahepatic tissues from acetaldehyde toxicity.	eng	3715	3722	Biochemical pharmacology	36	21	1987	Nov	01	D000079/Q000378;D000444/Q000097;D000444/Q000302;D000444/Q000502;D004221/Q000494;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008274/Q000494;D009243/Q000494	Acetaldehyde/metabolism;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/blood;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/isolation & purification;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/physiology;Disulfiram/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Magnesium/pharmacology;NAD/pharmacology	Rawles JW;Rhodes DL;Potter JJ;Mezey E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
382	3318829	Localization of GTP cyclohydrolase I in human peripheral blood smears using a specific monoclonal antibody and an immune-alkaline phosphatase labeling technique.	GTP cyclohydrolase I, the enzyme catalyzing the first step in the cofactor biosynthesis for the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, has been localized in situ. By the use of a monoclonal antibody specific to human GTP cyclohydrolase I, the enzyme has been visualized immuno-enzymatically by alkaline phosphatase monoclonal anti-alkaline phosphatase labeling. In routine blood smears lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and granulocytes show strong intraplasmatic staining. Premature erythrocytes show clear staining of the reticulated cytoplasmatic structure, while mature erythrocytes are completely negative. Neither is there any staining for GTP cyclohydrolase I in the blast cells of a case of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These results closely confirm the prior finding that mature erythrocytes as well as most malignant mononuclear cells lack GTP cyclohydrolase I activity, and they indicate that in these cells the enzyme protein may be absent.	eng	1232	1236	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	148	3	1987	Nov	13	D000469;D000619/Q000097;D000911;D001708/Q000031;D001708/Q000096;D001773/Q000201;D006136/Q000097;D006801;D007124	Alkaline Phosphatase;Aminohydrolases/blood;Antibodies, Monoclonal;Biopterins/analogs & derivatives;Biopterins/biosynthesis;Blood Cells/enzymology;GTP Cyclohydrolase/blood;Humans;Immunoenzyme Techniques	Schoedon G;Curtis HC;Niederwieser A	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
383	3308682	Hyperphenylalaninemia due to deficiency of 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase. Unusual gene dosage effect in heterozygotes.	We have identified deficient biopterin synthesis in four probands and one sib with persistent postnatal hyperphenylalaninemia. The metabolic findings were associated with a benign clinical presentation and normal biopterin level in cerebrospinal fluid in the newborn period, indicating the peripheral (hepatic) form of this autosomal recessive phenotype. Impaired development was apparent at 3 months in one proband not treated early. Treatment with oral tetrahydropterin restored adequate phenylalanine hydroxylase activity; it also maintained or improved CNS function. The deficient enzyme in these subjects is 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (PTS). Erythrocyte activity of PTS in homozygotes (or compound heterozygotes) is less than 10% of normal. Heterozygotes have 20%-50% of normal PTS activity (enzyme phenotype), a finding compatible with a range of gene dosage effects, some abnormal. The metabolic phenotype in heterozygotes (urine biopterin excretion) did not correlate with erythrocyte PTS activity. The complex relationship between erythrocyte PTS activity, and biopterin synthesis in these families indicates genetic heterogeneity at the PTS locus.	eng	168	171	Human genetics	77	2	1987	Oct		D000429/Q000097;D000429/Q000172;D000429/Q000235;D000592/Q000201;D000592/Q000235;D002675;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D014644;D006579;D006801;D007223;D007231;D008297;D010641;D010649/Q000097;D019761;D011622/Q000652	Alcohol Oxidoreductases/blood;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/deficiency;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/genetics;Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/enzymology;Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/genetics;Child, Preschool;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Genetic Variation;Heterozygote;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Male;Phenotype;Phenylalanine/blood;Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases;Pterins/urine	Scriver CR;Clow CL;Kaplan P;Niederwieser A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

385	2854949	Cytosolic purine 5'-nucleotidases of rat liver and human red blood cells: regulatory properties and role in AMP dephosphorylation.	Of the various species of cellular 5'-nucleotidases, membranous, lysosomal and cytosolic, only the latter are likely to play a role in the physiologic dephosphorylation of the 5'-nucleoside monophosphates present in the cytoplasm. The necessity to preserve cellular ATP renders a strict control of the dephosphorylation as well as of the deamination of AMP mandatory, because both nucleotides are maintained in equilibrium by adenylate kinase. Our studies of cytosolic purine 5'-nucleotidases purified from rat liver and from human erythrocytes, reviewed in this presentation, have shown that both display complex kinetic properties. Both enzymes have markedly higher affinities for IMP and for GMP than for AMP. In addition, they are stimulated by nucleoside triphosphates, among them ATP and GTP, and inhibited by Pi. The erythrocytic purine 5'-nucleotidase is also stimulated by glycerate 2,3-bisphosphate. It could thus be expected that under conditions of ATP and GTP breakdown, particularly when accompanied by an increase in Pi, the dephosphorylation of AMP would be curtailed. To verify this hypothesis, experiments were performed with isolated rat hepatocytes and with human red blood cells. The rate of dephosphorylation of AMP was measured by following time-wise the production of adenosine in the presence of coformycin (or deoxycoformycin) and 5-iodotubercidin. The coformycins inhibit the deamination of adenosine into inosine by adenosine deaminase, and 5-iodotubercidin inhibits the recycling of adenosine into AMP by adenosine kinase. Upon induction of ATP catabolism by the addition of fructose to isolated rat hepatocytes, the dephosphorylation of AMP was nearly completely suppressed. In accordance with these results, the activity of the rat liver cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase, assayed in the presence of concentrations of substrate and effectors mimicking those measured in intact cells following the addition of fructose, was decreased as compared to control conditions. In hepatocytes in which ATP catabolism was induced by suppression of oxygen, the rate of dephosphorylation of AMP increased about 3-fold. However, in contradiction with these data, the activity of the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase, measured under conditions mimicking anoxia, decreased markedly. In human erythrocytes, dephosphorylation of AMP did not occur under physiologic conditions, but proceeded when ATP catabolism was induced by glucose lack or by alkalinization. The rate of dephosphorylation of AMP was 3-fold higher during glucose deprivation than under alkaline conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	eng	297	311	Advances in enzyme regulation	27		1988			D000249/Q000378;D000818;D002478;D003600/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008099/Q000201;D009708/Q000097;D009708/Q000378;D009708/Q000502;D010766;D051381	Adenosine Monophosphate/metabolism;Animals;Cells, Cultured;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Liver/enzymology;Nucleotidases/blood;Nucleotidases/metabolism;Nucleotidases/physiology;Phosphorylation;Rats	Van den Berghe G;Bontemps F;Vincent MF	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte;erythro	True

387	2839392	Phospholipid biosynthesis in mature human erythrocytes.	Mature human erythrocytes were tested for their ability to synthetize membrane phospholipids from simple precursors: [32P]-orthophosphate (32Pi), [U-14C] glycerol, [U-14C] glucose, [U-14C] serine, and [U-14C] choline. The incorporation of these labels into phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic acid (PA), lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP), and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) was measured. All the phospholipids tested incorporated 32Pi, glycerol, and glucose in a time dependent manner. According to the rate of 32Pi incorporation, three groups of phospholipids could be distinguished: 1) PA, PIP2, PIP, lyso-PC; 2) PI and PS; 3) PC and PE, which incorporated 5 x 10(3), 40, and 6 nmol 32Pi/mmol phospholipid per 1 h, respectively. Moreover, [U-14C] serine and [U14C] choline were found to incorporate into phospholipids, and PS-decarboxylase activity could be measured. The possibility that the observed incorporation was due to contamination with bacteria or other blood cells could be ruled out. Our results bring evidence for de novo phospholipid synthesis of human red blood cells.	eng	205	216	General physiology and biophysics	7	2	1988	Apr		D002262/Q000378;D002794/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D005990/Q000378;D006801;D010710/Q000378;D010712/Q000096;D010716/Q000096;D010743/Q000096;D012694/Q000378	Carboxy-Lyases/metabolism;Choline/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Glycerol/metabolism;Humans;Phosphates/metabolism;Phosphatidic Acids/biosynthesis;Phosphatidylinositols/biosynthesis;Phospholipids/biosynthesis;Serine/metabolism	Strunecká A;Folk P	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
388	2900016	Human erythrocyte transglutaminase: purification and preliminary characterisation.	Erythrocyte transglutaminase was purified by anion-exchange chromatography, size exclusion and affinity chromatography. Homogeneity was achieved by an additional step of HPLC size-exclusion chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was calculated to be 65,000 Da by size-exclusion chromatography and sucrose-gradient centrifugation, and 92,000 Da by SDS-PAGE, thus suggesting a high degree of asymmetry. The amino-acid composition of erythrocyte transglutaminase differed substantially from that of the guinea-pig liver enzyme, notably with respect to the number of histidine, cysteine and acidic amino-acid residues. The enzyme has an absolute requirement for divalent cations for activity: calcium, manganese, and the lanthanides terbium and gadolinium activate the enzyme in decreasing order of efficacy, while no activity is displayed in the presence of magnesium. In the presence but not in the absence of calcium ions, the enzyme is rapidly inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide and by diethylpyrocarbonate suggesting that the cation influences the reactivity of amino acids essential for catalysis. When erythrocyte proteins are employed as amine acceptors in the presence of calcium, the erythrocyte transglutaminase appears to preferentially modify membrane-associated proteins, although, in the absence of calcium ions and exogenous amines, it displays a pH-dependent interaction with soluble proteins.	eng	275	281	Biological chemistry Hoppe-Seyler	369	4	1988	Apr		D000596/Q000032;D002413;D002846;D002850;D002852;D004789;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008970;D011503/Q000097;D011503/Q000302	Amino Acids/analysis;Cations, Divalent;Chromatography, Affinity;Chromatography, Gel;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;Transglutaminases/blood;Transglutaminases/isolation & purification	Signorini M;Bortolotti F;Poltronieri L;Bergamini CM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
389	3128540	Eukaryotic mono(ADP-ribosyl)transferase that ADP-ribosylates GTP-binding regulatory Gi protein.	An NAD:cysteine ADP-ribosyltransferase designated ADP-ribosyltransferase C was purified approximately 35,000-fold from human erythrocytes with an 11% yield. The purified ADP-ribosyltransferase C exhibited one predominant protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with an estimated molecular weight (Mr) of 28,500. The Km values for NAD and cysteine methyl ester were determined to be 65 and 4,400 microM, respectively. By using human erythrocyte inside-out membrane vesicles, the transferase C was found to ADP-ribosylate the alpha subunit (Mr = 41,000) of Gi, which is a substrate for pertussis toxin. The ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha catalyzed by ADP-ribosyltransferase C was inhibited by pre-ADP-ribosylation with pertussis toxin. The linkage of ADP-ribose-Gi alpha in the membranes formed by ADP-ribosyltransferase C was as stable to hydroxylamine as that formed by pertussis toxin. These data represent the first demonstration that eukaryotic cells contain an ADP-ribosyltransferase which can catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of a cysteine residue in Gi alpha.	eng	5485	5489	The Journal of biological chemistry	263	11	1988	Apr	15	D036002/Q000302;D036002/Q000378;D000246/Q000378;D001905;D003545/Q000031;D003545/Q000494;D004912/Q000201;D019204/Q000378;D006801;D019811;D006898/Q000494;D007700;D008970;D009243/Q000494	ADP Ribose Transferases/isolation & purification;ADP Ribose Transferases/metabolism;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Botulinum Toxins;Cysteine/analogs & derivatives;Cysteine/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism;Humans;Hydroxylamine;Hydroxylamines/pharmacology;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;NAD/pharmacology	Tanuma S;Kawashima K;Endo H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
390	2841133	Demonstration of a novel ecto-enzyme on human erythrocytes, capable of degrading ADP and of inhibiting ADP-induced platelet aggregation.	The role of ADP as an important inducer of platelet aggregation is generally accepted. Therefore it has been postulated by many authors that the enzymatic removal of extracellular ADP from the circulation is essential to avoid platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Here we show that erythrocytes essentially contribute to the clearance of ADP. The removal of ADP from suspensions of washed human erythrocytes was due to at least two different activities. One activity, which had already been observed by earlier workers, was identified as adenylate kinase, on the basis of the reaction products and the inhibition by adenosine(5')pentaphospho(5')adenosine (Ap5A). This enzyme was not associated with the cells and was always detectable in cell-free supernatants, indicating that the enzyme had leaked from the cells into the extracellular medium. In contrast, the second activity, which is described here for the first time, was tightly bound to the cells. The activity was not inhibited by Ap5A. The main product of the reaction was AMP, and enzyme activity depended on the presence of divalent cations. The Michaelis constant was about 28 mumol/l. This activity seemed to be an ecto-ADPase. Studies with various inhibitors revealed that degradation of ADP was not due to a non-specific phosphatase. Besides the well known ADPase on the endothelium, the ecto-activity on erythrocytes may play an important part in destroying pro-aggregatory ADP.	eng	285	289	European journal of biochemistry	175	2	1988	Aug	01	D000244/Q000037;D000244/Q000097;D000244/Q000502;D001081/Q000097;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D010710/Q000097;D010744/Q000097;D010974	Adenosine Diphosphate/antagonists & inhibitors;Adenosine Diphosphate/blood;Adenosine Diphosphate/physiology;Apyrase/blood;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Phosphates/blood;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/blood;Platelet Aggregation	Lüthje J;Schomburg A;Ogilvie A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
391	3415679	Oxidative stresses induced the cystine transport activity in human erythrocytes.	Cystine was transported into human erythrocytes in the presence of tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BH) or 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). The transport rate of cystine was dependent on the extracellular concentration of t-BH or CDNB, and on the incubation time. According to Dowex-1 column chromatography, the transported cystine was incorporated into fractions of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and glutathione-S (GSH-S) conjugate. The transport of cystine was competitively inhibited by DL-homocystine and alanine. The inhibition rates by DL-homocystine and alanine were 75% and 68%, with similar Ki values of 0.7 mM and 0.6 mM, respectively. It is suggested that cystine transport is induced for glutathione synthesis when human erythrocytes are exposed to oxidative stresses. This transport system of cystine may serve as an emergency function in human erythrocytes.	eng	160	166	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	155	1	1988	Aug	30	D001692/Q000187;D003553/Q000097;D004137;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005033;D006801;D007700;D010084;D010545;D012964;D020122	Biological Transport/drug effects;Cystine/blood;Dinitrochlorobenzene;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Ethylmaleimide;Humans;Kinetics;Oxidation-Reduction;Peroxides;Sodium;tert-Butylhydroperoxide	Ohtsuka Y;Kondo T;Kawakami Y	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
392	3143662	Lysinuric protein intolerance mutation is not expressed in the plasma membrane of erythrocytes.	We measured mediated fluxes of L-lysine and L-ornithine across the plasma membrane of erythrocytes from control subjects and patients homozygous for the lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) mutation. We found no differences in net uptake or efflux of cationic amino acids in control and LPI cells, contrary to our findings in cultured skin fibroblasts. We conclude that expression of the LPI (y+) transport system for cationic amino acids varies between tissues and that measurements of fluxes in erythrocytes cannot be used for diagnosis of LPI.	eng	395	396	Human genetics	80	4	1988	Dec		D000328;D000592/Q000235;D000592/Q000378;D001692;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D008239/Q000097;D008239/Q000378;D009154;D010641	Adult;Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/genetics;Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/metabolism;Biological Transport;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Lysine/blood;Lysine/metabolism;Mutation;Phenotype	Smith DW;Scriver CR;Simell O	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
393	3126064	Human erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Identification of a reactive lysyl residue labelled with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate.	Human erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase contains a reactive lysyl residue, which can be labelled with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. The binding of one mole of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate per mole of enzyme subunit produces substantial inactivation. The substrate glucose-6-phosphate prevents the loss of activity, suggesting that the reaction site is close to the substrate-binding site. A tryptic peptide containing the pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-binding lysyl residue has been isolated and characterised. The reactive lysyl residue has been identified in the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase amino acid sequence. Comparison with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from other sources shows a high homology with a peptide containing a reactive lysyl residue, isolated from the enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides also contains a region highly homologous with the sequence around the reactive lysyl residue in the human enzyme. The results of this communication provide the first direct evidence for the association of an essential catalytic function with a specific region of the molecule of human erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.	eng	485	489	European journal of biochemistry	171	3	1988	Feb	01	D000345;D000595;D000596/Q000097;D001665;D004912/Q000201;D005954/Q000097;D006801;D006868;D008239/Q000097;D010455/Q000097;D011732;D014357	Affinity Labels;Amino Acid Sequence;Amino Acids/blood;Binding Sites;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/blood;Humans;Hydrolysis;Lysine/blood;Peptides/blood;Pyridoxal Phosphate;Trypsin	Camardella L;Caruso C;Rutigliano B;Romano M;Di Prisco G;Descalzi-Cancedda F	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
394	3370820	Altered erythrocyte nucleotide patterns are characteristic of inherited disorders of purine or pyrimidine metabolism.	This paper compares erythrocyte nucleotide levels in patients with eight different inherited purine or pyrimidine enzyme defects identified amongst a variety of patients referred predominantly for investigation of severe neurological abnormalities, or immunodeficiency syndromes. Characteristic nucleotide patterns were identified only in the six disorders (four involving purine and two pyrimidine metabolism) where there was clinical evidence of cellular toxicity. They were frequently related to the accumulation of abnormal metabolites in body fluids. These erythrocyte studies have demonstrated the following. 1. ATP depletion is not an invariable feature of adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, but the accumulation of the deoxyribonucleotides dATP, or dGTP, is diagnostic of ADA, or purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency, respectively. The early accumulation of dATP in foetal blood is a valuable aid to prenatal diagnosis of ADA deficiency. 2. GTP depletion appears to reflect the degree of CNS involvement in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and PNP deficiency, as well as PP-ribose-P synthetase superactivity. Other diagnostic changes involving increased pyrimidine sugars and increased or decreased NAD levels, or ZTP in Lesch Nyhan erythrocytes, show no consistent correlation with the clinical manifestations. 3. These altered nucleotide levels afford a novel means for carrier detection of the X-linked defect associated with aberrant PP-ribose-P synthetase activity, where no other test is yet available. Measurement of erythrocyte nucleotide levels thus provides a simple and rapid aid to diagnosis and may sometimes be essential for determining prognosis, carrier detection, or monitoring therapy. These characteristic 'fingerprints' may give some insight into the mechanism by which the abnormal gene product produces disease. Such grossly altered nucleotide levels could also result in loss of erythrocyte flexibility, increased destruction and hence the anaemia, or other clinical manifestations, observed in some disorders.	eng	197	210	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	171	2-3	1988	Feb	15	D000244/Q000097;D000255/Q000097;D002851;D004912/Q000032;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007223;D009711/Q000097;D011379;D011686/Q000097;D011686/Q000175	Adenosine Diphosphate/blood;Adenosine Triphosphate/blood;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/analysis;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Infant;Nucleotides/blood;Prognosis;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/blood;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/diagnosis	Simmonds HA;Fairbanks LD;Morris GS;Webster DR;Harley EH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
395	3052244	Biochemical and genetic identity of alpha-keto acid reductase and cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes.	We have recently shown that cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase (MDH-s) from several non-human species catalyses the reduction of aromatic alpha-keto acids in the presence of NADH (Friedrich et al. 1987), an activity previously attributed to the enzyme aromatic alpha-keto acid reductase (KAR E.C.1.1.1.96). Here we present evidence that this also occurs in humans, and that the previously characterized human KAR is not the product of a genetically distinct locus. Human MDH-s and KAR activities co-migrate after starch gel electrophoresis, and electrophoretic variants of human MDH-s exhibited identical variation for KAR. Both enzymes show almost no electrophoretic variation among human populations of diverse origin. The reduction of aromatic alpha-keto acids is substantially inhibited by malate, the end-product of the MDH reaction. Antibodies raised against purified chicken MDH-s equally inhibited both MDH-s and KAR in chickens and humans. The bulk of the KAR activity in human blood appears to be due to MDH-s, with a minor fraction catalysed by LDH, as is the case in most other species studied. The previous assignment of a gene for KAR to human chromosome 12 in human/Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids is questioned because interspecific hybrid bands of both MDH-s and LDH appear with slightly different mobility approximately midway between the human and hamster controls in somatic cell hybrid studies, and the meaning of this artifact is discussed. The discovery that MDH reacts with intermediate metabolites of phenylalanine and tyrosine has implications in relation to the mechanism by which mental retardation may be produced in phenylketonuria (PKU), and the effect of MDH inhibition on oxidative phosphorylation in the various tyrosinaemias is discussed.	eng	25	37	Annals of human genetics	52	1	1988	Jan		D000429/Q000097;D000429/Q000235;D003593/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006358;D006801;D006822;D007527;D008291/Q000097;D008291/Q000235	Alcohol Oxidoreductases/blood;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/genetics;Cytoplasm/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Hot Temperature;Humans;Hybrid Cells;Isoenzymes;Malate Dehydrogenase/blood;Malate Dehydrogenase/genetics	Friedrich CA;Ferrell RE;Siciliano MJ;Kitto GB	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
396	3276524	Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency: assay for 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase activity in erythrocytes, and detection of patients and heterozygous carriers.	"6-Pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTS), a key enzyme in the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin in man, is defective in the most frequent variant of tetrahydrobiopterin-deficient hyperphenylalaninaemia (atypical phenylketonuria). An assay for PTS activity in erythrocytes was developed. It is based on the PTS-catalysed formation of tetrahydrobiopterin from dihydroneopterin triphosphate in the presence of magnesium, sepiapterin reductase, NADPH, dihydropteridine reductase, and NADH, and fluorimetric measurement of the product as biopterin by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after oxidation with iodine. The PTS activity was higher in younger erythrocytes, including reticulocytes, than in older ones. Fetal erythrocytes showed approx. four times higher activities than those of adults. Using a more purified human liver sepiapterin reductase fraction which gave a lower yield than a crude preparation, adult controls (n = 8) showed a mean erythrocyte PTS activity of 17.6 (range 11.0-29.5) microU/g Hb. Nine of 11 patients with typical PTS deficiency showed activities between 0% and 8% of the mean of controls, and two of 11 showed 14% and 20%, respectively. The obligate heterozygotes (n = 16) had activities of 19% (range 8%-31%) of the mean of controls, i.e., significantly less than the expected 50%. Four patients with the ""peripheral"" type of the disease showed 7%-10% of the mean of controls. Thus, the assay did not distinguish between patients and heterozygotes in every family. The assay is well suited to the identification of heterozygotes of PTS deficiency in family studies."	eng	15	19	European journal of pediatrics	147	1	1988	Jan		D000328;D000375;D000429/Q000097;D001708/Q000031;D001708/Q000096;D001708/Q000172;D002648;D002675;D002851;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007223;D008875;D009097/Q000097	Adult;Aging;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/blood;Biopterins/analogs & derivatives;Biopterins/biosynthesis;Biopterins/deficiency;Child;Child, Preschool;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Infant;Middle Aged;Multienzyme Complexes/blood	Shintaku H;Niederwieser A;Leimbacher W;Curtius HC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
397	3422427	Alternative transcription and splicing of the human porphobilinogen deaminase gene result either in tissue-specific or in housekeeping expression.	Porphobilinogen deaminase [PBGD; porphobilinogen ammonia-lyase (polymerizing), EC 4.3.1.8] is a cytosolic enzyme involved in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Two isoforms of PBGD, encoded by two mRNAs differing solely in their 5' end, are known: one is found in all cells and the other is present only in erythroid cells. We have previously shown that the human PBGD is encoded by a single gene and have now cloned and characterized this gene, which is split into 15 exons spread over 10 kilobases of DNA. We demonstrate that the two mRNAs arise from two overlapping transcription units. The first one (upstream) is active in all tissues and its promoter has some of the structural features of a housekeeping promoter; the second, located 3 kilobases downstream, is active only in erythroid cells and its promoter displays structural homologies with the beta-globin gene promoters.	eng	6	10	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	85	1	1988	Jan		D000642/Q000235;D000818;D001483;D003001;D003360;D004274/Q000378;D005091;D005786;D005796;D006801;D011163/Q000235;D007438;D008969;D012326;D012689;D014158	Ammonia-Lyases/genetics;Animals;Base Sequence;Cloning, Molecular;Cosmids;DNA, Recombinant/metabolism;Exons;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Humans;Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase/genetics;Introns;Molecular Sequence Data;RNA Splicing;Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid;Transcription, Genetic	Chretien S;Dubart A;Beaupain D;Raich N;Grandchamp B;Rosa J;Goossens M;Romeo PH	Journal, Articles							erythro	True
398	3379069	"Purine nucleobase transport in human erythrocytes. Reinvestigation with a novel ""inhibitor-stop"" assay."	"A novel ""inhibitor-stop"" method for the determination of initial rates of purine nucleobase transport in human erythrocytes has been developed, based on the addition of seven assay volumes of cold 19 mM papaverine to terminate influx. In view of our finding that the initial velocities of adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine influx into human erythrocytes were linear for only 4-6 s at 37 degrees C, the present method has been used to reexamine the kinetics of purine nucleobase transport in these cells. Initial influx rates of all three purine nucleobases were shown to be the result of concurrent facilitated and nonfacilitated diffusion. The nonfacilitated influx rates could be estimated either from the linear concentration dependence of nucleobase influx at high concentrations of permeant or from residual influx rates which were not inhibited by the presence of co-permeants. Appropriate corrections for nonfacilitated diffusion were made to the influx rates observed at low nucleobase concentrations. Kinetic analyses indicated that adenine (Km = 13 +/- 1 microM, n = 7), guanine (Km = 37 +/- 2 microM, n = 5), and hypoxanthine (Km = 180 +/- 12 microM, n = 6) were mutually competitive substrates for transport. The Ki values obtained with each nucleobase as an inhibitor of the influx of the other nucleobases were similar to their respective Km values for influx. Furthermore, the transport of the purine nucleobases was not inhibited by nucleosides (uridine, inosine) or by inhibitors of nucleoside transport (6-[(4-nitrobenzyl)thio]-9-beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine, dilazep, dipyridamole). It is concluded that all three purine nucleobases share a common facilitated transport system in human erythrocytes which is functionally distinct from the nucleoside transporter."	eng	9276	9284	The Journal of biological chemistry	263	19	1988	Jul	05	D000225/Q000378;D001692/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D006147/Q000378;D006801;D019271;D007042/Q000378;D066298;D007700;D010208/Q000494	Adenine/metabolism;Biological Transport/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Guanine/metabolism;Humans;Hypoxanthine;Hypoxanthines/metabolism;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Papaverine/pharmacology	Domin BA;Mahony WB;Zimmerman TP	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
399	2841083	Erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase and deoxynucleotidase isozymes: metallosensitivity and kinetics.	Erythrocytes from a subject with classical pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (P5N) deficiency (PND) possessed typically low nucleotidase activity with uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) and cytidine 5'-monophosphate (CMP) as the substrates with subnormal dephosphorylation of 2'-deoxy thymidine 5'-monophosphate (dTMP) and 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (dUMP) and intermediate activity with 2'-deoxycytidine 5'-monophosphate (dCMP). Contrary to previously reported data, there was enzyme activity with all five substrates. The metallosensitivities of the P5N isozymes using UMP, dUMP, dCMP and dTMP as the substrates were defined. Nucleotidase (P5N) is slightly more sensitive than 2'-deoxy-pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (dP5N) to inhibition by lead, copper and mercury. Chromium stimulated more enzyme activity with dCMP than other substrates. Apparent Michaelis constants (Km) were calculated for UMP, CMP, dUMP, dCMP, and dTMP for PND and control subjects. Optimal activity was at pH 7.0-7.8 when using UMP and CMP as the substrates but at pH 5.5-6.5 with dUMP, dCMP and dTMP as the substrates. The Km, pH optima and metallosensitivities were, however, consistent with electrophoretic evidence for two and probably three isozymes: P5N with maximal affinity for UMP and CMP; dP5N with maximal affinity for dUMP and dTMP; and a closely related dCMPase. The relative activity with representative substrates can be used to distinguish homozygotes and heterozygotes for P5N deficiency and subjects with heavy metal exposure.	eng	195	213	Drug and chemical toxicology	11	2	1988	Jun		D015720;D000328;D002851;D002857/Q000633;D003300/Q000633;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006863;D007527/Q000037;D007527/Q000097;D007527/Q000172;D007700;D007854/Q000633;D008297;D008670/Q000633;D009708/Q000037;D009708/Q000097;D009708/Q000172;D013379	5'-Nucleotidase;Adult;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Chromium/toxicity;Copper/toxicity;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors;Isoenzymes/blood;Isoenzymes/deficiency;Kinetics;Lead/toxicity;Male;Metals/toxicity;Nucleotidases/antagonists & inhibitors;Nucleotidases/blood;Nucleotidases/deficiency;Substrate Specificity	Cook L;Kubitschek C;Stohs S;Angle C	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte	True
400	3345617	Pharmacogenetics of N-methylation: heritability of human erythrocyte histamine N-methyltransferase activity.	Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) catalyzes the N tau-methylation of histamine. HNMT is present in many human tissues, including the red blood cell (RBC). Our study evaluated the possible role of inheritance in the regulation of individual variations in human RBC HNMT activity. HNMT activity was measured in RBC lysates from 241 members of 51 nuclear families. After correction for the gender-specific effects of age, the frequency distribution of RBC HNMT activities was unimodal, and activities varied threefold within 2 SDs of the mean. The correlation of HNMT activities in RBCs from 45 pairs of spouses was only 0.070, indicating that shared environment did not result in similar activities among genetically unrelated individuals. Correlation coefficients were also calculated for pairs of genetically related individuals. All of these correlations were significant except the mother-oldest son correlation. The majority of the correlations did not differ significantly from those predicted for a trait with a heritability of 1.0 (100%). Our results demonstrate a significant familial aggregation of human RBC HNMT activity and suggest that inheritance may play an important role in the regulation of variation in the activity of this N-methyltransferase enzyme in the human RBC.	eng	256	262	Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics	43	3	1988	Mar		D000367;D001711;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006632/Q000493;D006637/Q000235;D006637/Q000378;D006801;D008297;D008745;D008780/Q000235;D010375;D012737	Age Factors;Biotransformation;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Histamine/pharmacokinetics;Histamine N-Methyltransferase/genetics;Histamine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism;Humans;Male;Methylation;Methyltransferases/genetics;Pedigree;Sex Factors	Scott MC;Van Loon JA;Weinshilboum RM	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
401	3280030	Identification of cyclophilin as the erythrocyte ciclosporin-binding protein.	Previous studies on the distribution of circulating ciclosporin have shown that the majority of the drug is associated with erythrocytes. In order to investigate the nature of ciclosporin-erythrocyte binding, binding studies were performed on isolated erythrocytes. At therapeutic concentrations (approx. 0.5 microgram/ml in whole blood) greater than 90% of the erythrocyte associated ciclosporin was found in the cytosol. The cytosolic binding capacity was approximately (2-2.5).10(5) molecules of ciclosporin per cell. A lower affinity binding of the drug to the plasma membrane occurred only at higher ciclosporin concentrations. The ciclosporin-binding species was purified from erythrocyte cytosol using ciclosporin-Affigel affinity chromatography. This revealed a 16 kDa protein, similar in size to the ciclosporin-binding protein, cyclophilin, previously identified in lymphocyte cytosol. Immunochemical analysis using rabbit anti-bovine spleen cyclophilin antisera revealed that the erythrocyte ciclosporin-binding protein was either cyclophilin or a closely related protein. It is concluded that intracellular ciclosporin-binding within erythrocytes is mostly attributable to the presence of a single protein or protein family represented by cyclophilin. The presence of (2-2.5).10(5) copies of this binding protein within each erythrocyte is responsible for the ciclosporin found associated with erythrocytes.	eng	447	455	Biochimica et biophysica acta	938	3	1988	Mar	03	D001667;D001798/Q000378;D002352/Q000097;D002846;D003524/Q000097;D003600/Q000378;D004591;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000032;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000648;D006454/Q000032;D006801;D007118;D019696	Binding, Competitive;Blood Proteins/metabolism;Carrier Proteins/blood;Chromatography, Affinity;Cyclosporins/blood;Cytosol/metabolism;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/analysis;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/ultrastructure;Hemoglobins/analysis;Humans;Immunoassay;Peptidylprolyl Isomerase	Foxwell BM;Frazer G;Winters M;Hiestand P;Wenger R;Ryffel B	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
402	2831201	Three distinct forms of type 2A protein phosphatase in human erythrocyte cytosol.	Two type 2A protein phosphatases, phosphatases I (Mr = 180,000) and III (Mr = 177,000), were purified to near homogeneity from human erythrocyte cytosol. Phosphatase I was composed of alpha (34 kDa), beta (63 kDa), and delta (74 kDa) subunits in a ratio of 1:1:1. Phosphatase III comprised alpha, beta, and gamma (53 kDa) subunits in the same ratio. Heparin-Sepharose column chromatography converted most of phosphatase I and 20% of phosphatase III into alpha 1 beta 1 which were indistinguishable from phosphatase IV (Usui, H., Kinohara, N., Yoshikawa, K., Imazu, M., Imaoka, T., and Takeda, M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10455-10463). The catalytic subunit alpha and the beta subunit of phosphatases I, III, and IV displayed identical V8 and papain peptide maps, respectively, while the peptide maps of the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits were clearly distinct. The molar ratio of phosphatases I, III, and IV in erythrocyte cytosol was estimated to be 6:1:14. Comparison of molecular activities of alpha, alpha 1 beta 1, alpha 1 beta 1 delta 1, and alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 1 revealed that beta suppressed phosphorylase and P-H2B histone phosphatase activities of alpha but stimulated the P-H1 histone phosphatase activity, and delta suppressed all the phosphatase activities of alpha 1 beta 1. The gamma subunit stimulated the P-histone phosphatase activity of alpha 1 beta 1 but inhibited the phosphorylase and P-spectrin phosphatase activities. The beta subunit increased the Mg2+ or Mn2+ requirement for P-H2B histone phosphatase activity of alpha, an effect which was counteracted by delta.

A purine 5'-nucleotidase has been separated by DEAE-Trisacryl chromatography from other 5'-nucleotidase activities present in human haemolysates and purified approx. 30,000-fold by subsequent chromatography on Blue Sepharose. The enzyme has an Mr of around 250,000, displays hyperbolic substrate-saturation kinetics and hydrolyses preferentially IMP, GMP and their deoxy counterparts. It is much less active with AMP and dAMP. The purine 5'-nucleotidase is inhibited by Pi, and is strongly stimulated by ATP, dATP and GTP, and by glycerate 2,3-bisphosphate. Stimulators decrease Km and increase Vmax. Glycerate 2,3-bisphosphate is the most potent stimulator of the enzyme and, under physiological conditions, over-rides the influence of the other effectors. Glycerate 2,3-bisphosphate also influences the binding of the enzyme to DEAE-Trisacryl, as evidenced by the different elution profile obtained with fresh as compared with outdated blood. It is concluded that the glycerate 2,3-bisphosphate-stimulated purine 5'-nucleotidase is responsible for the dephosphorylation of IMP and GMP, but not of AMP, in human erythrocytes.	eng	687	696	The Biochemical journal	250	3	1988	Mar	15	D019794;D015720;D000255/Q000494;D002852;D004163/Q000494;D004790/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D066298;D007700;D009708/Q000097;D009708/Q000302;D013379;D013997	2,3-Diphosphoglycerate;5'-Nucleotidase;Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Diphosphoglyceric Acids/pharmacology;Enzyme Induction/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Nucleotidases/blood;Nucleotidases/isolation & purification;Substrate Specificity;Time Factors	Bontemps F;Van den Berghe G;Hers HG	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
404	2970843	Analysis of the phosphofructokinase subunits and isoenzymes in human tissues.	The 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK) subunits and isoenzymes were studied in human muscle, heart, brain, liver, platelets, fibroblasts, erythrocytes, placenta and umbilical cord. In each tissue, the subunit types in the native isoenzymes were characterized by immunological titration with subunit-specific antibodies and by column chromatography on QAE (quaternary aminoethyl)-Sephadex. Further, the subunits of the partially purified native isoenzymes were resolved by SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, identified by immunoblotting, and quantified by scanning gel densitometry of silver-stained gels and immunoblots. Depending on the type of tissue, one to three subunits were detected. The Mr values of the L, M and C subunits regardless of tissue were 76,700 +/- 1400, 82,500 +/- 1640 and 86,500 +/- 1620. Of the tissues studied, only the muscle PFK isoenzymes exhibited one subunit, which was the M-type subunit. Of the other tissues studied, the PFK isoenzymes contained various amounts of all three subunits. Considering the properties of the native PFK isoenzymes, it is clear that, in human tissues, they are not simply various combinations of two or three homotetrameric isoenzymes, but complex mixtures of homotetramers and heterotetramers. The kinetic/regulatory properties of the various isoenzyme pools were found to be dependent on subunit composition.	eng	677	683	The Biochemical journal	251	3	1988	May	01	D000255/Q000494;D000293;D004591;D005636/Q000378;D006801;D007074;D007527/Q000037;D007527/Q000276;D007527/Q000378;D008297;D010732/Q000037;D010732/Q000276;D010732/Q000378;D014018	Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology;Adolescent;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Fructosephosphates/metabolism;Humans;Immunoglobulin G;Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors;Isoenzymes/immunology;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Male;Phosphofructokinase-1/antagonists & inhibitors;Phosphofructokinase-1/immunology;Phosphofructokinase-1/metabolism;Tissue Distribution	Dunaway GA;Kasten TP;Sebo T;Trapp R	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
405	2846554	Sequence of the human erythrocyte phosphoglycerate mutase by microsequencer and mass spectrometry.	We have previously reported the isolation in pure form of the human erythrocyte phosphoglycerate mutase isozyme B. We now report the sequence of the whole protein and the identification of its N-terminal blocking group. The protein tryptic peptides of phosphoglycerate mutase isozyme B were isolated by high performance liquid chromatography and their sequence determined by microsequencing. The sequence and the nature of the blocking group of the N-terminal tryptic peptide was shown to be N-acetyl-Ala-Ala-Tyr-Lys by mass spectrometry. Overlaps of the tryptic peptides were obtained by studying the V8 Staphylococcus aureus protease peptides of the aminoethylated phosphoglycerate mutase isozyme B either by microsequencing or by mass spectrometry. The procedure used allowed us to obtain the sequence on a very small amount of material and in a short period of time. Our data agree well with those derived from the cDNA nucleotide sequence described by Sakoda et al. (Sakoda, S., Shanske, S., DiMauro, S., and Schon, E. A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16899-16905). In addition, our data directly indicate that the initiation codon does not introduce a methionine as N-terminal amino acid and allowed the identification of the acetyl N-terminal group.	eng	16906	16910	The Journal of biological chemistry	263	32	1988	Nov	15	D000595;D001731/Q000032;D002851;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D013058;D008969;D010446/Q000032;D010770/Q000032	Amino Acid Sequence;Bisphosphoglycerate Mutase/analysis;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Mass Spectrometry;Molecular Sequence Data;Peptide Fragments/analysis;Phosphotransferases/analysis	Blouquit Y;Calvin MC;Rosa R;Promé D;Promé JC;Pratbernou F;Cohen-Solal M;Rosa J	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
406	2851048	Asymmetric effects of divalent cations and protons on active Ca2+ efflux and Ca2+-ATPase in intact red blood cells.	The influence of the asymmetric addition of various divalent cations and protons on the properties of active Ca2+ transport have been examined in intact human red blood cells. Active Ca2+ efflux was determined from the initial rate of 45Ca2+ loss after CoCl2 was added to block Ca2+ loading via the ionophore A23187. Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured as phosphate production over 5 min in cells equilibrated with EGTA-buffered free Ca2+ in the presence of A23187. The apparent Ca affinity of active Ca2+ efflux (K0.5 = 30-40 mumol/liter cells) was significantly lower than that measured by the Ca2+-ATPase assay (K0.5 = 0.4 microM). Possible reasons for this apparent difference are considered. Both active Ca2+ efflux and Ca2+-ATPase activity were reduced to less than 5% of maximal levels (20 mmol/liter cells.hr) in Mg2+-depleted cells, and completely restored by reintroduction of intracellular Mg2+. Active Ca2+ efflux was inhibited almost completely by raising external CaCl2 (but not MgCl2) to 20 mM, probably by interaction of Ca2+ at the externally oriented E2P conformation of the pump. Cd2+ was more potent than Ca2+ in this inhibition, while Mn2+ was less potent and 10 mM Ba2+ was without effect. A Ca2+: proton exchange mechanism for active Ca2+ efflux was supported by the results, as external protons (pH 6-6.5) stimulated active Ca2+ efflux at least twofold above the efflux rate at pH 7.8 Ca2+ transport was not affected by decreasing the membrane potential across the red cell.	eng	155	164	The Journal of membrane biology	105	2	1988	Oct		D002118/Q000378;D000252/Q000097;D002413/Q000494;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D008274/Q000494;D008564/Q000187;D011522	Calcium/metabolism;Calcium-Transporting ATPases/blood;Cations, Divalent/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Magnesium/pharmacology;Membrane Potentials/drug effects;Protons	Xu YH;Roufogalis BD	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
407	3204363	Sodium-phosphate cotransport in human red blood cells. Kinetics and role in membrane metabolism.	Orthophosphate (Pi) uptake was examined in human red blood cells at 37 degrees C in media containing physiological concentrations of Pi (1.0-1.5 mM). Cells were shown to transport Pi by a 4,4'-dinitro stilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DNDS) -sensitive pathway (75%), a newly discovered sodium-phosphate (Na/Pi) cotransport pathway (20%), and a pathway linearly dependent on an extracellular phosphate concentration of up to 2.0 mM (5%). Kinetic evaluation of the Na/Pi cotransport pathway determined the K1/2 for activation by extracellular Pi ([Na]o = 140 mM) and extracellular Na [( Pi]o = 1.0 mM) to be 304 +/- 24 microM and 139 +/- 8 mM, respectively. The phosphate influx via the cotransport pathway exhibited a Vmax of 0.63 +/- 0.05 mmol Pi (kg Hb)-1(h)-1 at 140 mM Nao. Activation of Pi uptake by Nao gave Hill coefficients that came close to a value of 1.0. The Vmax of the Na/Pi cotransport varied threefold over the examined pH range (6.90-7.75); however, the Na/Pi stoichiometry of 1.73 +/- 0.15 was constant. The membrane transport inhibitors ouabain, bumetanide, and arsenate had no effect on the magnitude of the Na/Pi cotransport pathway. No difference was found between the rate of incorporation of extracellular Pi into cytosolic orthophosphate and the rate of incorporation into cytosolic nucleotide phosphates, but the rate of incorporation into other cytosolic organic phosphates was significantly slower. Depletion of intracellular total phosphorus inhibited the incorporation of extracellular Pi into the cytosolic nucleotide compartment; and this inhibition was not reversed by repletion of phosphorus to 75% of control levels. Extracellular 32Pi labeled the membrane-associated compounds that migrate on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with the Rf values of ATP and ADP, but not those of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), AMP, or Pi. DNDS had no effect on the level of extracellular phosphate incorporation or on the TLC distribution of Pi in the membrane; however, substitution of extracellular sodium with N-methyl-D-glucamine inhibited phosphorylation of the membranes by 90% and markedly altered the chromatographic pattern of the membrane-associated phosphate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	eng	449	474	The Journal of general physiology	92	4	1988	Oct		D002352/Q000097;D002352/Q000493;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008954;D010710/Q000097;D010710/Q000493;D012964/Q000097;D012964/Q000493;D050608;D027981	Carrier Proteins/blood;Carrier Proteins/pharmacokinetics;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Models, Biological;Phosphates/blood;Phosphates/pharmacokinetics;Sodium/blood;Sodium/pharmacokinetics;Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins;Symporters	Shoemaker DG;Bender CA;Gunn RB	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
408	3240839	Human erythrocyte sorbitol metabolism and the role of sorbitol dehydrogenase.	Rapid fluctuation of erythrocyte sorbitol in response to the changes in plasma glucose concentration has been reported from clinical evidence. We performed more extensive in vitro and in vivo studies focussing on how fast sorbitol was accumulated and how fast the accumulated sorbitol was oxidised in response to the changes in ambient glucose concentration. Incubation studies of intact erythrocytes from healthy subjects and diabetic patients showed that erythrocyte sorbitol increased rapidly in response to increased ambient glucose concentration and the accumulated sorbitol easily decreased according to the rapid reduction of ambient glucose concentration. In addition, the higher the glucose concentration in the medium, the more erythrocytes could accumulate sorbitol. The rapid response of sorbitol levels to ambient glucose concentration was further confirmed by the results of a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test in non-diabetic subjects and diabetic patients with gastrectomy, who showed marked early hyperglycaemia caused by rapid absorption of ingested glucose and subsequent rapid reduction of plasma glucose concentration (erythrocyte sorbitol levels changed concomitantly). These findings strongly indicate that the measurement of erythrocyte sorbitol is not useful as an index of medium or long term glycaemic control.	eng	766	770	Diabetologia	31	10	1988	Oct		D000328;D001786/Q000378;D003920/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D007064/Q000097;D008875;D012016;D013012/Q000097;D013401/Q000097	Adult;Blood Glucose/metabolism;Diabetes Mellitus/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;L-Iditol 2-Dehydrogenase/blood;Middle Aged;Reference Values;Sorbitol/blood;Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases/blood	Nagasaka Y;Fujii S;Kaneko T	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
409	2971139	Abnormal red-cell calcium pump in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria.	Idiopathic hypercalciuria is a common disorder whose inheritance suggests an enzyme abnormality in calcium transport. We measured calcium-magnesium-ATPase activity in erythrocytes from 38 patients (mean age [+/- SEM], 40 +/- 2.1 years) with idiopathic hypercalciuria (24-hour urinary calcium excretion greater than or equal to 0.1 mmol per kilogram of body weight) and a history of multiple calcium oxalate kidney stones. As compared with 41 healthy controls, the patients with hypercalciuria had increased erythrocyte-membrane calcium-magnesium-ATPase activity (64.2 +/- 2.19 vs. 51.6 +/- 1.91 nmol of ATP split per milligram per minute; P less than 0.01) and increased sodium-potassium pump activity (6866 +/- 233 vs. 6096 +/- 228 mumol of sodium per liter of red cells per hour; P less than 0.05). No significant difference between the two groups was found in erythrocyte sodium-potassium cotransport, sodium-lithium countertransport, or potassium content. In 66 patients with kidney stones (38 with hypercalciuria and 28 with normal calcium excretion), 24-hour urinary calcium excretion correlated with calcium-magnesium-ATPase activity (r = 0.46, P less than 0.001). Erythrocyte calcium-magnesium-ATPase activity remained unchanged in eight subjects studied after four months on a low-calcium diet. A study of 30 healthy families found significant correlations between mean values in parents and those in offspring for calcium-magnesium-ATPase (r = 0.68, P less than 0.001) and urinary calcium excretion (r = 0.45, P less than 0.02), with no significant correlations between parents with respect to these measures (r = 0.27 and r = 0.08, respectively). We conclude that abnormalities in erythrocyte calcium-magnesium-ATPase activity may represent an inherited defect in calcium transport related to the cause of idiopathic hypercalciuria.	eng	897	901	The New England journal of medicine	319	14	1988	Oct	06	D000328;D001692;D017301/Q000097;D002118/Q000097;D002118/Q000652;D000252/Q000097;D002648;D004910/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007669/Q000209;D007669/Q000378;D007700;D008297;D011188/Q000097;D012964/Q000097	Adult;Biological Transport;Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase/blood;Calcium/blood;Calcium/urine;Calcium-Transporting ATPases/blood;Child;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Female;Humans;Kidney Calculi/etiology;Kidney Calculi/metabolism;Kinetics;Male;Potassium/blood;Sodium/blood	Bianchi G;Vezzoli G;Cusi D;Cova T;Elli A;Soldati L;Tripodi G;Surian M;Ottaviano E;Rigatti P	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

The transfer of retinol across and between bilayer membranes was studied in vitro using unilamellar liposomes and erythrocytes. Transmembrane movement of retinol in phospholipid bilayer membranes was a spontaneous and rapid process with a halflife of less than 30 s. Retinol transfer between liposomes and between liposomes and erythrocytes was also a spontaneous and rapid process with a halflife of less than 10 min.

411	3196289	Modification of the glyoxalase system in human red blood cells by glucose in vitro.	The human red-blood-cell glyoxalase system was modified by incubation with high concentrations of glucose in vitro. Red-blood-cell suspensions (50%, v/v) were incubated with 5 mM- and 25 mM-glucose to model normal and hyperglycaemic glucose metabolism. There was an increase in the flux of methylglyoxal metabolized to D-lactic acid via the glyoxalase pathway with high glucose concentration. The increase was approximately proportional to initial glucose concentration over the range studied (5-100 mM). The activities of glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II were not significantly changed, but the concentrations of the glyoxalase substrates, methylglyoxal and S-D-lactoylglutathione, and the percentage of glucotriose metabolized via the glyoxalase pathway, were significantly increased. The increase in the flux of intermediates metabolized via the glyoxalase pathway during periodic hyperglycaemia may be a biochemical factor involved in the development of chronic clinical complications associated with diabetes mellitus.	eng	751	755	The Biochemical journal	254	3	1988	Sep	15	D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D005947/Q000494;D005978/Q000031;D005978/Q000097;D006801;D006943/Q000097;D006943/Q000201;D066298;D007773/Q000097;D019344;D007791/Q000097;D008190/Q000097;D008954;D011765/Q000097;D014312/Q000097	Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glucose/pharmacology;Glutathione/analogs & derivatives;Glutathione/blood;Humans;Hyperglycemia/blood;Hyperglycemia/enzymology;In Vitro Techniques;Lactates/blood;Lactic Acid;Lactoylglutathione Lyase/blood;Lyases/blood;Models, Biological;Pyruvaldehyde/blood;Trisaccharides/blood	Thornalley PJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True

"A procedure has been developed for the purification of phosphoglucomutase from human red cell (phenotype PGM1 a1 or a3) lysates. It yields homogeneous isoenzyme preparations of the products (""primary"" and ""secondary"") of the two PGM1 and PGM2 loci with distinctive pI (from 6.07 to 5.29). There are substantial differences between PGM1 and PGM2 isoenzymes, having single polypeptide chains of 58,500 and 69,000 Mr respectively and showing different thermostability. The kinetic properties of all the isoenzymes for the phosphoglucomutase reaction are essentially the same (apart from the specific activity of 1089-1263 units/mg for PGM1 forms vs 37-42 units/mg for PGM2 forms), but there are striking differences in substrate specificity. In fact the products of PGM1 locus are ""true"" phosphoglucomutases, being specific to mutate glucose monophosphates, whereas the PGM2 forms also display phosphoribomutase and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate synthetic activities.

413	2776714	Aldehyde dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes: structural relationship to the liver cytosolic isozyme.	Human red cell aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) resembles the liver cytosolic isozyme in numerous physicochemical properties. This study was undertaken to establish the structural relationship between the erythrocyte and liver ALDH isozymes. The purified red cell ALDH was S-(14C)-carboxymethylated, and cleaved with trypsin. The tryptic digest was fractionated using Sephadex and reversed-phase chromatography. All peptides analyzed were identified within the liver cytosolic enzyme structure. In each case the sequence obtained corresponds exactly to a segment from the human liver cytosolic ALDH. Thus, the erythrocyte enzyme, by virtue of its chemical and structural identity with the liver cytosolic enzyme, may serve as a suitable peripheral enzyme model to understand the cause and mechanism of alcohol abuse-related changes in liver cytosolic ALDH that has been found to be reduced in alcoholics.	eng	47	52	Enzyme	42	1	1989			D000444/Q000097;D000444/Q000378;D000595;D000596/Q000032;D002851;D003600/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007527/Q000097;D007527/Q000378;D008099/Q000201;D008969;D015394	Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/blood;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Amino Acids/analysis;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Isoenzymes/blood;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Liver/enzymology;Molecular Sequence Data;Molecular Structure	Agarwal DP;Cohn P;Goedde HW;Hempel J	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
414	2725076	Glyoxalase activity in human red blood cells fractioned by age.	Human red blood cells were fractionated by density, which correlates with cell age, and the activities of glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II were determined for each fraction. The activity of glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II both significantly increased during maturation of the red blood cells (P less than 0.001), except in the most dense, old cell fraction where both glyoxalase activities decreased. The increase in glyoxalase activity from the reticulocyte-rich fraction to mature erythrocytes was substantial and markedly different from other glycolytic enzymes which typically decrease. This suggests that glyoxalase activity changes markedly during and probably after the maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes. The decrease in glyoxalase activity from the mature to old red blood cell fractions may be caused by oxidative inactivation of glyoxalases. The decreased capacity to metabolise methylglyoxal may be an important factor in red blood cell senesence. This is expected to be particularly important in diabetes mellitus where the rate of methylglyoxal formation is increased during hyperglycaemia.	eng	63	71	Mechanisms of ageing and development	48	1	1989	Apr		D004905;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007791/Q000097;D008190/Q000097;D012156/Q000201	Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Lactoylglutathione Lyase/blood;Lyases/blood;Reticulocytes/enzymology	McLellan AC;Thornalley PJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True

A single step immunoaffinity purification procedure for human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase is described which permitted the isolation of milligram quantities of enzyme from 10 U of erythrocytes, with 113,000-fold purification and a yield of about 22%. In SDS-PAGE analysis, the enzyme corresponds to a disulfide linked dimer of 140 kDa which is converted to a 70 kDa monomer upon disulfide reduction. The tryptic peptides generated from purified enzyme were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Five of these peptides were analysed to determine the amino acid sequences. The obtained sequences showed no homology to the already known amino acid sequences for human serum and brain butyrylcholinesterase and Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase.	eng	279	282	FEBS letters	247	2	1989	Apr	24	D000110/Q000097;D000595;D002846;D002851;D004591;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007118;D046911;D008969;D010446/Q000302;D012689;D014357	Acetylcholinesterase/blood;Amino Acid Sequence;Chromatography, Affinity;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Immunoassay;Macromolecular Substances;Molecular Sequence Data;Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification;Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid;Trypsin	Chhajlani V;Derr D;Earles B;Schmell E;August T	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
416	2762302	Tetrahydrobiopterin, the cofactor for aromatic amino acid hydroxylases, is synthesized by and regulates proliferation of erythroid cells.	The only known role for 6(R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is as the cofactor for the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. However, BH4 has been shown to be synthesized by cells that do not contain any hydroxylase activity, suggesting that it may have still undiscovered functions. Our finding of much higher levels of BH4 and GTP cyclohydrolase, the first enzyme of de novo BH4 biosynthesis, in rat reticulocytes compared to mature erythrocytes raised the possibility that BH4 might play a role in erythrocyte maturation. We have now demonstrated, by using murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells as a model for erythrogenesis, that BH4 synthesis is required for proliferation of these cells. Inhibition of BH4 biosynthesis in rapidly dividing MEL cells with N-acetylserotonin, a potent inhibitor of sepiapterin reductase, the terminal enzyme in the BH4 biosynthetic pathway, results in inhibition of DNA synthesis and mitogenesis without induction of hemoglobin synthesis. The inhibition of DNA synthesis is reversed by repletion of cellular BH4 levels with sepiapterin, a pterin that is readily taken up by the cells and converted to BH4 by the sequential reductions of sepiapterin reductase and dihydrofolate reductase. Treatment of MEL cells with hexamethylene bisacetamide, an inducer of differentiation, results in a decrease in BH4 synthesis accompanied by a cessation of growth and concomitant hemoglobin synthesis. The inhibition of proliferation induced by hexamethylene bisacetamide can be reversed by maintaining high intracellular levels of BH4, which also decreases the amount of hemoglobin. The mechanism of the BH4 effect has not yet been elucidated, but it appears as though BH4 synthesis is more intimately linked with cell proliferation than with the differentiation process.	eng	5864	5867	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	86	15	1989	Aug		D000081/Q000494;D000818;D001708/Q000031;D001708/Q000096;D001708/Q000097;D001708/Q000502;D002454/Q000187;D002455;D002460;D004261;D006136/Q000097;D007700;D004915;D051379;D051381;D011919	Acetamides/pharmacology;Animals;Biopterins/analogs & derivatives;Biopterins/biosynthesis;Biopterins/blood;Biopterins/physiology;Cell Differentiation/drug effects;Cell Division;Cell Line;DNA Replication;GTP Cyclohydrolase/blood;Kinetics;Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute;Mice;Rats;Rats, Inbred Strains	Tanaka K;Kaufman S;Milstien S	Journal, Articles							Erythro;erythrocyte;erythro	True
417	2630803	Metabolic dynamics in the human red cell. Part I--A comprehensive kinetic model.	The experimental investigation of the red cell over the last three decades has accumulated extensive biochemical data on its enzymes and metabolites. The goal of this work is to provide a unified theoretical framework for the integration and consistent interpretation of these data by means of a comprehensive mathematical metabolic model of the red cell. This model is described in four parts. Here, we describe the general conception, scope and the biological assumptions of the model. The model is comprised of dynamic mass balances based on stoichiometry and enzyme kinetics with the imposed physico-chemical constraints of osmotic balance and electroneutrality.	eng	515	528	Journal of theoretical biology	141	4	1989	Dec	19	D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008433;D008954	Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Mathematics;Models, Biological	Joshi A;Palsson BO	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True
418	2630804	Metabolic dynamics in the human red cell. Part II--Interactions with the environment.	The maintenance of human red cell volume under multitude of trying physiological conditions is a self regulated dynamic process. Theoretical and experimental studies on red cell osmotic states have been primarily focussed on three different interdependent areas: the permeative properties of the red cell membrane, the kinetic studies of transmembrane fluxes of various ionic and nonionic chemical constituents of the red cell and plasma, and the ideal and non-ideal thermodynamic formulation of the osmotic states. The primary objective of this work is to provide a general model that converges the above mentioned components of the red cell and its environment under one umbrella. Such a model facilitates the simultaneous interpretation and prediction of quantitative changes in the red cell volume, pH, Donnan ratios, osmotic effects, plasma volume, transmembrane fluxes, and permeable and impermeable solute concentration.	eng	529	545	Journal of theoretical biology	141	4	1989	Dec	19	D004912/Q000378;D006801;D008564;D008954;D009994;D013312	Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Membrane Potentials;Models, Biological;Osmolar Concentration;Stress, Physiological	Joshi A;Palsson BO	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True
419	2540502	Inositol-1-phosphatase of human erythrocytes is inhibited by therapeutic lithium concentrations.	Lithium is widely used in psychiatric chemotherapy and is especially effective in the treatment of manic-depressive illness (MDI), but the mechanism for its therapeutic properties and side effects remains to be elucidated. One of the possibilities relates to the inhibitory effect of Li+ on inositol-1-phosphatase (I-1-P'ase) activity. Indeed, the concentration of inositol-1-phosphate (I-1-P) after treatment with Li+ was shown to be increased in various mammalian cells. Yet, no direct study of I-1-P'ase activity in human cells has been reported. Erythrocytes are readily accessible for routine studies and could facilitate the investigation of I-1-P'ase as affected by Li+ in relation to MDI. It is now shown that I-1-P'ase can be measured in lysate of human erythrocytes, using a small blood sample. The enzymatic activity is localized in the soluble fraction. The Km for I-1-P is 0.14 mM. Intriguingly, the Ki for Li+ is 0.86 mM, within the range of therapeutic concentrations in MDI patients.	eng	217	224	Psychiatry research	27	2	1989	Feb		D001714/Q000201;D004305;D004912/Q000187;D006801;D008094/Q000493;D008094/Q000494;D010744/Q000037	Bipolar Disorder/enzymology;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Humans;Lithium/pharmacokinetics;Lithium/pharmacology;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors	Agam G;Livne A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
420	2703819	Na- and Cl-dependent glycine transport in human red blood cells and ghosts. A study of the binding of substrates to the outward-facing carrier.	Na- and Cl-dependent glycine transport was investigated in human red blood cells. The effects of the carrier substrates (Na, Cl, and glycine) on the glycine transport kinetics were studied with the goal of learning more about the mechanism of transport. The K1/2-gly was 100 microM and the Vmax-gly was 109 mumol/kg Hb.h. When cis Na was lowered (50 mM) the K1/2-gly increased and the Vmax-gly decreased, which was consistent with a preferred order of rapid equilibrium loading of glycine before Na. Na-dependent glycine influx as a function of Na concentration was sigmoidal, and direct measurement of glycine and Na uptake indicated a stoichiometry of 2 Na:1 glycine transported. The sigmoidal response of glycine influx to Na concentration was best fit by a model with ordered binding of Na, the first Na with a high K1/2 (greater than 250 mM), and the second Na with a low K1/2 (less than 10.3 mM). In the presence of low Cl (cis and trans 5 mM), the K1/2-gly increased and the Vmax-gly increased. The Cl dependence displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a K1/2-Cl of 9.5 mM. At low Cl (5 mM Cl balanced with NO3), the glycine influx as a function of Na showed the same stoichiometry and Vmax-Na but a decreased affinity of the carrier for Na. These data suggested that Cl binds to the carrier before Na. Experiments comparing influx and efflux rates of transport using red blood cell ghosts indicated a functional asymmetry of the transporter. Under the same gradient conditions, Na- and Cl-dependent glycine transport functioned in both directions across the membrane but rates of efflux were 50% greater than rates of influx. In addition, the presence of trans substrates modified influx and efflux differently. Trans glycine largely inhibited glycine efflux in the absence or presence of trans Na; trans Na largely inhibited glycine influx and this inhibition was partially reversed when trans glycine was also present. A model for the binding of these substrates to the outward-facing carrier is presented.	eng	321	342	The Journal of general physiology	93	2	1989	Feb		D001692/Q000187;D002712/Q000502;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005998/Q000502;D006801;D007700;D012964/Q000502	Biological Transport/drug effects;Chlorides/physiology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycine/physiology;Humans;Kinetics;Sodium/physiology	King PA;Gunn RB	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
421	2919129	Abnormality of odd-numbered long-chain fatty acids in erythrocyte membrane lipids from patients with disorders of propionate metabolism.	In propionic acidemia and methylmalonic aciduria, disorders of propionate catabolism, excess intracellular propionyl-CoA leads to an enhanced synthesis of odd-numbered long-chain fatty acids. Red cell membrane lipids of patients with these disorders contain pentadecanoic, heptadecanoic, and heptadecenoic acids in excess of normal levels. The odd-numbered long-chain fatty acid content may reflect individual differences in severity of these disorders as well as the degree of effective dietary control. It might be a useful long term parameter for determining the effectiveness of clinical management.	eng	147	150	Pediatric research	25	2	1989	Feb		D000293;D000328;D002648;D002675;D004910/Q000032;D005227/Q000032;D006801;D007223;D007231;D008314/Q000652;D008563/Q000032;D008661/Q000097;D008764/Q000652;D010713/Q000032;D010714/Q000032;D011422/Q000097;D011422/Q000378	Adolescent;Adult;Child;Child, Preschool;Erythrocyte Membrane/analysis;Fatty Acids/analysis;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Malonates/urine;Membrane Lipids/analysis;Metabolism, Inborn Errors/blood;Methylmalonic Acid/urine;Phosphatidylcholines/analysis;Phosphatidylethanolamines/analysis;Propionates/blood;Propionates/metabolism	Wendel U	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;Red cell	True
422	2722838	Purified human erythrocyte pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase. Preferential oxidation of NADPH.	Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase catalyzes the final step in proline synthesis by NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of pyrroline-5-carboxylate. We have purified and characterized this enzyme from human erythrocytes. Purification to homogeneity (approximately 600,000-fold) was accomplished by sonication, ultracentrifugation, 2',5'-ADP-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange chromatography. The enzyme runs as a single band of 30,000 Mr on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sizing chromatography under nondenaturating conditions demonstrates activity in the 300,000-350,000 Mr range, suggesting that the native enzyme exists as a 10- to 12-mer. The purified enzyme exhibits kinetic characteristics similar to those previously described for whole red cell homogenates. The Vmax is 10-fold higher and the Km for pyrroline-5-carboxylate is 7-fold higher with NADH versus NADPH as cofactor. The affinity for NADPH is 15-fold higher than that for NADH. Erythrocyte pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is competitively inhibited by NADP+. Unlike the enzyme from some other sources, erythrocyte pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is not inhibited by proline or ATP. Double label studies using [14C]pyrroline-5-carboxylate and [3H]exNADPH in the presence of both NADH and NADPH were performed to determine the preferred source of reducing equivalents. In the presence of physiologic concentrations of pyrroline-5-carboxylate and both pyridine nucleotides, all of the reducing equivalents came from NADPH. We suggest that, in some cell types including human erythrocytes, a physiologic function of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase is the generation of NADP+.	eng	9352	9358	The Journal of biological chemistry	264	16	1989	Jun	05	D050842;D004789;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008970;D009243/Q000378;D009243/Q000502;D009249/Q000378;D009249/Q000502;D010084;D000587/Q000097;D000587/Q000302;D000587/Q000502;D011392/Q000096;D011392/Q000302	1-Pyrroline-5-Carboxylate Dehydrogenase;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;NAD/metabolism;NAD/physiology;NADP/metabolism;NADP/physiology;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/blood;Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/isolation & purification;Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/physiology;Proline/biosynthesis;Proline/isolation & purification	Merrill MJ;Yeh GC;Phang JM	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
423	2541250	Kinetics and stoichiometry of the human red cell Na+/H+ exchanger.	We have investigated the kinetic properties of the human red blood cell Na+/H+ exchanger to provide a tool to study the role of genetic, hormonal and environmental factors in its expression as well as its functional properties in several clinical conditions. The present study reports its stoichiometry and the kinetic effects of internal H+ (Hi) and external Na+ (Nao) in red blood cells of normal subjects. Red blood cells with different cell Na+ (Nai) and pH (pHi) were prepared by nystatin and DIDS treatment of acid-loaded cells. Unidirectional and net Na+ influx were measured by varying pHi (from 5.7 to 7.4), external pH (pHo), Nai and Nao and by incubating the cells in media containing ouabain, bumetanide and methazolamide. Net Na+ influx (Nai less than 2.0 mmol/liter cell, Nao = 150 mM) increased sigmoidally (Hill coefficient 2.5) when pHi fell below 7.0 and the external pHo was 8.0, but increased linearly at pHo 6.0. The net Na+ influx driven by an outward H+ gradient was estimated from the difference of Na+ influx at the two pHo levels (pHo 8 and pHo 6). The H+-driven Na+ influx reached saturation between pHi 5.9 and 6.1. The Vmax had a wide interindividual variation (6 to 63 mmol/liter cell.hr, 31.0 +/- 3, mean +/- SEM, n = 20). The Km for Hi to activate H+-driven Na+ influx was 347 +/- 30 nM (n = 7). Amiloride (1 mM) or DMA (20 microM) partially (59 +/- 10%) inhibited red cell Na+/H+ exchange. The stoichiometric ratio between H+-driven Na+ influx and Na+-driven H+ efflux was 1:1. The dependence of Na+ influx from Nao was studied at pHi 6.0, and Nai lower than 2 mmol/liter cell at pHo 6.0 and 8.0. The mean Km for Nao of the H+-gradient-driven Na+ influx was 55 +/- 7 mM. An increase in Nai from 2 to 20 mmol/liter cell did not change significantly H+-driven net Na+ influx as estimated from the difference between unidirectional 22Na influx and efflux. Na+/Na+ exchange was negligible in acid-loaded, DIDS-treated cells. Na+ and H+ efflux from acid-loaded cells were inhibited by amiloride analogs in the absence of external Na+ indicating that they may represent nonspecific effects of these compounds and/or uncoupled transport modes of the Na+/H+ exchanger. It is concluded that human red cell Na+/H+ exchange performs 1:1 exchange of external Na+ for internal protons, which is partially amiloride sensitive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	eng	219	228	The Journal of membrane biology	107	3	1989	Mar		D000328;D000584/Q000494;D001693/Q000187;D002352/Q000097;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D006863;D066298;D007700;D008297;D008875;D012964/Q000097;D017923	Adult;Amiloride/pharmacology;Biological Transport, Active/drug effects;Carrier Proteins/blood;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Male;Middle Aged;Sodium/blood;Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers	Semplicini A;Spalvins A;Canessa M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell;Red blood cell	True
424	2538472	Characterization and purification of membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate kinase from human red blood cells.	The membrane-bound form of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdInsP) kinase was purified 4,300-fold from human red blood cells to a specific activity of 117 nmol min-1 mg-1. Although this enzyme copurified with red blood cell membranes, it was solubilized by high salt extraction in the absence of detergent indicating that it is a peripheral membrane protein. The major protein seen in the most purified preparation migrated at 53,000 daltons on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The major PtdInsP kinase activity in this preparation was also coincident with this 53,000-dalton band upon renaturation of activity from SDS-PAGE. To test further whether the 53,000-dalton protein contained PtdInsP kinase activity, antibodies were prepared against the gel-purified 53,000-dalton protein. This antiserum was able to precipitate both the 53,000-dalton peptide and PtdInsP kinase activity from red blood cell membranes. The apparent size of the native enzyme in the most purified preparation was determined to be 150,000 +/- 25,000 daltons by gel filtration. This PtdInsP kinase activity was at least 100-fold more active in phosphorylating PtdInsP than phosphatidylinositol and was easily separated from the red cell membrane phosphatidylinositol kinase by salt extraction. Analysis of the reaction product, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, indicates that the enzyme phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate specifically at the 5'-hydroxyl of the inositol ring. The apparent Km for ATP was 2 microM, and the concentrations of Mg2+ and Mn2+ giving half-maximal activity were 2 and 0.2 mM, respectively. Mg2+ supported 3-fold higher activity than Mn2+ at optimal concentrations. The enzymatic activity was inhibited by its product, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and enhanced by phosphatidylserine.	eng	5080	5088	The Journal of biological chemistry	264	9	1989	Mar	25	D000255/Q000502;D002413;D002850;D004591;D004910/Q000201;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008565/Q000097;D008565/Q000276;D008565/Q000378;D008970;D010716/Q000502;D010766;D010770/Q000276;D010770/Q000302;D010770/Q000378;D017853;D011233;D012967	Adenosine Triphosphate/physiology;Cations, Divalent;Chromatography, Gel;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Membrane Proteins/blood;Membrane Proteins/immunology;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Molecular Weight;Phosphatidylinositols/physiology;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases/immunology;Phosphotransferases/isolation & purification;Phosphotransferases/metabolism;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor);Precipitin Tests;Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate	Ling LE;Schulz JT;Cantley LC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
425	2722775	Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in human red blood cell membrane preparations. Kinetic mechanism.	The successive methylations of phosphatidylethanolamine to form phosphatidylcholine were measured using exogenously added intermediates and membrane preparations from human red blood cells. The addition of phosphatidylethanolamine resulted in no increase in methylation rate over that with endogenous substrate; however, the addition of monomethylphosphatidylethanolamine (PME) and dimethylphosphatidylethanolamine (PDE) markedly increased the reaction rate and allowed studies into the kinetic mechanism for the second and third methylation reactions. The data are consistent with catalysis of the last two methylations being by a single enzyme with a random Bi-Bi sequential mechanism. Analysis of PDE:phosphatidylcholine product ratios indicates that the enzyme can conduct multiple methylations of enzyme-bound phospholipid. The nature of the acyl chain (16:0 versus 18:1) of the phospholipid had only a small effect on the value of the kinetic constants. The maximal velocities obtained with the 18:1 substrate were less than 5% lower than those obtained with the 16:0 substrate. The Km values for the two phospholipids were 20-45 and 10-14 microM for the methylation of PME and PDE, respectively. The Km for S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) was 5-9 microM with PME and 4 microM with PDE as substrates. Depending on the acyl chain and the phospholipid, the Ki(AdoMet) varied from 8 to 19 microM, the Ki(PME) from 41 to 82 microM, and the Ki(PDE) from 35 to 61 microM. The Ki for S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) was between 1.0 and 1.4 microM depending upon the variable substrate. The endogenous concentrations of PME and PDE in red blood cell membranes were estimated to be 0.49 and 0.24 mumol/liter packed cells, respectively. The product from the utilization of AdoMet, S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of its precursor, AdoMet, and a noncompetitive inhibitor of the two phospholipid substrates.	eng	8097	8106	The Journal of biological chemistry	264	14	1989	May	15	D000328;D004910/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008297;D008745;D008780/Q000097;D010713/Q000097;D050918;D010714/Q000097;D012435/Q000097;D012436/Q000097	Adult;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Male;Methylation;Methyltransferases/blood;Phosphatidylcholines/blood;Phosphatidylethanolamine N-Methyltransferase;Phosphatidylethanolamines/blood;S-Adenosylhomocysteine/blood;S-Adenosylmethionine/blood	Reitz RC;Mead DJ;Bjur RA;Greenhouse AH;Welch WH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
426	2484233	Cadmium uptake kinetics in human erythrocytes.	Cross-membrane transport of cadmium in human erythrocytes was studied using 109Cd+(+) and liquid scintillation counting. Uptake rates were determined by depletion of radioactivity in the incubation medium and the amount of hemolyzate radioactivity taken up by the erythrocytes. Both saturable and nonsaturable components for cadmium transport were observed. The mean maximum uptake rate (Jmax) of the saturable component was 4.9 X 10(-6) mol/L/h. The transport constant (Kt) was estimated at 6.9 X 10(-5) mol/L. The diffusion constant (Kd) of the non-saturable component was 1.4 X 10(-2)/h. Both Jmax and Kt of cadmium generally decreased when Zn+(+) was present, with a biphasic response in the presence of Cu+(+). Kd of cadmium increased as Zn+(+) or Cu+(+) levels were increased. It is suggested that cadmium may penetrate human red cells via cation transport sites owing to its behavior as an analog of one or more nutrient species.	eng	119	129	Biological trace element research	22	2	1989	Nov		D001693;D002104/Q000097;D002104/Q000493;D002106;D003300/Q000097;D004058;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D015032/Q000378	Biological Transport, Active;Cadmium/blood;Cadmium/pharmacokinetics;Cadmium Radioisotopes;Copper/blood;Diffusion;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Zinc/metabolism	Nguyen QH;Chien PK	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

428	2790058	Phosphoglucoisomerase-catalyzed interconversion of hexose phosphates; comparison with phosphomannoisomerase.	The isotopic discrimination, diastereotopic specificity and intramolecular hydrogen transfer characterizing the reaction catalyzed by phosphomannoisomerase are examined. During the monodirectional conversion of D-[2-3H]mannose 6-phosphate to D-fructose 6-phosphate and D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the reaction velocity is one order of magnitude lower than with D-[U-14C]mannose 6-phosphate and little tritium (less than 6%) is transferred intramolecularly. Inorganic phosphate decreases the reaction velocity but favours the intramolecular transfer of tritium. Likewise, when D-[1-3H]fructose 6-phosphate prepared from D-[1-3H]glucose is exposed solely to phosphomannoisomerase, the generation of tritiated metabolites is virtually restricted to 3H2O and occurs at a much lower rate than the production of D-[U-14C]mannose 6-phosphate from D-[U-14C]fructose 6-phosphate. However, no 3H2O is formed when D-[1-3H]fructose 6-phosphate generated from D-[2-3H]glucose is exposed to phosphomannoisomerase, indicating that the diastereotopic specificity of the latter enzyme represents a mirror image of that of phosphoglucoisomerase. Advantage is taken of such a contrasting enzymic behaviour to assess the back-and-forth flow through the reaction catalyzed by phosphomannoisomerase in intact cells exposed to D-[1-3H]glucose, D-[5-3H]glucose or D-[6-3H]glucose. Relative to the rate of glycolysis, this back-and-forth flow amounted to approx. 4% in human erythrocytes and rat parotid cells, 9% in tumoral cells of the RINm5F line and 47% in rat pancreatic islets.	eng	118	125	Biochimica et biophysica acta	998	2	1989	Oct	05	D000818;D002238/Q000378;D002478;D005636/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D005956/Q000378;D006600/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D008359/Q000378;D008360/Q000378;D051381;D014316;D015003/Q000201	Animals;Carbohydrate Epimerases/metabolism;Cells, Cultured;Fructosephosphates/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Glucose-6-Phosphate Isomerase/metabolism;Hexosephosphates/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Mannose-6-Phosphate Isomerase/metabolism;Mannosephosphates/metabolism;Rats;Tritium;Yeasts/enzymology	Malaisse-Lagae F;Liemans V;Yaylali B;Sener A;Malaisse WJ	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
429	2075724	[Testing the activity of enzymes responsible for biosynthesis of purine nucleotides AIR-carboxylase and SAICAR-synthetase in human cell extracts].	Activities of AIR-carboxylase (ES 4.1.1.21) and SAICAR-synthetase (EC 6.3.2.6) were found in lysates of human erythrocytes, thrombocytes and leukocytes and in homogenate of the stomach biopsy sample. However, these activities were absent in blood plasma and bile. The human erythrocyte enzyme preparation, which had both activities, was isolated and purified about 200 times. The copurification of both activities and properties of the enzyme preparation suggest that two consecutive reactions of purine biosynthesis de novo (from AIR to SAICAR) in human cells are catalyzed by one bifunctional enzyme which is probably encoded by one gene.	rus	59	63	Voprosy meditsinskoi khimii	36	6	1990			D019731;D002850;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008025/Q000097;D010453/Q000097;D011685/Q000096	Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases;Chromatography, Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Ligases/blood;Peptide Synthases/blood;Purine Nucleotides/biosynthesis	Alenin VV;Iakovleva MF;Bystrova IM;Zazerskaia IA;Domkin VD	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
430	2079837	Relationship between plasma and red cell biopterins in acute and chronic hyperphenylalaninaemia.	Biopterin concentrations in red blood cells were higher in patients with chronic hyperphenylalaninaemia than following a single oral dose of phenylalanine, although the plasma concentrations were similar. These findings suggest that tetrahydrobiopterin is synthesized in immature red blood cells in response to hyperphenylalaninaemia. The less marked increase in plasma biopterin suggests slow release from a tissue reservoir. The maintenance of a differential between erythrocyte and plasma biopterin concentrations suggests that some mechanism retains biopterin intracellularly.	eng	883	887	Journal of inherited metabolic disease	13	6	1990			D000208;D000328;D001708/Q000097;D002908;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D010649/Q000097;D010661/Q000097;D010661/Q000178;D010949/Q000378;D012016	Acute Disease;Adult;Biopterins/blood;Chronic Disease;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Phenylalanine/blood;Phenylketonurias/blood;Phenylketonurias/diet therapy;Plasma/metabolism;Reference Values	Leeming RJ;Hall SK;Surplice IM;Green A	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
431	2159925	The metabolism of ribavirin in erythrocytes and nucleated cells.	1. The metabolism of the broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin was examined in intact human erythrocytes, cultured skin fibroblasts and EBV-transformed lymphoblasts. At an extracellular ribavirin concentration of 35 microM all the cell types produced ribavirin mono-, di- and triphosphate, with the nucleotide concentration reaching half-maximum in 210, 245 and 267 min for fibroblasts, lymphoblasts and erythrocytes, respectively. The ratio of mono-, di- and triphosphates was ca 4:1:40 in fibroblasts, 3:1:8 in lymphoblasts and 1:5:17 in erythrocytes. 2. When ribavirin was removed from the medium, the half-life of ribavirin nucleotides was less than 2 hr in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts, but greater than 24 hr in erythrocytes. 3. In energy-starved erythrocytes, the catabolism of ribavirin nucleotides closely followed the catabolism of adenine nucleotides. 4. None of these cell types excreted appreciable amounts of the ribavirin catabolites triazole carboxamide, triazole carboxylate or triazole carboxylate ribonucleoside. 5. Cells deficient in adenosine kinase produced greater than 4% of the ribavirin nucleotides of normal controls. 6. The nucleated cells quickly hydrolyzed ribavirin 5'monophosphate to ribavirin, whereas this activity was negligible in erythrocytes.	eng	379	383	The International journal of biochemistry	22	4	1990			D002467/Q000378;D002472;D002478;D004912/Q000378;D005347/Q000378;D006207;D004854;D006801;D006868;D066298;D008214/Q000378;D009711/Q000378;D012254/Q000031;D012254/Q000097;D012254/Q000378;D012263/Q000378	Cell Nucleus/metabolism;Cell Transformation, Viral;Cells, Cultured;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fibroblasts/metabolism;Half-Life;Herpesvirus 4, Human;Humans;Hydrolysis;In Vitro Techniques;Lymphocytes/metabolism;Nucleotides/metabolism;Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives;Ribavirin/blood;Ribavirin/metabolism;Ribonucleosides/metabolism	Page T;Connor JD	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
432	2107886	Partial purification and properties of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase from human erythrocytes: evidence that enzyme activity is a sensitive indicator of lead exposure.	We have examined properties of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthetase from human erythrocytes. The enzyme was found to be cold labile and extremely unstable in crude hemolysate, with complete loss of activity occurring after 24 hours at 4 degrees C. However, maintenance of crude hemolysate at 20 to 25 degrees C in the presence of EDTA and KCl increased NAD synthetase stability substantially (half-life = 10 days). Using these conditions, NAD synthetase was purified 3,100-fold with a 29% yield using DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and dialysis. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants for nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD), adenosine triphosphate, Mg2+, glutamine, and K+ were 0.108, 0.154, 1.36, 2.17, and 8.32 mmol/L, respectively. The pH optimum ranged between 6.8 and 7.4, and the molecular weight was estimated to be 483 +/- 5 Kd. The enzyme was markedly inhibited by Pb2+ and Zn2+, with concentrations necessary for 50% inhibition of activity of 1.3 and 2.0 mumol/L, respectively. The incubation of intact red blood cells with lead followed by rigorous washing to remove lead abolished nearly all NAD synthetase activity. In contrast, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, which is not sensitive to lead, was unaffected, whereas pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase activity, which is sensitive to lead, was decreased 30% to 50% under these conditions. More importantly, patients with lead overburden (34 to 72 micrograms Pb2+/dL blood) all had markedly decreased NAD synthetase activity. These data together with other results suggest that erythrocyte NAD synthetase activity is a sensitive indicator of lead exposure in humans.	eng	1576	1582	Blood	75	7	1990	Apr	01	D019732;D015415/Q000097;D002848;D004492/Q000494;D004795;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D005978/Q000494;D006801;D007700;D007854/Q000494;D007855/Q000097;D007855/Q000175;D007855/Q000201;D008025/Q000037;D008025/Q000097;D008025/Q000302;D008297;D008970;D009942/Q000494;D012016;D015032/Q000494	Amide Synthases;Biomarkers/blood;Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose;Edetic Acid/pharmacology;Enzyme Stability;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Glutathione/pharmacology;Humans;Kinetics;Lead/pharmacology;Lead Poisoning/blood;Lead Poisoning/diagnosis;Lead Poisoning/enzymology;Ligases/antagonists & inhibitors;Ligases/blood;Ligases/isolation & purification;Male;Molecular Weight;Organometallic Compounds/pharmacology;Reference Values;Zinc/pharmacology	Zerez CR;Wong MD;Tanaka KR	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
433	2378358	Fumarylacetoacetase measurement as a mass-screening procedure for hereditary tyrosinemia type I.	Fluorometric quantitative tyrosine determination on dried-blood spots is the primary neonatal screening test used for tyrosinemia type I (HT) in the province of Quebec. Succinylacetone determination on these same spots is used as the complementary test when the tyrosine level is higher than a given threshold. This procedure has proved to be less discriminant over the past few years because of changes in newborn feeding and because of early discharge of newborns from the nursery. We have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the deficient enzyme in HT in dried-blood spots. Fumarylacetoacetase (FAH) (E.C.3.7.1.2) was measured retrospectively by an ELISA on 25 dried-blood samples from proven patients with HT and prospectively in 72,000 specimens received in the neonatal screening program. In this pilot project, FAH was measured first, and, if necessary, succinylacetone was determined as the complementary test. All 25 samples from proven patients and specimens from four other patients detected in the pilot study have shown almost complete absence of FAH in dried-blood samples. At a cutoff level of 12.5% of normal adult blood spotted on the same type of paper, only 30 other cases disclosed FAH levels low enough to warrant succinylacetone measurement but had no detectable succinylacetone. The false-positive rate is thus 1:2,400 with this primary ELISA. However, blood transfusion in newborns prior to blood collection on filter paper may yield false-negative tests, since FAH is present in erythrocytes of normal donors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	eng	325	328	American journal of human genetics	47	2	1990	Aug		D000592/Q000175;D000592/Q000453;D000592/Q000235;D004796;D004797;D006801;D006867/Q000097;D007231;D008403;D014443/Q000097	Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/diagnosis;Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/epidemiology;Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/genetics;Clinical Enzyme Tests;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Humans;Hydrolases/blood;Infant, Newborn;Mass Screening;Tyrosine/blood	Laberge C;Grenier A;Valet JP;Morissette J	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
434	2085183	Determination of argininosuccinate lyase and arginase activities with an amino acid analyzer.	The measurement of argininosuccinate lyase (ASase) and arginase, both in liver and erythrocytes, was developed by using a commercial amino acid analyzer. The method is based upon the use of two different substrates, argininosuccinate and arginine for ASase and arginase, respectively, and the measurement of only one final metabolite: ornithine. The use of ornithine as a marker of biological activity of ASase is related to the fact that in the urea cycle, the specific activity of arginase is much higher than that of ASase; thus, during in vitro determinations, arginine, which is the product of ASase, is rapidly converted to ornithine. The sensitivity of the methods is very high since we were able to detect both activities using very diluted rat liver homogenates (0.10 mg protein/ml) or few microliters of human blood. In rat liver the Vmax for ASase and arginase were respectively 0.54 and 140 mumol/h/mg protein; the apparent Km values 1.25 and 13.5 mM. In human erythrocytes the Vmax for the same enzymes were 7.2 and 170 nmol/h/mg Hb and the apparent Km values were 0.66 and 9.5 mM. In 10 healthy volunteers the specific activity of ASase and arginase determined in blood were respectively 8.60 +/- 0.46 and 124.1 +/- 14.5 nmol/h/mg Hb. The results obtained from 2 patients suffering from argininosuccinic aciduria were also reported. In these latter cases while ASase was not detectable in blood, arginase activity was at the lowest end of the confidence limits determined in healthy volunteers.	eng	384	389	Analytical biochemistry	191	2	1990	Dec		D000596/Q000032;D000818;D001119/Q000097;D001119/Q000378;D001120/Q000378;D001123/Q000097;D001123/Q000378;D001125/Q000378;D001125/Q000652;D003241;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007231;D008099/Q000201;D008297;D008722;D009952/Q000378;D051381;D013379	Amino Acids/analysis;Animals;Arginase/blood;Arginase/metabolism;Arginine/metabolism;Argininosuccinate Lyase/blood;Argininosuccinate Lyase/metabolism;Argininosuccinic Acid/metabolism;Argininosuccinic Acid/urine;Consanguinity;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Liver/enzymology;Male;Methods;Ornithine/metabolism;Rats;Substrate Specificity	Bastone A;Diomede L;Parini R;Carnevale F;Salmona M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
435	2161459	Anionic mechanisms of zinc uptake across the human red cell membrane.	1. Zinc is taken up into human red cells by two mechanisms that depend upon the presence of anions. One of these requires bicarbonate ions, is inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS) and appears to be catalysed by the anion exchanger. The second occurs in the presence of thiocyanate or salicylate ions and may represent transport of a neutral complex with Zn2+. 2. The initial rate of Zn2+ uptake via the anion exchanger is 64 +/- 13 mumol (10(13) cells x h)-1 microM-1 external Zn2+, in the presence of 5 mM-bicarbonate at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C (+/- S.D.). This is about 1/250 of the corresponding rate of Pb2+ uptake by the anion exchanger. 3. The variation of transport with Zn2+ concentration, HCO3- concentration and pH suggests that the transported species may be ZnCO3Cl- or Zn(HCO3)Cl.OH-. 4. Zinc efflux could not be observed by either of the above routes. This observation suggests that the intracellular free Zn2+ concentration is below 3 nM.	eng	485	497	The Journal of physiology	421		1990	Feb		D017878;D012856/Q000031;D012856/Q000097;D000838/Q000097;D001639/Q000097;D002413/Q000097;D002414/Q000097;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D007854/Q000097;D012459/Q000097;D020156;D013861/Q000097;D015032/Q000097	4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid;4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/analogs & derivatives;4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/blood;Anions/blood;Bicarbonates/blood;Cations, Divalent/blood;Cations, Monovalent/blood;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Lead/blood;Salicylates/blood;Salicylic Acid;Thiocyanates/blood;Zinc/blood	Kalfakakou V;Simons TJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True
436	2297576	An isozyme of hexokinase specific for the human red blood cell (HKR).	The hexokinase (HK) of the human red blood cell (RBC) was separated into two distinct major isozymes by fast protein liquid chromatography using a linear salt gradient on a MonoQ column. The first isozyme (HKI) eluted as a sharp peak at the same position as HKI of human liver. The second isozyme eluted between HKI and HKII of human white blood cells, and it appeared to be unique to the RBC (it was designated HKR). From a gel filtration column, HKR eluted before HKI, suggesting that it was larger than HKI by several kilodaltons. In a mitochondria-enriched fraction from human reticulocytes, no HKR was found; thus, HKR was not a mitochondrial enzyme. Despite these differences in chromatographic behavior, size, and mitochondrial binding, both forms behaved kinetically as HKI. RBC from normal blood contained HKI and HKR at an equal activity, but in reticulocyte-rich RBC, HKR dominated. When RBC of increasing age was separated by buoyant density ultracentrifugation, the total HK activity decayed in a biphasic manner, with half-lives respectively of approximately 15 and approximately 51 days. When isolated by MonoQ column from each age-separated fraction, HKR was the major form in the youngest RBC, and decreased rapidly with cell age, with a t 1/2 of approximately 10 days, representing a negligible activity in the oldest RBC. Instead, HKI was relatively stable through the entire life span of the RBC, with a t 1/2 of approximately 66 days. Thus, HKR appears to be an RBC-specific isozyme that is predominant in the reticulocyte and is then rapidly degraded. During maturation of the RBC, the fast decay of HKR contributes to the early sharp decline of HK activity and the slow decay of HKI to the later gradual decline.	eng	770	775	Blood	75	3	1990	Feb	01	D000818;D002851;D004905;D004912/Q000201;D006593/Q000097;D006801;D007527/Q000097;D011817;D012156/Q000201	Animals;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Hexokinase/blood;Humans;Isoenzymes/blood;Rabbits;Reticulocytes/enzymology	Murakami K;Blei F;Tilton W;Seaman C;Piomelli S	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
437	2302397	Mobility of nucleoside transporter of human erythrocytes differs greatly when loaded with different nucleosides.	Time courses of transmembrane equilibration of 2-chloroadenosine, 2'-deoxyadenosine, 3'-deoxyadenosine, cytidine and 2'-deoxycytidine were measured by rapid kinetic techniques in human erythrocytes under equilibrium exchange and zero-trans conditions. The kinetic parameters for transport were computed by fitting appropriate integrated rate equations to the data pooled for seven concentrations and compared to the kinetic parameters for uridine, adenosine, thymidine and formycin B transport determined previously for human erythrocytes under comparable experimental conditions. The transport of all nucleosides conformed to the simple carrier model and was directionally symmetric. The Michaelis-Menten constants for equilibrium exchange (Kee) ranged from 22 microM for 2-chloroadenosine to about 4 mM for cytidine and the maximum velocities (Vee) differed in a similar manner, so that the first-order rate constants (Vee/Kee) were similar for all nucleosides. The kinetic parameters for 2'-deoxyadenosine transport were similar to those for adenosine transport, whereas the lack of the 3'-OH group greatly reduced the affinity of 3'-deoxyadenosine (cordycepin) for the carrier. 2', 3'-Dideoxynucleosides were transported less than 1% as efficiently as 2'- and 3'-deoxynucleosides. Thus, the 2'- and 3'-OH groups play an important role in nucleoside transport. The mobility of the carrier when loaded with pyrimidine nucleosides (reflected by Vee) was 5-10-times greater than that of the empty carrier, whereas the mobility of the adenosine-loaded or 2'-deoxyadenosine-loaded carrier was about equal to that of the empty carrier. Loading the carrier with 2-chloroadenosine or 3'-deoxyadenosine actually decreased its mobility. Thus, the differential mobility of the loaded and empty carrier differs greatly with the nucleoside substrate. The mobility of the loaded carrier as well as Kee increased with a decrease in lipid solubility of the nucleoside substrate, but the relationship was complex.	eng	103	109	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1022	1	1990	Feb	16	D015762/Q000378;D003562/Q000378;D003839/Q000378;D003841/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D009705/Q000378;D013379	2-Chloroadenosine/metabolism;Cytidine/metabolism;Deoxyadenosines/metabolism;Deoxycytidine/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Nucleosides/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Plagemann PG;Aran JM;Wohlhueter RM;Woffendin C	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
438	2107103	Identification in human erythrocytes of mono(ADP-ribosyl) protein hydrolase that cleaves a mono(ADP-ribosyl) Gi linkage.	A novel enzymatic activity, the hydrolysis of linkages between mono(ADP-ribose) and cysteine residues in Gi prepared by eukaryotic ADP-ribosyltransferase C [(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 5485-5489] was found in the cytosol of human erythrocytes. The mono(ADP-ribosyl) Gi hydrolase, tentatively named ADP-ribosyl protein hydrolase C was partially purified by sequential chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose and Blue Sepharose. This enzyme catalyzes the release of ADP-ribose from mono(ADP-ribosyl) Gi. Its activity was enhanced by Ca2+ and inhibited by ADP-ribose. The presence of this enzyme in eukaryotic cells suggests that endogenous mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Gi is a reversible post-translational modification.	eng	381	384	FEBS letters	261	2	1990	Feb	26	D000246/Q000097;D000246/Q000494;D001665;D002851;D004912/Q000201;D019204/Q000097;D006801;D006867/Q000037;D006867/Q000097;D006868;D007700	Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/blood;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/pharmacology;Binding Sites;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/enzymology;GTP-Binding Proteins/blood;Humans;Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors;Hydrolases/blood;Hydrolysis;Kinetics	Tanuma S;Endo H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

441	2379504	Purification and characterization of an (ADP-ribose)n glycohydrolase from human erythrocytes.	An (ADP-ribose)n glycohydrolase from human erythrocytes was purified approximately 13,000-fold and characterized. On sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel the purified enzyme appeared homogeneous and had an estimated relative molecular mass (Mr) of 59,000. Amino acid analysis showed that the enzyme had a relatively high content of acidic amino acid residues and low content of basic amino acid residues. Isoelectrofocusing showed that the enzyme was an acidic protein with pI value of 5.9. The mode of hydrolysis of (ADP-ribose)n by this enzyme was exoglycosidic, yielding ADP-ribose as the final product. The Km value for (ADP-ribose)n (average chain length, n = 15) was 5.8 microM and the maximal velocity of its hydrolysis was 21 mumol.min-1.mg protein-1. The optimum pH for enzyme activity was 7.4 KCl was more inhibitory than NaCl. The enzyme activity was inhibited by ADP-ribose and cAMP but not the dibutyryl-derivative (Bt2-cAMP), cGMP or AMP. These physical and catalytic properties are similar to those of cytosolic (ADP-ribose)n glycohydrolase II, but not to those of nuclear (ADP-ribose)n glycohydrolase I purified from guinea pig liver [Tanuma, S., Kawashima, K. & Endo, H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 965-969]. Thus, human erythrocytes contain (ADP-ribose)n glycohydrolase II. The kinetics of degradation of poly(ADP-ribose) bound to histone H1 by purified erythrocyte (ADP-ribose)n glycohydrolase was essentially the same as that of the corresponding free poly(ADP-ribose). In contrast, the glycohydrolase showed appreciable activity of free oligo(ADP-ribose), much less activity on the corresponding oligo(ADP-ribose) bound to histone H1. The enzyme had more activity on oligo(ADP-ribose) bound to mitochondrial and cytosolic free mRNA ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) proteins than on oligo(ADP-ribose) bound to histone H1. It did not degrade mono(ADP-ribosyl)-stimulatory guanine-nucleotide-binding protein (Gs) and -inhibitory guanine-nucleotide-binding protein (Gi) prepared with cholera and pertussis toxins, respectively. These results suggest that cytosolic (ADP-ribose)n glycohydrolase II may be involved in extranuclear de(ADP-ribosyl)n-ation, but not in membrane de-mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation.	eng	57	63	European journal of biochemistry	191	1	1990	Jul	20	D000246/Q000378;D000596/Q000032;D000818;D002417;D002855;D004591;D004912/Q000201;D006026/Q000037;D006026/Q000302;D006026/Q000378;D006168;D006657/Q000378;D006801;D008930/Q000201;D009711;D011189;D014176;D013379	Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Amino Acids/analysis;Animals;Cattle;Chromatography, Thin Layer;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glycoside Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors;Glycoside Hydrolases/isolation & purification;Glycoside Hydrolases/metabolism;Guinea Pigs;Histones/metabolism;Humans;Mitochondria, Liver/enzymology;Nucleotides;Potassium Chloride;Protein Biosynthesis;Substrate Specificity	Tanuma S;Endo H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
442	2363688	Decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen III by erythrocyte uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. Evidence for a random decarboxylation mechanism.	The isomeric composition of type-III heptacarboxylic porphyrinogens derived from decarbosylation of uroporphyrinogen III by erythrocyte uroporphyringogen decarboxylase was analysed by h.p.l.c. with electrochemical detection. All four possible isomers were identified, and there were little differences in the proportion of isomers formed by erythrocytes from normal subjects and from patients with sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda. The results provide conclusive evidence that the normal decarboxylation pathway is random in nature, and the fourth isomer only increases when enzyme abnormality is found.	eng	513	515	The Biochemical journal	268	2	1990	Jun	01	D002262/Q000378;D003653;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007536;D011165/Q000378;D014575/Q000378;D014577/Q000378	Carboxy-Lyases/metabolism;Decarboxylation;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Isomerism;Porphyrinogens/metabolism;Uroporphyrinogen Decarboxylase/metabolism;Uroporphyrinogens/metabolism	Luo J;Lim CK	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
443	2123099	cDNA cloning of a 30 kDa erythrocyte membrane protein associated with Rh (Rhesus)-blood-group-antigen expression.	The Rh-blood-group antigens (often described as Rhesus antigens) are associated with erythrocyte membrane proteins of approx. 30 kDa. We have determined the N-terminal 54 amino acid residues of the 30 kDa Rh D polypeptide (D30 polypeptide). We used primers based on these sequence data and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on human reticulocyte cDNA and genomic DNA to clone two types of PCR product of identical size. The two PCR products had related translated amino acid sequences between the 3' ends of the primers, one of which was identical with that found for the D30 polypeptide. We designate the two related mRNA species which gave rise to the PCR products as Rh30A and Rh30B, the latter corresponding to the D30 polypeptide. We have isolated cDNA clones for the Rh30A protein which encode a hydrophobic membrane protein of 417 amino acids. The Rh30A protein has the same N-terminal 41 amino acids as the D30 polypeptide, but beyond this point the sequence differs, but is clearly related. The Rh30A protein probably corresponds to the R6A32 polypeptide, another member of the Rh 30 kDa family of proteins, which may carry the C/c and/or E/e antigens. Hydropathy analysis suggests that the Rh30A protein has up to 12 transmembrane domains. Three of these domains are bordered by a novel cysteine-containing motif, which might signal substitutions at these cysteine residues.

444	2146924	Importance of nicotinamide as an NAD precursor in the human erythrocyte.	The effect of variation in the concentration of inorganic phosphate and of the pyridine precursors nicotinamide (NAm) and nicotinic acid (NA) on pyridine nucleotide synthesis was studied using intact human erythrocytes. A wide range of incubation times was employed. The results showed that under physiological conditions the rate of synthesis of NAD from NAm exceeded that from NA twofold, while the reverse situation pertained at higher and unphysiological substrate levels. The two pathways had different regulation points. For NAm the rate-limiting factor was the initial step, namely its conversion into the mononucleotide, while for NA it lay at the second step, conversion of NA mononucleotide (NAMN) to its adenine dinucleotide. At physiological substrate levels the uptake of NA and conversion to NAMN were rapid, while the uptake and conversion of NAm were time dependent. This process was stimulated significantly by inorganic phosphate only for NAm. These results indicate that while NA is the predominant precursor of human erythrocyte NAD at high (unphysiological) substrate and phosphate levels, NAm is more efficient as an NAD precursor under physiological conditions, suggesting an important and hitherto unrecognized role for nicotinamide in NAD synthesis in vivo.	eng	40	45	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics	283	1	1990	Nov	15	D000244/Q000097;D000244/Q000302;D000249/Q000097;D000249/Q000302;D000255/Q000097;D000255/Q000302;D000328;D002851;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007291/Q000097;D007291/Q000302;D008954;D009243/Q000096;D009243/Q000097;D009243/Q000302;D009525/Q000097;D009536/Q000097;D012016	Adenosine Diphosphate/blood;Adenosine Diphosphate/isolation & purification;Adenosine Monophosphate/blood;Adenosine Monophosphate/isolation & purification;Adenosine Triphosphate/blood;Adenosine Triphosphate/isolation & purification;Adult;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Inosine Monophosphate/blood;Inosine Monophosphate/isolation & purification;Models, Biological;NAD/biosynthesis;NAD/blood;NAD/isolation & purification;Niacin/blood;Niacinamide/blood;Reference Values	Micheli V;Simmonds HA;Sestini S;Ricci C	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
445	2174037	A novel antioxidant role for hemoglobin. The comproportionation of ferrylhemoglobin with oxyhemoglobin.	Ferrylhemoglobin (X-FeIV-OH, where X denotes an amino acid residue in the globin moiety) has long been suspected as a cytotoxic agent produced by the interaction of oxyhemoglobin (X-FeIIO2) or methemoglobin (X-FeIII) with H2O2 in red blood cells. To date, however, technical difficulties have prevented the identification and quantification of X-FeIV-OH. Oxyhemoglobin exposed to a continuous flux of H2O2 (generated at a rate of 120 microM/min during the glucose oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of glucose) was oxidized to (a) X-FeIV-OH when [X-FeIIO2] less than 75 microM and (b) X-FeIII when [X-FeIIO2] greater than 75 microM (the production of X-FeIII proceeded with intermediate formation of X-FeIV-OH). The reduction of the X-FeIV-OH to X-FeIII could be explained by either of two alternative mechanisms: a O2(-)-mediated X-FeIV-OH---X-FeIII transition or a comproportionation of X-FeIV-OH and X-FeIIO2 to yield X-FeIII (a process mediated by a tyrosine moiety in the hemoprotein). The low rate of X-FeIIO2 autoxidation plus the negligible decrease in the rate of X-FeIII formation in the presence of either native or heat-denatured superoxide dismutase or apoenzyme (1 microM) suggested that O2- does not contribute to the reduction of X-FeIV-OH. Moreover, the dependence of X-FeIII formation on X-FeIIO2 concentration, together with the results of O2 uptake and H2O2 consumption measurements, provide experimental evidence to support the comproportionation reaction. Comproportionation is apparently catalyzed by intermolecular electron transfer between tyrosine residues, since the reaction did not occur when tyrosine residues were blocked by acetylation. Intact red blood cells exposed to the same flow rate of H2O2 presented a spectral profile which could be explained as a transition from X-FeIIO2 to X-FeIII. The intermediate production of X-FeIV-OH was detected by adding Na2S (2 mM), which revealed a spectral profile identical with that obtained with purified X-FeIV-OH. Measurements of concentrations and relative rate constants for the reaction of various intracellular reductants (glutathione, NAD(P)H, uric acid, ascorbic acid) with X-FeIV-OH revealed that comproportionation of X-FeIV-OH with X-FeIIO2 is the favored reaction. Our results provide (to our knowledge) the first definitive evidence for X-FeIV-OH in intact red blood cells. The rapid comproportionation reaction between X-FeIV-OH and X-FeIIO2 (to produce X-FeIII) explains why X-FeIV-OH has been elusive to date.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	eng	19453	19460	The Journal of biological chemistry	265	32	1990	Nov	15	D000107;D000818;D000975;D002417;D005947/Q000378;D005949/Q000378;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D006861/Q000378;D010084;D010100/Q000378;D010108/Q000378;D013053;D013482/Q000494;D013481/Q000378;D014443/Q000378	Acetylation;Animals;Antioxidants;Cattle;Glucose/metabolism;Glucose Oxidase/metabolism;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxygen/metabolism;Oxyhemoglobins/metabolism;Spectrophotometry;Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacology;Superoxides/metabolism;Tyrosine/metabolism	Giulivi C;Davies KJ	Journal, Articles							red blood cell	True
446	2085314	Mannose-6-phosphate isomerase polymorphism in baboon erythrocytes.	Although erythrocytic mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (MPI) has been reported to be undetectable in mammals, we have demonstrated that sufficient activity is present in some species to enable its electrophoretic analysis. A survey of MPI from 2656 baboons revealed four allelic isozymes which segregated codominantly in pedigreed families. The gene frequencies differed significantly among five subspecies of baboons. However, the MPI*C allele had the highest frequency in all subspecies, ranging from 0.830 to 1.000. MPI phenotypes from erythrocytes and liver of the same individual were identical, indicating that the erythrocytic enzyme is specified by the same gene locus as the liver enzyme.	eng	495	501	Biochemical genetics	28	9-10	1990	Oct		D000818;D004912/Q000201;D005787;D007527/Q000097;D007527/Q000235;D008099/Q000201;D008359/Q000097;D008359/Q000235;D010215/Q000097;D010215/Q000145;D010215/Q000235;D010641;D011110;D013045	Animals;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Gene Frequency;Isoenzymes/blood;Isoenzymes/genetics;Liver/enzymology;Mannose-6-Phosphate Isomerase/blood;Mannose-6-Phosphate Isomerase/genetics;Papio/blood;Papio/classification;Papio/genetics;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Genetic;Species Specificity	VandeBerg JL;Aivaliotis MJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
447	2283678	Thiamin transport by human erythrocytes and ghosts.	Thiamin transport in human erythrocytes and resealed pink ghosts was evaluated by incubating both preparations at 37 or 20 degrees C in the presence of [3H]-thiamin of high specific activity. The rate of uptake was consistently higher in erythrocytes than in ghosts. In both preparations, the time course of uptake was independent from the presence of Na+ and did not reach equilibrium after 60 min incubation. At concentrations below 0.5 microM and at 37 degrees C, thiamin was taken up predominantly by a saturable mechanism in both erythrocytes and ghosts. Apparent kinetic constants were: for erythrocytes, Km = 0.12, 0.11 and 0.10 microM and Jmax = 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 pmol.microliter-1 intracellular water after 3, 15, and 30 min incubation times, respectively; for ghosts, Km = 0.16 and 0.51 microM and Jmax = 0.01 and 0.04 pmol.microliter-1 intracellular water after 15 and 30 min incubation times, respectively. At 20 degrees C, the saturable component disappeared in both preparations. Erythrocyte thiamin transport was not influenced by the presence of D-glucose or metabolic inhibitors. In both preparations, thiamin transport was inhibited competitively by unlabeled thiamin, pyrithiamin, amprolium and, to a lesser extent, oxythiamin, the inhibiting effect being always more marked in erythrocytes than in ghosts. Only approximately 20% of the thiamin taken up by erythrocytes was protein- (probably membrane-) bound. A similar proportion was esterified to thiamin pyrophosphate. Separate experiments using valinomycin and SCN- showed that the transport of thiamin, which is a cation at pH 7.4, is unaffected by changes in membrane potential in both preparations.	eng	11	18	The Journal of membrane biology	118	1	1990	Oct		D001692;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008564;D011485;D013696;D013831/Q000097;D013831/Q000378	Biological Transport;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Membrane Potentials;Protein Binding;Temperature;Thiamine/blood;Thiamine/metabolism	Casirola D;Patrini C;Ferrari G;Rindi G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
448	2170402	The human erythrocyte contains two forms of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase which are differentially active toward membranes.	A human erythrocyte cytosolic phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP kinase) and a membrane-bound PIP kinase have been purified by phosphocellulose chromatography. Fractionation of the membrane-bound PIP kinase activities by phosphocellulose separated activity into two peaks, which eluted at 0.6 M NaCl (type I PIP kinase) and 1.0 M NaCl (type II PIP kinase). The cytosolic PIP kinase and the membrane-bound type II PIP kinase are 53 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, have indistinguishable 125I-peptide maps, and are immunochemically indistinguishable, suggesting that they are sequence identical. Antibodies raised to the cytosolic PIP kinase inhibit activity of both the membrane-bound type II and the cytosolic PIP kinases. The type I PIP kinase appears to be distinct from the cytosolic and membrane-bound type II PIP kinase; it is not immunocross-reactive, and antibodies toward type II PIP kinases do not inhibit type I PIP kinase. Further, membrane-bound type II PIP kinase can be removed from type I PIP kinase without loss of activity. Functional characterization of the PIP kinases demonstrates that the type I kinase has a 10-fold lower Km for PIP and a 5-fold higher Km for ATP compared with the type II enzymes. The type I and type II (membrane-bound or cytosolic) PIP kinases are modulated differentially by spermine and heparin. Finally, the type I PIP kinase phosphorylates intrinsic PIP on isolated erythrocyte membranes, whereas the type II PIP kinases have no activity toward native membranes.	eng	18012	18022	The Journal of biological chemistry	265	29	1990	Oct	15	D002852;D003600/Q000201;D004591;D004910/Q000201;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008081;D008563/Q000097;D008970;D018129;D010716/Q000097;D010770/Q000097;D010770/Q000302;D017853;D013379	Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Cytosol/enzymology;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Liposomes;Membrane Lipids/blood;Molecular Weight;Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates;Phosphatidylinositols/blood;Phosphotransferases/blood;Phosphotransferases/isolation & purification;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor);Substrate Specificity	Bazenet CE;Ruano AR;Brockman JL;Anderson RA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
449	2168394	Mechanism-based inactivation of leukotriene A4 hydrolase during leukotriene B4 formation by human erythrocytes.	"Evidence is presented in support of a mechanism-based (suicide) inactivation of leukotriene A4 hydrolyase in intact human erythrocytes by leukotriene A4 and leukotriene A4 methyl ester. Loss of enzymatic activity, accompanying leukotriene B4 formation, was proportional to the substrate concentration. Inactivation was directly related to the amount of leukotriene B4 formation: for several, different experimental protocols 50% loss of hydrolase activity corresponded with formation of 10.3 +/- 2.1 microM leukotriene B4. The time course of inactivation was pseudo-first order and obeyed saturation kinetics. Apparent inactivation (KI) and first-order rate (ki) constants for leukotriene A4 were 28 microM and 0.35 min-1, respectively. Leukotriene A4 methyl ester was also a site-directed inactivator with a similar KI = 25 microM and a ki = 0.1 min-1. For single incubations substrate instability limited the extent of inactivation to 50% of the initial enzyme activity. Following multiple, consecutive incubations with leukotriene A4 this increased and approached 80-90%; however, a residual activity of 10-20% suggested that a pool of enzyme was not susceptible to inactivation. Recovery of enzymatic activity, following inactivation, was negligible in intact erythrocytes and isolated enzyme. A single radiolabeled protein, corresponding to leukotriene A4 hydrolase, was detected by electrophoretic analysis of the incubation between [3H]leukotriene A4 and erythrocytes, or partially purified enzyme. Incorporation of [3H]leukotriene A4 methyl ester into enzyme was linearly related to its inactivation: 191 +/- 5 pmol incorporated corresponded to 10% loss of activity. Results conform to criteria for a mechanism-based inactivation, in which leukotriene A4 participates in two parallel processes, one leading to leukotriene B4 formation, the other to ""suicide"" inactivation of leukotriene A4 hydrolase in intact erythrocytes. The specific, rather than indiscriminate nature of this process has implications for the regulation of cellular leukotriene B4 formation. It may also afford a basis to monitor transcellular biosynthesis of leukotriene B4 in vivo."	eng	14911	14916	The Journal of biological chemistry	265	25	1990	Sep	05	D004851/Q000037;D004851/Q000097;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D007700;D017572;D007975/Q000096;D007975/Q000097;D015289/Q000097;D015289/Q000494;D013997	Epoxide Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors;Epoxide Hydrolases/blood;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Leukotriene A4;Leukotriene B4/biosynthesis;Leukotriene B4/blood;Leukotrienes/blood;Leukotrienes/pharmacology;Time Factors	Orning L;Jones DA;Fitzpatrick FA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
450	1677198	A salt-activated inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 3-phosphatase at the inner surface of the human erythrocyte membrane.	The localization of the human erythrocyte membrane Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 3-phosphatase was investigated by saponin permeabilization of resealed 'isoionic' erythrocyte ghosts. This enzyme is active at the inner face of the plasma membrane, at the same site as a specific 5-phosphatase that degrades both Ins (1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. In the presence of EDTA, Ins(1,4,5)P3 was the only product of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 metabolism. However, when Mg2+ was present both the 5-phosphatase and the 3-phosphatase attacked Ins (1,3,4,5)P4, directly forming Ins(1,3,4)P3 and Ins(1,4,5)P3;some Ins(1,4)P2 was also formed as a product of 5-phosphatase attack on the liberated Ins(1,4,5)P3. The Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 3-phosphatase was potently activated by KCl, thus making the route of metabolism of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 by erythrocyte ghosts strikingly sensitive to variations in ionic strength: at 'cytosolic' K+ and Mg2+ levels, 3-phosphatase activity slightly predominated over 5-phosphatase. Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 3-phosphatase was potently inhibited by Ins-(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 at levels lower than those often observed within cells. This leaves open the question as to whether the cellular function of inositol polyphosphate 3-phosphatase is to participate in a physiological cycle that interconverts Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and Ins(1,4,5)P3 or to metabolize other inositol polyphosphates in the cytosol compartment of cells.	eng	63	68	Proceedings.

451	2070838	Identification of two molecular chaperons (HSX70, HSC70) in mature human erythrocytes.	Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of cytosolic proteins from mature human erythrocytes combined with immunoblotting revealed the presence of a group of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that included two molecular chaperons of the HSP70 family (HSX70, inducible; HSC70, constitutively expressed) and HSP90. As expected for cells devoid of organelles, erythrocytes do not contain stress proteins that are localized either in the mitochondria (HSP60, glucose-regulated protein (GRP 75) or in the endoplasmic reticulum (GRP78 or Ig heavy chain-binding protein, endoplasmin). Since red cells are unable to replace proteins whose structure has been damaged by environmental changes the results are taken to imply a role for chaperons in monitoring, protecting, and maintaining the structure and stability of erythrocyte proteins.	eng	556	559	Experimental cell research	195	2	1991	Aug		D015180;D000091342;D004912/Q000737;D006360/Q000032;D006801;D015151	Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional;Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Heat-Shock Proteins/analysis;Humans;Immunoblotting	Gromov PS;Celis JE	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
452	1652438	Purification and characterization of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase from human erythrocyte membranes.	Two species of PtdIns 4-kinase with molecular masses of 50 kDa and 45 kDa were detected in human erythrocyte membranes using SDS/PAGE. These enzymes were purified to near homogeneity and found to display very similar enzymatic characteristics. The purification scheme consisted of solubilization from erythrocyte membranes in the presence of Triton X-100, followed by Cibacron-blue-Sephadex, phosphocellulose and Mono Q anion-exchange chromatography. The final step in the purification protocol was preparative SDS/PAGE, followed by electroelution and renaturation of the enzyme. This procedure afforded an about 4000-fold purification of the enzyme from erythrocyte membranes. Characterization of the [32P]PtdInsP products formed by the purified PtdIns kinases indicated that these enzymes specifically phosphorylated the D-4 position of the inositol ring. The Km values of both PtdIns 4-kinase species for PtdIns and ATP were found to be 0.2 mM and 0.1 mM, respectively. The enzymes are both activated by Mg2+, and inhibited by Ca2+ and by adenosine. The potential importance of these effectors for the regulation of PtdIns phosphorylation in cells is discussed.	eng	179	185	European journal of biochemistry	200	1	1991	Aug	15	D019870;D002852;D004591;D004789;D004791;D004795;D004910/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D010766;D010770/Q000737;D010770/Q000302;D013379	1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Enzyme Activation;Enzyme Inhibitors;Enzyme Stability;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases/chemistry;Phosphotransferases/isolation & purification;Substrate Specificity	Wetzker R;Klinger R;Hsuan J;Fry MJ;Kauffmann-Zeh A;Müller E;Frunder H;Waterfield M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
453	1986373	Molecular cloning, sequence, and tissue distribution of the human ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1.	The ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 catalyzes the first step in ubiquitin conjugation. We have cloned and sequenced the cDNA for human E1. This clone predicts a protein of 110,450 Da. Cys-194 lies within a region of identity to active-site Cys-88 of the ubiquitin carrier protein E2, suggesting a potential role for this region in enzymatic function of this protein. In addition, Cys-454 lies within a region of identity to the thiol ester consensus sequence of several proteins involved in thioester formation. Tissue distribution reveals a single 3.5-kilobase E1 message ubiquitous among tissues and cell lines.	eng	258	262	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	88	1	1991	Jan	01	D000595;D000906/Q000302;D001483;D003001;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D015723;D006801;D008025/Q000097;D008025/Q000235;D008025/Q000302;D008969;D009928;D010920/Q000201;D011247;D014176;D014158;D044764;D044767	Amino Acid Sequence;Antibodies/isolation & purification;Base Sequence;Cloning, Molecular;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Gene Library;Humans;Ligases/blood;Ligases/genetics;Ligases/isolation & purification;Molecular Sequence Data;Organ Specificity;Placenta/enzymology;Pregnancy;Protein Biosynthesis;Transcription, Genetic;Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes;Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases	Handley PM;Mueckler M;Siegel NR;Ciechanover A;Schwartz AL	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte	True
454	1663743	Hydrolysis by acylphosphatase of erythrocyte membrane Na+, K(+)-ATPase phosphorylated intermediate.	Acylphosphatase, purified from human erythrocytes, actively hydrolyzes the phosphoenzyme intermediate of human red blood cell membrane Na+, K(+)-ATPase. This effect occurred with acylphosphatase amounts (up to 10 units/mg membrane protein) that fall within the physiological range. Acylphosphatase addition to erythrocyte membranes resulted in a significant increase in the rate of Na+, K(+)-dependent ATP hydrolysis. Maximal stimulation, observed with 10 units/mg membrane protein, was of about 80% over basal value. The same acylphosphatase amount enhanced of about 40% the rate of ATP driven Na+ transport into inside out red cell membrane vesicles. Taken together these findings suggest a potential role of acylphosphatase in the control of the activity of erythrocyte membrane Na,K pump.	eng	959	968	Biochemistry international	24	5	1991	Jul		D017766;D001345;D001693;D004910/Q000201;D006868;D010744/Q000378;D010766;D011188/Q000378;D012964/Q000378;D000254/Q000378;D000097024	Acid Anhydride Hydrolases;Autoradiography;Biological Transport, Active;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Hydrolysis;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism;Phosphorylation;Potassium/metabolism;Sodium/metabolism;Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/metabolism;Acylphosphatase	Nediani C;Marchetti E;Nassi P;Liguri G;Ramponi G	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
455	2043160	Irreversible inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase in Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes: growth inhibition in vitro.	Blocking spermidine and spermine synthesis in Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes with irreversible inhibitors of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMet DC; EC 4.1.1.50), prevented the growth of the parasite in vitro. The most potent of these compounds, MDL 73811, inhibited growth of chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant strains of P. falciparum equally, with an IC50 of 2-3 microM. Other structurally related compounds also inhibited parasite proliferation, but to a lesser degree, determined apparently by their potency for inhibition of AdoMet DC. The growth inhibition by MDL 73811 could be alleviated by incubating infected erythrocytes with spermidine and spermine, but not putrescine. Parasites treated with the drug were arrested at the trophozoite stage of the erythrocytic cycle and had putrescine levels which were elevated by about 3- to 4-fold. Treatment of crude extracts of purified parasites with 1 microM MDL 73811 inhibited AdoMet DC activity by greater than 90%. These biochemical changes in P. falciparum-infected cells were consistent with AdoMet DC inhibition being the primary effect of MDL 73811 treatment.	eng	1713	1718	Biochemical pharmacology	41	11	1991	Jun	01	D012437/Q000037;D000818;D002478;D002738/Q000494;D003839/Q000494;D000518/Q000494;D004912/Q000469;D006801;D010963/Q000187;D010963/Q000201;D010963/Q000254;D011073/Q000032;D013095/Q000494;D013096/Q000494	Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors;Animals;Cells, Cultured;Chloroquine/pharmacology;Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology;Eflornithine/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Humans;Plasmodium falciparum/drug effects;Plasmodium falciparum/enzymology;Plasmodium falciparum/growth & development;Polyamines/analysis;Spermidine/pharmacology;Spermine/pharmacology	Wright PS;Byers TL;Cross-Doersen DE;McCann PP;Bitonti AJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
456	1645713	Effects of acylphosphatase on the activity of erythrocyte membrane Ca2+ pump.	Acylphosphatase, purified from human erythrocytes, actively hydrolyzes the acylphosphorylated intermediate of human red blood cell membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase. This effect occurred with acylphosphatase amounts (up to 10 units/mg membrane protein) that fall within the physiological range. Furthermore, a very low Km value, 3.41 +/- 1.16 (S.E.) nM, suggests a high affinity in acylphosphatase for the phosphoenzyme intermediate, which is consistent with the small number of Ca(2+)-ATPase units in human erythrocyte membrane. Acylphosphatase addition to red cell membranes resulted in a significant increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Maximal stimulation (about 2-fold over basal) was obtained at 2 units/mg membrane protein, with a concomitant decrease in apparent Km values for both Ca2+ and ATP. Conversely, similar amounts of acylphosphatase significantly decreased (by about 30%) the rate of Ca2+ transport into inside-out red cell membrane vesicles, albeit that reduced apparent Km values for Ca2+ and ATP were also observed in this case. A stoichiometry of 2.04 Ca2+/ATP hydrolyzed was calculated in the absence of acylphosphatase; in the presence of acylphosphatase optimal concentration, this ratio was reduced to 0.9. Acylphosphatase activity, rather than just protein, was essential for all the above effects. Taken together these findings suggest that, because of its hydrolytic activity on the phosphoenzyme intermediate, acylphosphatase reduces the efficiency of the erythrocyte membrane Ca2+ pump. A possible mechanism for this effect is that the phosphoenzyme is hydrolyzed before its transport work can be accomplished.	eng	10867	10871	The Journal of biological chemistry	266	17	1991	Jun	15	D017766;D001693;D002118/Q000097;D000252/Q000097;D000252/Q000302;D004910/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D010744/Q000097;D010744/Q000494;D000097024	Acid Anhydride Hydrolases;Biological Transport, Active;Calcium/blood;Calcium-Transporting ATPases/blood;Calcium-Transporting ATPases/isolation & purification;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/blood;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/pharmacology;Acylphosphatase	Nassi P;Nediani C;Liguri G;Taddei N;Ramponi G	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
457	1829380	Thioltransferase in human red blood cells: purification and properties.	Thioltransferase activity was identified and the enzyme purified to apparent homogeneity from human red blood cells. Activity was measured as glutathione-dependent reduction of the prototype substrate hydroxyethyl disulfide; formation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was coupled to NADPH oxidation by GSSG reductase (1 unit of activity = 1 mumol/min of NADPH oxidized). The thioltransferase-GSH-GSSG reductase system was shown also to catalyze the regeneration of hemoglobin from the mixed disulfide hemoglobin-S-S-glutathione (HbSSG) and to reactivate the metabolic control enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK) after oxidation of its sulfhydryl groups. On a relative concentration basis, thioltransferase was about 1200 times more efficient than dithiothreitol in reactivation of phosphofructokinase; e.g., 500 microM DTT was required to effect the same extent of reactivation as that of 0.4 microM TTase. The GSH plus GSSG reductase system without thioltransferase was ineffective for reduction of HbSSG or reactivation of PFK. The average amount of thioltransferase in intact erythrocytes was calculated to be 4.6 units/g of Hb at 25 degrees C. This level of activity is about the same as those of other enzymes that participate in sulfhydryl maintenance in red blood cells, such as GSSG reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. These results suggest a physiological role for the thioltransferase in erythrocyte sulfhydryl homeostasis. Certain properties of the human erythrocyte thioltransferase resemble those of other mammalian thioltransferase and glutaredoxin enzymes. Thus, the human erythrocyte enzyme, purified about 28,000-fold to apparent homogeneity, is a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 11,300. Its N-terminus is blocked, it is heat stable, and it contains four cysteine residues per protein molecule. However, the human erythrocyte thioltransferase is a distinct protein based on its amino acid composition. For example, it contains no methionine residues; whereas the related mammalian enzymes described to date have at least one internal methionine residue in their largely homologous sequences.	eng	6088	6097	Biochemistry	30	25	1991	Jun	25	D000596/Q000737;D002845;D004789/Q000187;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D005954/Q000378;D054477;D005978/Q000031;D005978/Q000494;D019803;D005980/Q000378;D006706;D006801;D008970;D009249/Q000378;D010084;D010088/Q000097;D010088/Q000737;D010088/Q000302;D010732/Q000378;D011490	Amino Acids/chemistry;Chromatography;Enzyme Activation/drug effects;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/metabolism;Glutaredoxins;Glutathione/analogs & derivatives;Glutathione/pharmacology;Glutathione Disulfide;Glutathione Reductase/metabolism;Homeostasis;Humans;Molecular Weight;NADP/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidoreductases/blood;Oxidoreductases/chemistry;Oxidoreductases/isolation & purification;Phosphofructokinase-1/metabolism;Protein Disulfide Reductase (Glutathione)	Mieyal JJ;Starke DW;Gravina SA;Dothey C;Chung JS	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
458	2039446	Carnitine palmitoyltransferase in human erythrocyte membrane. Properties and malonyl-CoA sensitivity.	Carnitine palmitoyltransferase located in the erythrocyte plasma membrane is sensitive to inhibition by malonyl-CoA and 2-bromopalmitoyl-CoA plus carnitine. Although this inhibition and other properties suggest similarities to the intracellular enzymes in other tissues, no cross-reaction was observed with antisera to the peroxisomal or to the mitochondrial inner-membrane enzyme. The activity was solubilized by and was stable in Triton X-100, which destroys the enzymes found in microsomes and in the mitochondrial outer membrane. The substrate specificity is broader than for the intracellular enzymes, the activities with stearoyl-CoA (114%) and arachidonoyl-CoA (97%) being equal to that with palmitoyl-CoA, and the activities with linoleoyl-CoA (44%) and erucoyl-CoA (46%) about half that with palmitoyl-CoA. The function of this carnitine palmitoyltransferase is probably to buffer the acyl-CoA present in the erythrocyte for turnover of the fatty acyl groups of the membrane lipids.	eng	685	688	The Biochemical journal	275 ( Pt 3)	Pt 3	1991	May	01	D000818;D002334/Q000037;D002334/Q000097;D002417;D004795;D004910/Q000201;D006801;D007425/Q000201;D008316/Q000494;D008830/Q000201;D008928/Q000201;D017830;D011092;D012995;D013379	Animals;Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors;Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase/blood;Cattle;Enzyme Stability;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Humans;Intracellular Membranes/enzymology;Malonyl Coenzyme A/pharmacology;Microbodies/enzymology;Mitochondria/enzymology;Octoxynol;Polyethylene Glycols;Solubility;Substrate Specificity	Ramsay RR;Mancinelli G;Arduini A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
459	2036445	Palmitate binding to and efflux kinetics from human erythrocyte ghost.	At 0 degrees C, pH 7.3, palmitate (PA) binds to human erythrocyte ghosts suspended in 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution with molar ratios of PA to BSA, v, between 0.2 and 1.3. The binding depends on the water phase PA concentration, measured in equilibrium experiments, using BSA-filled ghosts as semipermeable bags. The saturable binding has a capacity of 19.4 +/- 7.5 nmol g-1 packed ghosts (7.2 x 10(9) cells) and Kd = 13.5 +/- 5 nM. PA exchange efflux kinetics to 0.2% BSA is recorded from ghosts without and with 0.2% BSA with a resolution time of about 1 s. Data are analyzed in terms of compartmental models. Using BSA-free ghosts the kinetics is essentially monoexponential. The rate constant is 0.0287 +/- 0.0022 s-1. Using ghosts with BSA, the kinetics is biexponential with widely different rate constants. Extrapolated zero-time values reflect, according to additional investigations, 'instantaneous' release of PA from the outer surface of the ghosts. Analyses of the biexponential curve up to about 55% tracer efflux assign unequivocally values to three model parameters. (1) k1, the dissociation rate constant of the PA-BSA complex is (1.47 +/- 0.03) x 10(-3) s-1 and (2.56 +/- 0.08) x 10(-3) s-1 and (4.08 +/- 0.13) x 10(-3) s-1 at v = 0.2, 0.6 and 1.4, respectively. (2) k3*, the overall rate constant of PA transport from the inside of the ghost membrane to the medium is 0.0269 +/- 0.0020 s-1 independent of v. (3) Qkin, the ratio of PA on the inside of the membrane to PA on BSA within the ghosts is v dependent and smaller than a corresponding ratio Qeq measured in equilibrium by a value corresponding to PA on the outer surface. This fraction is released with a rate constant, k5, which is of the order of 1 s-1. The data suggest a maximum PA transport capacity, Jmax, of 2 pmol min-1 cm-2, 0 degrees C, pH 7.3.	eng	297	307	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1064	2	1991	May	07	D017878;D012856/Q000031;D012856/Q000494;D001692;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D010168/Q000493;D012710/Q000494	4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid;4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/analogs & derivatives;4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/pharmacology;Biological Transport;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Palmitates/pharmacokinetics;Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology	Bojesen IN;Bojesen E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
460	1851158	Nucleoside diphosphate kinase from human erythrocytes. Structural characterization of the two polypeptide chains responsible for heterogeneity of the hexameric enzyme.	Human erythrocyte nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase) is a hexameric enzyme consisting of two kinds of polypeptide chains, A and B. By random association (A6, A5B...AB5, B6) these polypeptides form isoenzymes differing in their isoelectric point. Chains A and B of NDP kinase were purified by ion-exchange chromatography under denaturing conditions. Upon mixing and renaturation, the isozymic pattern of NDP kinase obtained by conventional methods was restored. Antibodies raised against purified chains showed significant cross-reactivity, both in immunoblot experiments and activity inhibition studies. Sequence determination showed that both chains consisted of 152 amino acid residues corresponding to Mr or 17,143 (chain A) and 17,294 (chain B), respectively. There was high homology between the two sequences (88% identity). The phosphorylation site on the enzyme is located at His-118. Chain A was identical with human Nm23 protein, which has been reported as a potential suppressor protein in tumor metastasis and chain B was identical with Nm23-H2 protein.	eng	8784	8789	The Journal of biological chemistry	266	14	1991	May	15	D000595;D015153;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D046911;D008969;D009701/Q000097;D009701/Q000737;D009701/Q000276;D010449;D010766;D013045;D013329	Amino Acid Sequence;Blotting, Western;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Macromolecular Substances;Molecular Sequence Data;Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/blood;Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/chemistry;Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/immunology;Peptide Mapping;Phosphorylation;Species Specificity;Structure-Activity Relationship	Gilles AM;Presecan E;Vonica A;Lascu I	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
461	1659210	Glycine transport by human red blood cells and ghosts: evidence for glycine anion and proton cotransport by band 3.	Stilbene-sensitive glycine transport was investigated in human red blood cells and ghosts. We have found that this component of glycine transport was inhibited by the stilbene derivatives 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DNDS) and 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS); the apparent constant for inhibition by DNDS was 4 microM in the presence of 150 mM chloride. DNDS-sensitive glycine influx was modulated by pH such that as pH was increased from 5.9 to 9.2, transport increased from 2.5 to 140 mumol.kg Hb-1.h-1 at 37 degrees C and 100 microM glycine. The increased transport was correlated with an increase in the amount of glycine present as the anion over this pH range (0.03-40 microM glycine anion), but, in addition, pH had a direct effect on transport. Glycine influx was studied as a function of glycine anion concentration with anion varied by changing pH at a constant total glycine concentration and by changing total glycine at a constant pH. A comparison of these data demonstrated that the stilbene-sensitive glycine anion flux is stimulated by protons with half-maximal stimulation below pH 6.5 and suggests that the glycine anion and a proton are cotransported. Inorganic anions transported by band 3, including Cl, NO3, and SO4, inhibited glycine transport. Glycine flux into resealed ghosts was inhibited by Cl with an inhibition constant of 25 mM. The similarities between the kinetic constants for transport inhibition by Cl and DNDS and the kinetic constants for Cl and DNDS binding to band 3 suggest that the DNDS-sensitive glycine anion and proton cotransport is via band 3.	eng	C814	C821	The American journal of physiology	261	5 Pt 1	1991	Nov		D017878;D012856/Q000031;D012856/Q000494;D027321;D000838;D001692/Q000187;D002352/Q000378;D002712/Q000494;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005998/Q000097;D006801;D006863;D009994;D011522;D012964/Q000494;D013267/Q000494	4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid;4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/analogs & derivatives;4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/pharmacology;Anion Transport Proteins;Anions;Biological Transport/drug effects;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Chlorides/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycine/blood;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Osmolar Concentration;Protons;Sodium/pharmacology;Stilbenes/pharmacology	King PA;Gunn RB	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
462	1326679	Thiamine transport by erythrocytes and ghosts in thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia.	A 9-year study of thiamine metabolism and cellular transport was performed in two patients with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia associated with diabetes mellitus and sensorineural deafness, in their relatives, and in age-matched controls from the same area. The ratios between the content of thiamine and that of its phosphoesters in erythrocytes were within the normal range, whereas the absolute values of thiamine and thiamine compounds were reduced by about 40% as compared to controls. Thiamine pyrophosphokinase activity was about 30% lower than in controls. Thiamine treatment restored the levels of thiamine and thiamine compounds to normal values, whereas kinase was unaffected. Both the saturable (specific, predominant at low, less than 2 mumol/L, physiological concentrations of thiamine) and the non-saturable component of thiamine transport were investigated. Erythrocytes and ghosts from patients exhibited no saturable component, this abnormality being specific for the patients and not shared by their parents. It is concluded that the cells from thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia patients contain low levels of thiamine compounds, probably due to their inability to take up and retain physiological concentrations of thiamine, as a result of the lack of the saturable, specific component of transport and reduced thiamine pyrophosphokinase.	eng	231	242	Journal of inherited metabolic disease	15	2	1992			D000749/Q000097;D000749/Q000188;D001692;D002675;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D007700;D008297;D013836/Q000097;D013831/Q000097;D013831/Q000627	Anemia, Megaloblastic/blood;Anemia, Megaloblastic/drug therapy;Biological Transport;Child, Preschool;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Kinetics;Male;Thiamin Pyrophosphokinase/blood;Thiamine/blood;Thiamine/therapeutic use	Rindi G;Casirola D;Poggi V;De Vizia B;Patrini C;Laforenza U	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
463	1322411	Purification and characterization of vitamin B6-phosphate phosphatase from human erythrocytes.	Human erythrocytes rapidly convert vitamin B6 to pyridoxal-P and contain soluble phosphatase activity which dephosphorylates pyridoxal-P at a pH optimum of 6-6.5. This phosphatase was purified 51,000-fold with a yield of 39% by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-200, hydroxylapatite, and reactive yellow 86-agarose. Sephacryl S-200 chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme was a dimer with a molecular mass of approximately 64 kDa. The phosphatase required Mg2+ for activity. It specifically catalyzed the removal of phosphate from pyridoxal-P, pyridoxine-P, pyridoxamine-P, 4-pyridoxic acid-P, and 4-deoxypyridoxine-P at pH 7.4. Nucleotide phosphates, phosphoamino acids, and other phosphorylated compounds were not hydrolyzed significantly nor were they effective inhibitors of the enzyme. The phosphatase showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with its substrates. It had a Km of 1.5 microM and a Vmax of 3.2 mumol/min/mg with pyridoxal-P. The Vmax/Km was greatest with pyridoxal-P greater than 4-pyridoxic acid-P greater than pyridoxine-P greater than pyridoxamine-P. The phosphatase was competitively inhibited by the product, inorganic phosphate, with a Ki of 0.8 mM, and weakly inhibited by pyridoxal. It was also inhibited by Zn2+, fluoride, molybdate, and EDTA, but was not inhibited by levamisole, L-phenylalanine, or L(+)-tartrate. These properties of the purified enzyme suggest that it is a unique acid phosphatase that specifically dephosphorylates vitamin B6-phosphates.	eng	15978	15983	The Journal of biological chemistry	267	22	1992	Aug	05	D002845;D002846;D002850;D002852;D017886;D004591;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006882;D007700;D008970;D010744/Q000097;D010744/Q000302;D011730/Q000031;D011730/Q000494;D013379	Chromatography;Chromatography, Affinity;Chromatography, Gel;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Durapatite;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydroxyapatites;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/blood;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/isolation & purification;Pyridoxal/analogs & derivatives;Pyridoxal/pharmacology;Substrate Specificity	Fonda ML	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
464	1463467	Possible multifunction of glucose transporter. Transport of nicotinamide by reconstituted liposomes.	A kinetic study of the uptake of nicotinamide by reconstituted liposomes containing the human erythrocyte glucose transporter, compared with that of D-glucose, demonstrated that the Km and Vmax. values were almost the same for each compound, and that the uptake of D-glucose was competitively inhibited by nicotinamide. At 20 mM concentration, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, 3-O-methyl-D-glucose and 4,6-O-ethylidene-D-glucose all caused 50% inhibition of nicotinamide uptake, but L-glucose and nicotinic acid were not inhibitory. Similar results were obtained for the uptake of D-glucose. Cytochalasin B binding to the liposomes was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by either nicotinamide or D-glucose. Antibody for glucose transporter detected in band 4.5 by SDS/PAGE inhibited the uptake of D-glucose and nicotinamide. A possible uptake of nicotinamide by nucleoside transporter was excluded. In human erythrocytes, cytochalasin B binding was inhibited dose-dependently by either nicotinamide or D-glucose, and cytochalasin B depressed the uptake of both nicotinamide and 2-deoxy-D-glucose. These findings were well reproduced in the reconstituted liposomes. The very close similarities between uptake of nicotinamide and D-glucose suggest that the glucose transporter plays a direct role in transport of nicotinamide, which is structurally quite different from monosaccharides, and thus that the transporter is probably multifunctional.	eng	669	674	The Biochemical journal	288 ( Pt 2)	Pt 2	1992	Dec	01	D001692/Q000187;D003571/Q000378;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D007700;D008081;D009004/Q000378;D009536/Q000378;D013868/Q000031;D013868/Q000494	Biological Transport/drug effects;Cytochalasin B/metabolism;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Liposomes;Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/metabolism;Niacinamide/metabolism;Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives;Thioinosine/pharmacology	Sofue M;Yoshimura Y;Nishida M;Kawada J	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
465	1463749	High control coefficient of transketolase in the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway of human erythrocytes: NMR, antibody, and computer simulation studies.	"The degree of control exerted by transketolase over metabolite flux in the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway in human erythrocytes was investigated using transketolase antiserum to modulate the activity of that enzyme. 31P NMR enabled the simultaneous measurement of the levels of pentose phosphate pathway metabolites following incubation of hemolysates with ribose 5-phosphate. The variations in metabolic flux which occurred as the transketolase activity of hemolysate samples was altered indicated that a high degree of control was exerted by transketolase. Investigations using transaldolase-depleted hemolysates showed that transaldolase exhibits a lesser degree of control over pathway flux. Experimental data were compared with simulations generated by a computer model encompassing the reactions of the classical nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway. The sensitivity coefficients (also called ""control strengths"" or ""flux-control coefficients"") calculated from the computer simulations were 0.74 and 0.03 for transketolase and transaldolase, respectively."	eng	12792	12798	Biochemistry	31	51	1992	Dec	29	D015153;D003198;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007106;D007700;D008163;D009682;D010427;D010428/Q000097;D012267/Q000097;D012274/Q000097;D014174/Q000097;D014174/Q000276	Blotting, Western;Computer Simulation;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Immune Sera;Kinetics;Luminescent Measurements;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Pentose Phosphate Pathway;Pentosephosphates/blood;Ribosemonophosphates/blood;Ribulosephosphates/blood;Transketolase/blood;Transketolase/immunology	Berthon HA;Kuchel PW;Nixon PF	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
466	1736046	Measurements of tissue sorbitol in diabetes mellitus: enzyme method versus gas-liquid chromatography.	Two methods are commonly used to measure sorbitol in mammalian tissues. The first uses sorbitol dehydrogenase for a coupled enzymatic reaction; unfortunately, other polyols are also substrates for this enzyme. The second uses gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) for separation of polyols and mass quantitation of sorbitol. A comparison of these two methods for the measurement of sorbitol in duplicate samples of lens, nerve, and erythrocytes indicates that GLC of polyol acetates consistently finds less sorbitol than measured by sorbitol dehydrogenase. Erythritol, threitol, ribitol, arabitol, and galactitol are polyols found in variable quantities in these tissues, which have a variable influence on the activity of sorbitol dehydrogenase and therefore alter sorbitol quantitation with this enzyme. Moreover, there is an unidentified substance(s) that reacts with sorbitol dehydrogenase which seems to increase in association with hyperglycemia in the lens and nerve, but not in erythrocytes. The quantity of this unknown substance(s) seems to be reduced by the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil in erythrocytes and to a lesser extent sciatic nerve and lens. Since enzymatic sorbitol quantitation in the lens, nerve, and erythrocytes is influenced by many known and unknown factors other than sorbitol, we recommend that GLC of polyol acetates be used to measure sorbitol in biologic tissues.	eng	224	227	Metabolism: clinical and experimental	41	2	1992	Feb		D000449/Q000037;D000704;D000818;D002849/Q000379;D003920/Q000097;D003921/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006943/Q000097;D007093/Q000494;D048289;D007064;D007908/Q000187;D007908/Q000378;D008297;D051381;D011919;D012584/Q000187;D012584/Q000378;D013012/Q000032;D013012/Q000097;D013012/Q000378;D013050/Q000379;D013402/Q000378	Aldehyde Reductase/antagonists & inhibitors;Analysis of Variance;Animals;Chromatography, Gas/methods;Diabetes Mellitus/blood;Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hyperglycemia/blood;Imidazoles/pharmacology;Imidazolidines;L-Iditol 2-Dehydrogenase;Lens, Crystalline/drug effects;Lens, Crystalline/metabolism;Male;Rats;Rats, Inbred Strains;Sciatic Nerve/drug effects;Sciatic Nerve/metabolism;Sorbitol/analysis;Sorbitol/blood;Sorbitol/metabolism;Spectrometry, Fluorescence/methods;Sugar Alcohols/metabolism	Malone JI;Lowitt S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

An aminopeptidase hydrolyzing 2-naphthylamides of Lys, Arg, Leu, Met, Phe and Tyr, as well as different di- to tridecapeptides, was purified from the cytosol of human erythrocytes. The enzyme showed preference for Lys and Arg at N-terminus, as proline and D-amino acids were nonpermissive at P1' site. Higher affinity for oligopeptides than for aminoacyl naphthylamides was observed. Among the substrates were Lys-bradykinin, angiotensin III, thymopentin and enkephalins. Aminopeptidase was shown to be a monomeric protein of M(r) approximately 110000 and of pI approximately 4.8, activated by Co2+ and inhibited by EDTA, pHMB, amastatin, bestatin and puromycin. The isolated enzyme could be classified as cytosolic, Lys(Arg) preferring, broad specificity aminopeptidase.	eng	375	380	Biological chemistry Hoppe-Seyler	373	7	1992	Jul		D000595;D000596/Q000378;D000626/Q000097;D000626/Q000302;D003600/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007525;D007700;D008969;D008970;D013379	Amino Acid Sequence;Amino Acids/metabolism;Aminopeptidases/blood;Aminopeptidases/isolation & purification;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Isoelectric Focusing;Kinetics;Molecular Sequence Data;Molecular Weight;Substrate Specificity	Abramić M;Vitale L	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
468	1623596	Homocysteine export from erythrocytes and its implication for plasma sampling.	The concentration of free and total homocysteine in plasma increases in time if blood is stored uncentrifuged after sampling. The increase is temperature dependent and the maximal increase in total plasma homocysteine at 37 degrees C was 3.0 mumol.L-1.h-1. Even at 4 degrees C there is a substantial increase, particularly of free plasma homocysteine. Plasma glutathione, cysteinylglycine, and gamma-glutamylcysteine also show an increase in time if whole blood is stored, whereas cysteine decreases. We show that the erythrocytes are responsible for most of the increase in plasma homocysteine and suggest that homocysteine is derived from adenosylmethionine-dependent protein carboxymethylations in the cells. We conclude that strict sampling conditions are necessary when plasma homocysteine and especially its free fraction are assayed.	eng	1311	1315	Clinical chemistry	38	7	1992	Jul		D000328;D001692;D004151/Q000097;D004492/Q000494;D004912/Q000378;D005978/Q000097;D006710/Q000097;D006801;D007700;D007962/Q000378;D008875;D013696;D013997	Adult;Biological Transport;Dipeptides/blood;Edetic Acid/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glutathione/blood;Homocysteine/blood;Humans;Kinetics;Leukocytes/metabolism;Middle Aged;Temperature;Time Factors	Andersson A;Isaksson A;Hultberg B	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
469	1599419	Fructose metabolism in the human erythrocyte. Phosphorylation to fructose 3-phosphate.	In human erythrocytes, the first step in the metabolism of fructose is generally thought to be phosphorylation to fructose 6-phosphate catalysed by hexokinase. In variance with this assumption, we show here that fructose in these cells is metabolized primarily to fructose 3-phosphate by a specific 3-phosphokinase. This process has an overall estimated Km of 30 mM with respect to extracellular fructose and an apparent Vmax. of 0.6 mumol/h per ml. At a fixed concentration of fructose in the medium, the accumulation of fructose 3-phosphate was linearly dependent on the duration of incubation up to 5 h and was not affected by glucose. Once accumulated, fructose 3-phosphate appears to be degraded and/or relatively slowly metabolized, decreasing by only approximately 30% after a 12 h incubation in a fructose-free medium.	eng	363	366	The Biochemical journal	284 ( Pt 2)	Pt 2	1992	Jun	01	D004912/Q000378;D005632/Q000378;D005636/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D009682;D010766	Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fructose/metabolism;Fructosephosphates/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Phosphorylation	Petersen A;Kappler F;Szwergold BS;Brown TR	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
470	1618773	Role of carnitine and carnitine palmitoyltransferase as integral components of the pathway for membrane phospholipid fatty acid turnover in intact human erythrocytes.	The deacylation and reacylation process of phospholipids is the major pathway of turnover and repair in erythrocyte membranes. In this paper, we have investigated the role of carnitine palmitoyltransferase in erythrocyte membrane phospholipid fatty acid turnover. The role of acyl-L-carnitine as a reservoir of activated acyl groups, the buffer function of carnitine, and the importance of the acyl-CoA/free CoA ratio in the reacylation process of erythrocyte membrane phospholipids have also been addressed. In intact erythrocytes, the incorporation of [1-14C]palmitic acid into acyl-L-carnitine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine was linear with time for at least 3 h. The greatest proportion of the radioactivity was found in acyl-L-carnitine. Competition experiments using [1-14C]palmitic and [9,10-3H]oleic acid demonstrated that [9,10-3H]oleic acid was incorporated preferentially into the phospholipids and less into acyl-L-carnitine. When an erythrocyte suspension was incubated with [1-14C]palmitoyl-L-carnitine, radiolabeled palmitate was recovered in the phospholipid fraction, and the carnitine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor, 2-tetradecylglycidic acid, completely abolished the incorporation. ATP depletion decreased incorporation of [1-14C]palmitic and/or [9,10-3H]oleic acid into acyl-L-carnitine, but the incorporation into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine was unaffected. In contrast, ATP depletion enhanced the incorporation into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine of the radiolabeled fatty acid from [1-14C]palmitoyl-L-carnitine. These data are suggestive of the existence of an acyl-L-carnitine pool, in equilibrium with the acyl-CoA pool, which serves as a reservoir of activated acyl groups. The carnitine palmitoyltransferase inhibition by 2-tetradecylglycidic acid or palmitoyl-D-carnitine caused a significant reduction of radiolabeled fatty acid incorporation into membrane phospholipids, only when intact erythrocytes were incubated with [9,10-3H]oleic acid. These latter data may be explained by the differences in rates and substrates specificities between acyl-CoA synthetase and the reacylating enzymes for palmitate and oleate, which support the importance of carnitine palmitoyltransferase in modulating the optimal acyl-CoA/free CoA ratio for the physiological expression of the membrane phospholipids fatty acid turnover.	eng	12673	12681	The Journal of biological chemistry	267	18	1992	Jun	25	D000215;D000255/Q000378;D002331/Q000502;D002334/Q000378;D002855;D003847/Q000378;D004910/Q000201;D004910/Q000378;D005227/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D007700;D008563/Q000378;D019308;D010169/Q000378;D010743/Q000378	Acylation;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Carnitine/physiology;Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase/metabolism;Chromatography, Thin Layer;Deoxyglucose/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Fatty Acids/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Membrane Lipids/metabolism;Palmitic Acid;Palmitic Acids/metabolism;Phospholipids/metabolism	Arduini A;Mancinelli G;Radatti GL;Dottori S;Molajoni F;Ramsay RR	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
471	1547895	Nitroprusside stimulates the cysteine-specific mono(ADP-ribosylation) of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes.	In human erythrocyte membranes incubated with [adenylate-32P]NAD the 36 kDa protein is predominantly labeled. The labeling is greatly stimulated by nitroprusside in the presence of dithiothreitol. We have purified the 36 kDa protein and identified this modification as cysteine-specific mono(ADP-ribosylation) because: (i) labeling occurred only when [32P]NAD was replaced by adenine[U-14C]NAD, but not by [carbonyl-14C]NAD; (ii) treatment of the prelabeled protein with snake venom phosphodiesterase led to releasing 5'-[32P]AMP; (iii) the bond between the protein and the nucleotide was hydrolyzed by HgCl2, but was resistant to hydroxylamine. The 36 kDa protein reacted on Western blots with two different monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and was immunoprecipitated by both MAbs.	eng	9	12	FEBS letters	300	1	1992	Mar	23	D000246/Q000378;D015153;D003545/Q000737;D003545/Q000378;D004910/Q000201;D005987/Q000737;D005987/Q000378;D006801;D009599/Q000494;D011233	Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Blotting, Western;Cysteine/chemistry;Cysteine/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/chemistry;Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/metabolism;Humans;Nitroprusside/pharmacology;Precipitin Tests	Kots AYa None;Skurat AV;Sergienko EA;Bulargina TV;Severin ES	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
472	1318025	Purification and characterization of human erythrocyte phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate 4-kinase are distinct enzymes.	PtdIns 4-kinase has been purified 83,000-fold from human erythrocyte membranes. The major protein detected by SDS/PAGE is of molecular mass 56 kDa, and enzymic activity can be renatured from this band of the gel. The characteristics of this enzyme are similar to other type II PtdIns kinases previously described: PtdIns presented in Triton X-100 micelles is preferred as a substrate over PtdIns vesicles, the enzyme possesses a relatively low Km for ATP (20 microM), and adenosine is an effective inhibitor. A monoclonal antibody raised against bovine brain type II PtdIns 4-kinase is an effective inhibitor of the purified enzyme. PtdIns(4,5)P2 inhibits by approx. 50% when added in equimolar amounts with PtdIns; PtdIns4P has little effect on activity. A PtdIns3P 4-kinase activity has also been detected in erythrocyte lysates. Approximately two-thirds of this activity is in the cytosolic fraction and one-third in the membrane fraction. No PtdIns3P 4-kinase activity could be detected in the purified type II PtdIns 4-kinase preparation, nor could this activity be detected in a bovine brain type III PtdIns 4-kinase preparation. The monoclonal antibody that inhibits the type II PtdIns 4-kinase does not affect the PtdIns3P 4-kinase activity in the membrane fraction. The cytosolic PtdIns3P 4-kinase can be efficiently recovered from a 60%-satd.-(NH4)2SO4 precipitate that is virtually free of PtdIns 4-kinase activity. We conclude that PtdIns3P 4-kinase is a new enzyme distinct from previously characterized PtdIns 4-kinases, and that this enzyme prefers PtdIns3P over PtdIns as a substrate.	eng	39	45	The Biochemical journal	284 ( Pt 1)	Pt 1	1992	May	15	D019870;D000911;D003600/Q000201;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008970;D010766;D010770/Q000037;D010770/Q000097;D010770/Q000302	1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase;Antibodies, Monoclonal;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Molecular Weight;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases/antagonists & inhibitors;Phosphotransferases/blood;Phosphotransferases/isolation & purification	Graziani A;Ling LE;Endemann G;Carpenter CL;Cantley LC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Both of these phosphoric diester hydrolase activities were activated to different extents by different concentrations of calcium ions. Differences between the two activities were also observed on inhibition by barium and phosphate ions.

474	1443104	Erythrocyte K-Cl cotransport: properties and regulation.	Erythrocytes possess a Cl-dependent, Na-independent K transport system cotransporting K and Cl in a 1:1 stoichiometry that is membrane potential independent. This K-Cl cotransporter is stimulated by cell swelling, acidification, Mg depletion, and thiol modification. Cell shrinkage, elevation of cellular divalent ions, thiol alkylation, phosphatase inhibitors, and derivatives of certain loop diuretics and stilbenes are inhibitory. Thus regulation of K-Cl cotransport at the membrane and cytoplasmic levels is highly complex. Basal K-Cl cotransport decreases with cellular maturation, whereas its modes of stimulation and inhibition are variable between species. The physiological inactivation appears to be prevented in low-K animal erythrocytes. In certain human hemoglobinopathies, K-Cl cotransport may be the cause of cellular dehydration and volume decrease. K-Cl cotransport occurs also in nonerythroid cells, such as in epithelial and liver cells of other species. At the threshold of molecular characterization, this comprehensive review places our present understanding of the mechanisms modulating K-Cl cotransport physiologically and pathophysiologically into kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives.	eng	C917	C932	The American journal of physiology	263	5 Pt 1	1992	Nov		D000818;D002352/Q000037;D002352/Q000097;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008954;D015398;D027981;D013816;D000096922	Animals;Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors;Carrier Proteins/blood;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Models, Biological;Signal Transduction;Symporters;Thermodynamics;K Cl- Cotransporters	Lauf PK;Bauer J;Adragna NC;Fujise H;Zade-Oppen AM;Ryu KH;Delpire E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True

476	1332781	Identification, purification and reconstitution of thiamin metabolizing enzymes in human red blood cells.	Thiamin and its mono- (TMP), di- (TDP) and triphosphate (TTP) were assayed in adult human whole blood using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). TDP and TTP were detected in red blood cells (RBC), but not in plasma. After incubation with 20 microM thiamin and 5 mM glucose for 2 h, the TDP and TTP contents of RBC increased from 111 to 222 and 0.6 to 2.2 nmol/l of packed RBC, respectively, suggesting enzymatic conversion of thiamin to TDP and then to TTP. Thiamin pyrophosphokinase (TPK, EC 2.7.6.2) had not been isolated before from human materials, nor had cytosolic adenylate kinase (AK1, EC 2.7.4.3) in human RBC been demonstrated to catalyze the phosphorylation of TDP to TTP, although AK1 from pig and chicken skeletal muscle possess TTP-synthesizing activity. TPK and AK1 in a human RBC lysate were therefore purified by a series of the conventional techniques. The specific activity of the purified TPK, which was obtained as a single protein, was 720 nmol TDP formed/mg protein per h at 37 degrees C. A partially purified AK1 preparation catalyzed the formation of TTP from TDP (specific activity, 170 nmol/mg protein per h at 37 degrees C) in addition to its proper reaction to form ATP from ADP. After incubation of the purified TPK and AK1 with 20 microM thiamin in the presence of ATP, ADP and Mg2+ at 37 degrees C for 48 h, the amounts of TDP and TTP synthesized were 465 and 54.0 pmol/250 microliters reaction mixture, respectively. Neither TDP nor TTP was formed when TPK was omitted from the reaction mixture and an omission of AK1 resulted in the formation of TDP alone. These results indicate that thiamin is converted to TDP by TPK and, subsequently, to TTP by AK1 in human RBC.	eng	171	178	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1160	2	1992	Nov	20	D000263/Q000302;D000263/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D013836/Q000302;D013836/Q000378;D013831/Q000097;D013831/Q000378;D013835/Q000096;D013835/Q000097;D013838/Q000096;D013838/Q000097	Adenylate Kinase/isolation & purification;Adenylate Kinase/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Thiamin Pyrophosphokinase/isolation & purification;Thiamin Pyrophosphokinase/metabolism;Thiamine/blood;Thiamine/metabolism;Thiamine Pyrophosphate/biosynthesis;Thiamine Pyrophosphate/blood;Thiamine Triphosphate/biosynthesis;Thiamine Triphosphate/blood	Egi Y;Koyama S;Shioda T;Yamada K;Kawasaki T	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
477	1417776	Isolation of cDNA clones for a 50 kDa glycoprotein of the human erythrocyte membrane associated with Rh (rhesus) blood-group antigen expression.	The Rh blood-group antigens are associated with human erythrocyte membrane proteins of approx. 30 kDa (the Rh30 polypeptides). Heterogeneously glycosylated membrane proteins of 50 and 45 kDa (the Rh50 glycoproteins) are coprecipitated with the Rh30 polypeptides on immunoprecipitation with anti-Rh-specific mono- and poly-clonal antibodies. We have isolated cDNA clones representing a member of the Rh50 glycoprotein family (the Rh50A glycoprotein). We used PCR with degenerate primers based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the Rh50 glycoproteins and human genomic DNA as a template and cloned and sequenced three types of PCR product of the expected size. Two of these products, Rh50A and Rh50B, gave the same translated amino acid sequence which corresponded to the expected Rh50 glycoprotein sequence but had only 75% DNA sequence similarity. The third product (Rh50C) contained a single base deletion, and the translated amino acid sequence contained an in-frame stop codon. We have isolated cDNA clones containing the full coding sequence of the Rh50A glycoprotein. This sequence predicts that it is a 409-amino acid N-glycosylated membrane protein with up to 12 transmembrane domains. The Rh50A glycoprotein shows clear similarity to the Rh30A protein in both amino acid sequence and predicted topology. Our results are consistent with the Rh30 and Rh50 groups of proteins being different subunits of an oligomeric complex which is likely to have a transport or channel function in the erythrocyte membrane. We mapped the Rh50A gene to human chromosome 6p21-qter, showing that genetic differences in the Rh30 rather than the Rh50 genes specify the major polymorphic forms of the Rh antigens.	eng	223	228	The Biochemical journal	287 ( Pt 1)	Pt 1	1992	Oct	01	D000595;D001483;D002896;D003001;D004910/Q000737;D006801;D008562/Q000235;D008969;D009838/Q000737;D016133;D017433;D012204/Q000737;D012204/Q000235;D016415	Amino Acid Sequence;Base Sequence;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6;Cloning, Molecular;Erythrocyte Membrane/chemistry;Humans;Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics;Molecular Sequence Data;Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Protein Structure, Secondary;Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/chemistry;Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/genetics;Sequence Alignment	Ridgwell K;Spurr NK;Laguda B;MacGeoch C;Avent ND;Tanner MJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
478	1382721	Normal human erythrocytes express CD36, an adhesion molecule of monocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells.	We have recently shown that rosetting of Plasmodium falciparum (MC R+ line)-infected erythrocytes (parasitized red blood cells [PRBCs]) with uninfected erythrocytes (RBCs) is blocked by coating of the RBCs with anti-CD36 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs; Handunnetti et al, Blood 80:2097, 1992). Adult RBCs have previously been considered negative for CD36. However, using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis with the anti-CD36 MoAbs 8A6, OKM5, and OKM8, which reverse rosetting, we consistently detect CD36 on the majority of normal adult RBCs. Absorption of the MoAb solutions with CD36-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-CD36) cells removed the reactivity against both CHO-CD36 cells and RBCs, whereas absorption with CHO cells had no effect. By comparison with staining for glycophorin A, LFA-3, and CR1, the level of expression of CD36 appeared to be low. Nevertheless, normal RBCs were capable of adhering to plastic coated with anti-CD36 MoAbs. RBCs from one African malaria patient were identified as deficient in CD36 and these RBCs did not rosette with the patient's own P falciparum PRBCs, even though these PRBCs were capable of rosetting with RBCs from a normal donor in a CD36-dependent manner. Therefore, the level of expression of CD36 on normal RBCs is sufficient to be important in cell adherence, and may have a biologic role in normal individuals as well as in the pathology of P falciparum malaria.	eng	2105	2114	Blood	80	8	1992	Oct	15	D000818;D000911;D015703/Q000032;D015703/Q000235;D015703/Q000276;D001792/Q000276;D018955;D016466;D002448;D006224;D004727/Q000276;D004912/Q000276;D004912/Q000469;D004912/Q000502;D005434;D006801;D007163;D016778/Q000097;D016778/Q000276;D016778/Q000469;D009000/Q000276;D010963/Q000276;D012397;D014162	Animals;Antibodies, Monoclonal;Antigens, CD/analysis;Antigens, CD/genetics;Antigens, CD/immunology;Blood Platelets/immunology;CD36 Antigens;CHO Cells;Cell Adhesion;Cricetinae;Endothelium/immunology;Erythrocytes/immunology;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Erythrocytes/physiology;Flow Cytometry;Humans;Immunosorbent Techniques;Malaria, Falciparum/blood;Malaria, Falciparum/immunology;Malaria, Falciparum/parasitology;Monocytes/immunology;Plasmodium falciparum/immunology;Rosette Formation;Transfection	van Schravendijk MR;Handunnetti SM;Barnwell JW;Howard RJ	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
479	1443581	Determination of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase activity in human erythrocytes: high-performance liquid chromatography-linked method.	A radiochemical reverse-phase-high-performance liquid chromatography-linked method to measure the activity of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.12) in crude lysates of human red blood cells is described. The apparent Km for nicotinamide was in the micromolar range, much lower than that described in human erythrocytes in the past. The enzyme activity in crude hemolysates was found to be extremely low (21 +/- 3.5 nmol x h-1 x g-1 Hb); nevertheless, the low Km for nicotinamide might account for the production of pyridine nucleotides reported by us for intact erythrocytes incubated at low, physiological concentrations of this substrate.	eng	334	336	Analytical biochemistry	205	2	1992	Sep		D002250;D002851/Q000379;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D054409;D010430/Q000097	Carbon Radioisotopes;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase;Pentosyltransferases/blood	Rocchigiani M;Micheli V;Duley JA;Simmonds HA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
480	7508288	Melanin quantitation from human erythrocytes; interference by haeme derivatives.	Precipitates were obtained by 6 N HCl hydrolysis of human erythrocytes and subsequent extractions with ethanol-ether 1:1 and with tetrahydrofuran. The mean quantity of these precipitates (n = 16) was 16.60 +/- 1.60 (standard deviation) mg/ml, (15.09 +/- 1.45 mg/g) and from saline washed erythrocyte samples (n = 8) 16.65 +/- 0.73 mg/ml, (15.14 +/- 0.67 mg/g). A large part of these precipitates (about 74%) is associated with haemoglobin (in average 12.34 mg/ml). Melanins account for the difference (16.60-12.34) = 4.26 mg/ml, approximately 8.7% of haemoglobin-free erythrocyte solids. Precipitates from red cells, and from haemoglobin produced similar UV-VIS and IR spectra. The precipitates from haemoglobin are mainly derivatives of haeme (about 97%); the remaining approximately 3% are melanins from globin. The total melanins are about 1.3% of haeme-free solids of erythrocytes. Precipitation from the erythrocytes with 6 N HCl was also achieved in practically complete argon atmosphere, and similar quantities were obtained as those in air with the same UV-VIS and IR spectra. Since granules or solid particles are not found in the cytoplasm of normal human erythrocytes, we conclude that soluble melanins are present. Small amounts of melanins can be present in the membranes as well, since the precursors of melanins: norepinephrine, epinephrine are present in these membranes.	eng	289	295	Archives internationales de physiologie, de biochimie et de biophysique	101	5	1993			D000328;D000368;D000369;D011232;D004837/Q000097;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000737;D005260;D006418;D006801;D006851;D008297;D008543/Q000097;D008875;D009638/Q000097;D013055;D013056	Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Chemical Precipitation;Epinephrine/blood;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Female;Heme;Humans;Hydrochloric Acid;Male;Melanins/blood;Middle Aged;Norepinephrine/blood;Spectrophotometry, Infrared;Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet	Hegedus ZL;Nayak U	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
481	8487505	Membrane-bound sorbitol dehydrogenase in human red blood cells. Studies in normal subjects and in enzyme-deficient subjects with congenital cataracts.	Membrane-bound and soluble forms of erythrocyte sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) activity are compared in normal individuals. Both isoenzymes showed similar properties. In a family with red cell SORD deficiency and congenital cataracts, Km values for sorbitol and NAD+ as well as the effect of the enzymatic deficiency on sorbitol accumulation in red cells incubated in high-glucose or high-fructose media were determined. In SORD-deficient patients, the enzymatic deficiency was observed in both crude haemolysate and SORD-M preparations with sorbitol, galactitol, xylitol or ribitol as substrates. The mutation responsible for SORD deficiency did not modify the Km for sorbitol and NAD+. Finally, SORD deficiency produced a significant increase of sorbitol accumulation in red cells incubated in high-concentration glucose media and a significant decrease when the cells were incubated in high-concentration fructose media.	eng	67	72	Journal of inherited metabolic disease	16	1	1993			D002386/Q000151;D002386/Q000201;D002386/Q000235;D004910/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007527/Q000097;D007700;D007064/Q000097;D007064/Q000172;D008297;D010375;D010641;D013012/Q000097;D013050;D013056;D013379	Cataract/congenital;Cataract/enzymology;Cataract/genetics;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Female;Humans;Isoenzymes/blood;Kinetics;L-Iditol 2-Dehydrogenase/blood;L-Iditol 2-Dehydrogenase/deficiency;Male;Pedigree;Phenotype;Sorbitol/blood;Spectrometry, Fluorescence;Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet;Substrate Specificity	Alvarez A;Martínez A;Ibarra B;Medina C;Bracamontes M;Perea J;Vaca G	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
482		Erythrocyte uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase deficiency identified by newborn screening for galactosemia in the United States	Eight infants (two whites and six blacks) with erythrocyte uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase (epimerase) deficiency were identified in four newborn screening programs for galactosemia in the United States. The initial biochemical findings in all cases were elevated blood galactose-l-phosphate with normal or only slightly increased blood galactose and normal galactose-l-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) activity. Epimerase deficiency was confirmed in erythrocytes by a two-step enzymatic assay involving fluorometric measurements of NADH generated by coupling the uridine diphosphate glucose dehydrogenase reaction to epimerase. Seven of the eight infants appeared to be clinically normal at birth and one newborn had neonatal jaundice. The infrequent recognition of epimerase deficiency is likely due to the methods of newborn screening for galactosemia which are often only for GALT deficiency and perhaps also due to incomplete follow-up of increased metabolite levels in newborn blood specimens with normal GALT activity. Our results confirm a preliminary report of a high frequency of erythrocyte epimerase deficiency in the American black population	eng	179	186	Screening	2	4	1993					Won G.

483	8476015	Transport of lactate and other monocarboxylates across mammalian plasma membranes.	Transport of L-lactate across the plasma membrane is of considerable importance to almost all mammalian cells. In most cells a specific H(+)-monocarboxylate cotransporter is largely responsible for this process; the capacity of this carrier is usually very high, to support the high rates of production or utilization of L-lactate. The best characterized H(+)-monocarboxylate transporter is that of the erythrocyte membrane, which transports L-lactate and a wide range of other aliphatic monocarboxylates, including pyruvate and the ketone bodies acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. This carrier is inhibited by alpha-cyanocinnamate derivatives and some stilbene disulfonates and has been identified as a protein of 35-50 kDa on the basis of purification and specific labeling experiments. Other cells possess similar alpha-cyanocinnamate-sensitive H(+)-linked monocarboxylate transporters, but in some cases there are significant differences in the properties of these systems, sufficient to suggest the existence of a family of such carriers. In particular, cardiac muscle and tumor cells have transporters that differ in their Km values for certain substrates (including stereoselectivity for L- over D-lactate) and in their sensitivity to inhibitors. Mitochondria, bacteria, and yeast also possess H(+)-monocarboxylate transporters that share some properties in common with those in the mammalian plasma membrane but are adapted to their specific roles. However, there are distinct Na(+)-monocarboxylate cotransporters on the luminal surface of intestinal and kidney epithelia, which enable active uptake of lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies in these tissues. This article reviews the properties of these transport systems and their role in mammalian metabolism.	eng	C761	C782	The American journal of physiology	264	4 Pt 1	1993	Apr		D000818;D001692;D002264/Q000378;D002352/Q000378;D002462/Q000378;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D007773/Q000378;D008322;D008954	Animals;Biological Transport;Carboxylic Acids/metabolism;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Lactates/metabolism;Mammals;Models, Biological	Poole RC;Halestrap AP	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
484	8386626	Generation of phosphatidic acid during calcium-loading of human erythrocytes. Evidence for a phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D.	We have studied the mechanism by which calcium-loading of human erythrocytes stimulates phospholipid turnover and generates diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. Using quantitative measurement of individual phospholipid classes, we have demonstrated that the amount of phosphatidic acid generated during calcium-loading of intact red cells exceeds the amount of diacylglycerol formed by phospholipase-C-mediated hydrolysis of the polyphosphoinositol lipids and that addition of the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor, R59022, only partly inhibited this increase. Thus, in contrast to current explanations, the phosphatidic acid generated following calcium-loading of erythrocytes cannot be solely explained by the action of a polyphosphoinositol-lipid-specific phospholipase C with subsequent phosphorylation of diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid. Our data demonstrate that calcium-loading of intact erythrocytes, but not of red cell ghost membranes, causes a small but significant decrease in the relative amount of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). In order to identify the mechanisms responsible for calcium-mediated hydrolysis of PtdCho, we encapsulated Ptd[Me-14C]Cho-containing rat liver microsomes into erythrocytes and studied the generation of [Me-14C]choline and phospho[Me-14C]choline. We found that choline was the only detectable 14C-labeled product. Furthermore, incubation of erythrocytes with calcium under hypotonic conditions and in the presence of [14C]PtdCho vesicles and ethanol resulted in the formation of [14C]phosphatidylethanol. Together, these results suggest that the loss of PtdCho during calcium-loading of human erythrocytes is caused by a previously unrecognized PtdCho-hydrolyzing phospholipase D, resulting in direct generation of phosphatidic acid. Analysis of the molecular species composition of PtdCho, phosphatidic acid, and diradylglycerol, confirm the simultaneous actions of PtdCho-hydrolyzing and polyphosphoinositol-lipid-hydrolyzing phospholipases in calcium-loaded human erythrocytes.	eng	367	375	European journal of biochemistry	213	1	1993	Apr	01	D000328;D000818;D002118/Q000378;D002478;D019852;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006868;D066298;D008563/Q000378;D008861/Q000378;D010712/Q000096;D010713/Q000378;D010739/Q000378;D010770/Q000037;D051381;D010738/Q000378	Adult;Animals;Calcium/metabolism;Cells, Cultured;Diacylglycerol Kinase;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrolysis;In Vitro Techniques;Membrane Lipids/metabolism;Microsomes/metabolism;Phosphatidic Acids/biosynthesis;Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism;Phospholipase D/metabolism;Phosphotransferases/antagonists & inhibitors;Rats;Type C Phospholipases/metabolism	Bütikofer P;Yee MC;Schott MA;Lubin BH;Kuypers FA	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
485	8254535	N-ethylmaleimide discriminates between two lysine transport systems in human erythrocytes.	1. The sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was shown to inactivate the low affinity lysine transporter in human erythrocytes (system y+) without affecting the high affinity transporter (system y+L). 2. Pre-treatment of the cells with NEM reduced the rate of entry of L-[14C]lysine (1 microM) by approximately 50% (maximum effect). 3. NEM (0.2 mM) inhibited the NEM-sensitive component of the flux with mono-exponential kinetics. The inactivation rate constant (k, +/- S.E.M.) was 0.53 +/- 0.027 min-1 (25 degrees C). The substrate did not protect against inactivation. 4. Lysine self-inhibition experiments revealed two transport systems in untreated cells (half-saturation constants Km; +/- S.E.M.), 12.0 +/- 1.7 microM and 109 +/- 15.6 microM) and only one high affinity system in NEM-treated cells (Km 9.5 +/- 0.67 microM), indicating that NEM inactivates system y+. 5. The NEM-insensitive L-[14C]lysine influx (system y+L) was inhibited with high affinity by unlabelled neutral amino acids. The inhibition constant for L-leucine in sodium medium (Ki +/- S.E.M.) was 10.7 +/- 0.72 microM (37 degrees C). The system was also strongly inhibited by L-methionine, L-glutamine and with less affinity by L-phenylalanine and L-serine. N-methyl-L-leucine, L-proline and 2-amino-2-norbornane-carboxylic acid, a bicyclic analogue of leucine, did not exert a significant effect. 6. Lysine transport through system y+L occurred at the same rate in Na+, K+ or Li+ medium and the binding of lysine to the transporter was unaffected by Na+ replacement. 7. The interaction of system y+L with neutral amino acids was dependent on the cation present in the medium. The inhibition constant for leucine and glutamine increased approximately 90- and 60-fold respectively when Na+ was replaced by K+. Li+ was shown to be a very good substitute for Na+.	eng	753	766	The Journal of physiology	468		1993	Aug		D000596/Q000494;D001693/Q000187;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005033/Q000494;D006801;D066298;D007700;D008239/Q000097;D011188/Q000097;D012964/Q000097	Amino Acids/pharmacology;Biological Transport, Active/drug effects;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Lysine/blood;Potassium/blood;Sodium/blood	Devés R;Angelo S;Chávez P	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
486	8414913	Molybdenum uptake through the anion exchanger in human erythrocytes.	Human red blood cells were incubated in the presence of Na2MoO4 and the initial rate of molybdenum uptake was measured by using inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. About 99% of molybdenum uptake was inhibited by DIDS or by SITS. DIDS-sensitive molybdenum uptake was inhibited by external chloride, bicarbonate, sulphate and phosphate in the range of concentrations previously described for anion carrier fluxes. Trace elements, previously described to be translocated by the anion carrier, i.e. copper, zinc and cadmium, slightly inhibited molybdenum uptake. Molybdenum uptake was strongly stimulated by acidification, suggesting that the monovalent HMoO4- anion species, which is formed in acidic media (pK approximately 4.1), can be more rapidly translocated than the divalent anion complex MoO4(2-), which is the predominant form at physiological pH. In conclusion, the anion carrier can catalyse rapid molybdenum movements across red cells membranes. This supports previous reports of an enterohepatic circulation of molybdenum, with red blood cells acting as molybdenum carrier between the intestine and the liver.	eng	245	249	Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology	424	3-4	1993	Aug		D017878/Q000494;D012856/Q000494;D001639/Q000097;D001693;D002712/Q000097;D002712/Q000494;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D008099/Q000378;D008982/Q000097;D013696;D014131/Q000378	4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid/pharmacology;4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/pharmacology;Bicarbonates/blood;Biological Transport, Active;Chlorides/blood;Chlorides/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Liver/metabolism;Molybdenum/blood;Temperature;Trace Elements/metabolism	Gimenez I;Garay R;Alda JO	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
487	8347174	Transport of 5-fluorouracil and uracil into human erythrocytes.	"The transport of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and uracil into human erythrocytes has been investigated under initial velocity conditions with an ""inhibitor-stop"" assay using a cold papaverine solution to terminate influx. At 37 degrees and pH 7.3, 5-FU influx was nonconcentrative; was partially inhibited by adenine, hypoxanthine, thymine, and uracil; and was insensitive to inhibition by nucleosides or inhibitors of nucleoside transport. Inhibition of the influx of 5-FU or uracil by adenine (3.0 mM) did not increase when other pyrimidines or inhibitors of nucleoside transport were combined with adenine. 5-FU and uracil exhibited similar saturable (Km approximately 4 mM, Vmax approximately 500 pmol/sec/5 microL cells) and nonsaturable (rate constant approximately 80 pmol/sec/mM/5 microL cells) components of influx. 5-FU, uracil, adenine, and hypoxanthine were competitive inhibitors of each other's influx with Ki values matching their respective Km values for influx. We conclude that 5-FU and uracil enter human erythrocytes at similar rates via both nonfacilitated diffusion and the same carrier that transports adenine and hypoxanthine."	eng	503	510	Biochemical pharmacology	46	3	1993	Aug	03	D000225/Q000378;D001692;D004912/Q000378;D005472/Q000378;D006801;D019271;D007042/Q000378;D007700;D009696/Q000378;D009705/Q000378;D010208;D014316;D014498/Q000378	Adenine/metabolism;Biological Transport;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fluorouracil/metabolism;Humans;Hypoxanthine;Hypoxanthines/metabolism;Kinetics;Nucleic Acids/metabolism;Nucleosides/metabolism;Papaverine;Tritium;Uracil/metabolism	Domin BA;Mahony WB;Zimmerman TP	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
488	8394137	Function of NAD glycohydrolase in ADP-ribose uptake from NAD by human erythrocytes.	The function of the ectoenzyme NAD glycohydrolase (NADase) in ADP-ribose uptake from extracellular NAD was studied in human erythrocytes that express relatively high NADase activity (adult erythrocytes) and erythrocytes expressing very low activity (newborn erythrocytes). The rates of ADP-ribose uptake from NAD in human erythrocytes were correlated with their NADase activities. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the rates of ADP-ribose uptake among these cells when incubated with ADP-ribose. These results indicate that ecto-NADase may have a role as supplier of ADP-ribose for its uptake into the cells and that the cleavage of NAD by NADase is necessary for the ADP-ribose uptake by human erythrocytes. From ADP-ribose uptake studies at 37 degrees C a Km of 0.7 +/- 0.05 microM and a Vmax of 2.04 +/- 0.1 pmol/min per microliter cell water was found for the uptake of [3H]ADP-ribose. The thiol-reactive reagents p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonic acid and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the uptake ADP-ribose with IC50 values of 50 +/- 4 and 750 +/- 25 mM, respectively. Since efflux of [3H]ADP-ribose was negligible, the ADP-ribose transport system appears to be unidirectional. The unidirectionality was supported by the evidence that transported ADP-ribose was rapidly degraded to AMP which is impermeable to the membrane.	eng	121	126	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1178	2	1993	Aug	18	D000246/Q000031;D000246/Q000097;D000246/Q000494;D000328;D000375/Q000097;D001692/Q000187;D001692/Q000502;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D007231;D009243/Q000097;D009244/Q000037;D009244/Q000097	Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/analogs & derivatives;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/blood;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/pharmacology;Adult;Aging/blood;Biological Transport/drug effects;Biological Transport/physiology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Infant, Newborn;NAD/blood;NAD+ Nucleosidase/antagonists & inhibitors;NAD+ Nucleosidase/blood	Kim UH;Han MK;Park BH;Kim HR;An NH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
489	8444148	The formation of methylglyoxal from triose phosphates. Investigation using a specific assay for methylglyoxal.	In Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, the rate of formation of methylglyoxal from glycerone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate was first order with respect to the triose phosphate with rates constant values of 1.94 +/- 0.02 x 10(-5) s-1 (n = 18) and 1.54 +/- 0.02 x 10(-4) s-1 (n = 18) at 37 degrees C, respectively. The rate of formation of methylglyoxal from glycerone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the presence of red blood cell lysate was not significantly different from the non-enzymatic value (P > 0.05). Methylglyoxal formation from glycerone phosphate was increased in the presence of triose phosphate isomerase but this may be due to the faster non-enzymatic formation from the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate isomerisation product. For red blood cells in vitro, the predicted non-enzymatic rate of formation of methylglyoxal from glycerone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate may account for the metabolic flux through the glyoxalase system. The reactivity of glycerone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate towards the non-enzymatic formation of methylglyoxal under physiological conditions suggests that methylglyoxal formation is unavoidable from the Embden-Meyerhof pathway.	eng	101	105	European journal of biochemistry	212	1	1993	Feb	15	D004099/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005986/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D011765/Q000378;D014305/Q000494	Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Pyruvaldehyde/metabolism;Triose-Phosphate Isomerase/pharmacology	Phillips SA;Thornalley PJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
490	8440681	The platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase from human erythrocytes. Purification and properties.	Platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine) is a biologically active phospholipid. Tissues, blood cells, and plasma contain PAF acetylhydrolases (calcium independent phospholipase A2 activities) that catalyze the hydrolysis of phospholipids containing short chain sn-2 acyl groups. They inactivate PAF and thereby determine PAF accumulation. We purified the PAF acetylhydrolase from human erythrocytes 15,600-fold. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 25,000, it behaves as a dimer during gel filtration, and it is a previously uncharacterized cytosolic esterase, as it has a unique amino-terminal sequence. The erythrocyte PAF acetylhydrolase requires the addition of sulfhydryl agents for maximal activity, is inhibited by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), NaF, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, diethylpyrocarbonate, p-bromophenacylbromide, and a number of proteases. Antibodies against the purified protein precipitate all PAF hydrolase activity from erythrocyte lysates. The erythrocyte PAF acetylhydrolase is specific for short or oxidized sn-2 acyl residues. It exhibits surface dilution kinetics, suggesting that hydrolysis occurs at lipid interfaces. This suggests that this enzyme acts in vivo as a scavenger of oxidatively fragmented phospholipids that are toxic to the cell.	eng	3857	3865	The Journal of biological chemistry	268	6	1993	Feb	25	D043203;D000595;D015153;D002478;D004591;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008969;D010084;D010741/Q000737;D010741/Q000302;D010741/Q000378;D054467;D010743/Q000378;D013379	1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase;Amino Acid Sequence;Blotting, Western;Cells, Cultured;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Molecular Sequence Data;Oxidation-Reduction;Phospholipases A/chemistry;Phospholipases A/isolation & purification;Phospholipases A/metabolism;Phospholipases A2;Phospholipids/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Stafforini DM;Rollins EN;Prescott SM;McIntyre TM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
491	8222274	Hyperphenylalaninemia and pterin metabolism in serum and erythrocytes.	The relationship between blood phenylalanine concentrations and serum and erythrocyte biopterin and neopterin concentrations was investigated in 20 phenylketonuric patients with different dietary compliance. At serum phenylalanine concentrations ranging from 43 to 1004 mumol/l, a good correlation was found with serum biopterin (r = 0.76, P < 0.001) and with red blood cell biopterin (r = 0.62, P < 0.001). A similar correlation was found between serum neopterin and phenylalanine (r = 0.60, P < 0.001). The correlation between red blood cell neopterin and serum phenylalanine was less evident, however (r = 0.47, P < 0.005). After oral loading with phenylalanine (100 mg/kg body weight), serum and red blood cell biopterin concentrations increased in patients with classical phenylketonuria as well as in one patient with dihydropteridine reductase deficiency in response to the induced acute hyperphenylalaninemia. One patient suffering from 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase deficiency was loaded orally with tetrahydrobiopterin (20 mg/kg body weight). The kinetics of administered cofactor confirmed its rapid absorption, with early increase of serum concentrations followed by its transport into the red blood cells. The half-life of biopterin was approximately 7 h in serum and 15 h in red blood cells. Because both values are less than the half-life of phenylalanine (20-30 h) in serum, biopterin measurement offers no advantage in monitoring dietary control in hyperphenylalaninemic patients.	eng	63	71	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	216	1-2	1993	Jul	16	D000429/Q000172;D001708/Q000031;D001708/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006207;D006801;D007700;D008297;D019798;D010649/Q000097;D010661/Q000097;D010661/Q000201;D019761;D011622/Q000097	Alcohol Oxidoreductases/deficiency;Biopterins/analogs & derivatives;Biopterins/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Half-Life;Humans;Kinetics;Male;Neopterin;Phenylalanine/blood;Phenylketonurias/blood;Phenylketonurias/enzymology;Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases;Pterins/blood	Ponzone A;Guardamagna O;Spada M;Ponzone R;Sartore M;Kierat L;Heizmann CW;Blau N	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify Rh-related cDNAs from erythroid cells cultured by the selective two-phase liquid culture system for human erythroid progenitors in peripheral blood. Direct sequencing based on PCR presents heterozygous bands. Two Rh polypeptide cDNAs have been isolated from the PCR products and tentatively designated RhPI cDNA and RhPII cDNA. Both cDNA clones have an open reading frame composed of 1251 nucleotides. The RhPI cDNA clone shows a single nucleotide substitution with no amino acid substitution compared with the published sequence. The RhPII cDNA clone, on the other hand, differs from the above by 41 nucleotide substitutions with the open reading frame, resulting in 31 amino acid substitutions.	eng	157	162	Human genetics	91	2	1993	Mar		D000595;D001483;D001798/Q000737;D001798/Q000235;D002478;D003001;D015672;D006801;D008969;D010455/Q000737;D010455/Q000235;D012333/Q000032;D012204/Q000737;D012204/Q000235;D017422	Amino Acid Sequence;Base Sequence;Blood Proteins/chemistry;Blood Proteins/genetics;Cells, Cultured;Cloning, Molecular;Erythroid Precursor Cells;Humans;Molecular Sequence Data;Peptides/chemistry;Peptides/genetics;RNA, Messenger/analysis;Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/chemistry;Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/genetics;Sequence Analysis, DNA	Kajii E;Umenishi F;Iwamoto S;Ikemoto S	Journal, Articles							Erythro;erythro	True
494	8444178	Glycerophosphocholine release in human erythrocytes. 1H spin-echo and 31P-NMR evidence for lysophospholipase.	The direct techniques of 1H spin-echo and 31P-NMR spectroscopy made it possible to monitor the release of glycerophosphocholine from lysophosphatidylcholine in lysates from human red blood cells. Thus, the existence of a lysophospholipase in human erythrocytes was confirmed using a new more direct method. No evidence for a phospholipase A2 activity in the haemolysates was found with the same approach; since this enzyme is present in leukocytes, the absence of activity helped verify the purity of the erythrocyte preparation. The lysophospholipase may constitute, with the earlier described glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase activity, a metabolic unit for the removal of haemolytic lysophosphatidylcholine which is formed in the erythrocyte membranes as well as taken up from the plasma.	eng	411	416	European journal of biochemistry	212	2	1993	Mar	01	D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D005997/Q000378;D006801;D008244/Q000378;D008245/Q000097;D008245/Q000502;D009682;D010741/Q000378;D054467	Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycerylphosphorylcholine/metabolism;Humans;Lysophosphatidylcholines/metabolism;Lysophospholipase/blood;Lysophospholipase/physiology;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Phospholipases A/metabolism;Phospholipases A2	Selle H;Chapman BE;Kuchel PW	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
495	8461019	Production and hydrolysis of cyclic ADP-ribose at the outer surface of human erythrocytes.	Hemoglobin-free membranes from human erythrocytes are able to convert beta-NAD+ to cyclic ADP-ribose, a calcium mobilizer as potent as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Identification of cyclic ADP-ribose was based on HPLC analyses and its Ca(2+)-mobilizing activity on sea urchin egg microsomes. Erythrocyte membranes also hydrolyze cyclic ADP-ribose to ADP-ribose. By comparing the cyclic ADP-ribose-synthesizing and -hydrolyzing activities on unsealed and right-side-out resealed ghosts, it can be concluded that both are localized at the extracellular side of the membrane. This is confirmed by the demonstration of both enzyme activities on the surface of intact human red cells. Identification of the two enzymes involved in cyclic ADP-ribose metabolism might suggest some physiological role of this nucleotide in red cells.	eng	639	645	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	191	2	1993	Mar	15	D036541;D051997;D000246/Q000031;D000246/Q000096;D000246/Q000378;D000818;D015703;D000943/Q000378;D002118/Q000378;D002478;D036563;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D006868;D008562;D008861/Q000378;D009699/Q000378;D009243/Q000378;D010063;D012617	ADP-ribosyl Cyclase;ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/analogs & derivatives;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/biosynthesis;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Animals;Antigens, CD;Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism;Calcium/metabolism;Cells, Cultured;Cyclic ADP-Ribose;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Hydrolysis;Membrane Glycoproteins;Microsomes/metabolism;N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/metabolism;NAD/metabolism;Ovum;Sea Urchins	Lee HC;Zocchi E;Guida L;Franco L;Benatti U;De Flora A	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
496	8384492	Characterization of phosphoinositide kinases in normal and sickle anaemia red cells.	PtdIns and PtdInsP kinases from normal erythrocyte (AA) membranes and sickle cell anaemia erythrocyte (SS) membranes have been characterized. PtdIns kinase was studied in native membranes under conditions in which PtdInsP kinase and PtdInsP phosphatase do not express any activity. Kinetic analysis of the AA and SS PtdIns kinases indicate similar Km values for PtdIns and ATP but higher Vmax values for SS PtdIns kinase. PtdInsP kinase was partially purified from erythrocyte ghosts by NaCl extraction. The kinetic parameters of PtdInsP kinase determined under these conditions were similar in AA and SS NaCl extracts. These data suggest the presence of some effector of PtdIns kinase in SS cell membranes, resulting in a greater activity of the enzyme. This leads consequently, to increase the PtdIns4P pool and to activate PtdInsP kinase, in agreement with our previous observations of a greater [32P]Pi incorporation in both polyphosphoinositides in SS cells relatively to AA cells.	eng	90	96	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1181	1	1993	Mar	24	D019870;D000241/Q000494;D000255/Q000378;D000755/Q000201;D002478;D004910/Q000201;D004913/Q000201;D006493/Q000494;D006801;D007700;D008274/Q000494;D010716/Q000378;D010770/Q000378;D017853;D013096/Q000494	1-Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase;Adenosine/pharmacology;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Anemia, Sickle Cell/enzymology;Cells, Cultured;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes, Abnormal/enzymology;Heparin/pharmacology;Humans;Kinetics;Magnesium/pharmacology;Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism;Phosphotransferases/metabolism;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor);Spermine/pharmacology	Rhoda-Hardy-Dessources MD;de Neef RS;Mérault G;Giraud F	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte;Erythrocyte;red cell	True

498	8388377	Vitamin E recycling in human erythrocyte membranes.	Vitamin E, the major lipid chain-breaking antioxidant in erythrocyte membranes, is present in low concentration, suggesting that mechanisms should exist to protect against its loss. Enzymatic pathways for the recycling of vitamin E from its tocopheroxyl radical have been observed previously in inner membranes of mitochondria and microsomes. These pathways use electron transport enzymes and their substrates to regenerate vitamin E. Erythrocyte membranes also contain significant NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity, as well as cytochrome b5, the function of which is not yet known. Using an enzymatic oxidation system composed of lipoxygenase and arachidonic acid, free radicals were produced in human erythrocyte membranes, and their reaction with chromanols was followed by ESR and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Since the endogenous vitamin E content of the membranes is very low, we used a vitamin E homologue lacking the hydrocarbon chain (2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-hydroxychromane) as a probe molecule for ESR measurements. However, parallel HPLC determinations of lipid hydroperoxides and of endogenous vitamin E confirmed the results obtained by ESR. It was found that protection against the loss of vitamin E can be provided either by NADH-cytochrome b5-dependent enzymatic recycling or by a nonenzymatic pathway involving ascorbate and dihydrolipoic acid.	eng	10906	10913	The Journal of biological chemistry	268	15	1993	May	25	D016718/Q000097;D002851;D015786/Q000097;D004578;D004910/Q000378;D005609/Q000097;D006801;D007700;D015227;D008084/Q000097;D008954;D009243/Q000097;D009245/Q000097;D010084;D014810/Q000097	Arachidonic Acid/blood;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cytochromes b5/blood;Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Free Radicals/blood;Humans;Kinetics;Lipid Peroxidation;Lipoxygenase/blood;Models, Biological;NAD/blood;NADH Dehydrogenase/blood;Oxidation-Reduction;Vitamin E/blood	Constantinescu A;Han D;Packer L	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

500	8109730	A liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of alpha-tocopherol and tocopherolquinone in human red blood cells and other biological samples where tocopherol is easily oxidized during sample treatment.	A liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of alpha-tocopherol and tocopherolquinone in human red blood cells is described. Tocopherols in the red cell membrane are very susceptible to oxidation during sample processing. Red cell samples are saponified in the presence of a mixture of butylated hydroxytoluene, ascorbic acid, and pyrogallol and then extracted with hexane. The tocopherol compounds are separated on a C-18 column using a mobile phase containing 12% acetonitrile, 83% methanol, and 5% buffer (NaH2PO4.H2O, 7.5 mM final concentration) and are detected electrochemically. The mixture of antioxidants is essential to avoid loss of the tocopherol compounds during processing of samples. The use of acetonitrile in the mobile phase results in the separation of tocopherolquinone from delta-tocopherol. The proposed method may be generally suitable for the analysis of biological samples where tocopherols are especially vulnerable to oxidation. The levels of tocopherolquinone and delta-tocopherol in normal red cells are quite small (less than 1% of alpha-tocopherol). The ratio of tocopherol and tocopherolquinone concentrations might serve as a useful index of the redox status of red cell membranes, particularly under in vitro conditions.	eng	426	430	Analytical biochemistry	214	2	1993	Nov	01	D001681;D002853;D004563;D004912/Q000737;D006801;D008297;D010084;D012680;D013048/Q000379;D014810/Q000031;D014810/Q000097	Biological Assay;Chromatography, Liquid;Electrochemistry;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Humans;Male;Oxidation-Reduction;Sensitivity and Specificity;Specimen Handling/methods;Vitamin E/analogs & derivatives;Vitamin E/blood	Vatassery GT;Smith WE;Quach HT	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell;Red cell	True
501	8239658	Human erythrocyte casein kinase II: characterization and phosphorylation of membrane cytoskeletal proteins.	Casein kinase II activities were purified from human erythrocyte membrane and cytosolic fractions to apparent homogeneity. The kinases isolated from the membrane and cytosolic fractions exhibited the same subunit composition and the ability to utilize ATP and GTP as phosphoryl donors. Antibodies against the alpha and alpha' subunits of human casein kinase II cross reacted with the corresponding subunits of both erythrocyte casein kinases. Spermine, spermidine, putrescine, and polylysine stimulated to varying degrees the activities of erythrocyte casein kinase II, whereas heparin inhibited the kinase activities. Both kinases were found to catalyze the phosphorylation of several erythrocyte membrane cytoskeletal proteins, including spectrin, ankyrin, adducin, protein 4.1, and protein 4.9. Unlike casein kinase I, casein kinase II did not phosphorylate band 3 appreciably. A preliminary estimate indicates that both human erythrocyte membrane and cytosolic casein kinase II catalyze the incorporation of approximately 1.2 and 3.5 moles of phosphate into each mole of spectrin and ankyrin, respectively. An analysis of the phosphopeptide maps of ankyrin indicates that both membrane and cytosolic kinases phosphorylate the same domains within ankyrin.

The three ectoenzyme activities, NAD+ glycohydrolase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase were purified to homogeneity from solubilized human erythrocyte membranes. The purification procedure involved three sequential chromatography steps on hydroxylapatite, immobilized Cu++ and immobilized anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody resins. The final step yielded a single 46 kDa protein displaying all three enzymatic activities. Since the protein bound specifically to the anti-CD38 resin, it was immunologically identified as CD38, a 46 kDa surface antigen involved in activation and proliferation of lymphocyte populations.	eng	1459	1465	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	196	3	1993	Nov	15	D036541;D051997;D015703/Q000097;D015703/Q000302;D000943/Q000097;D000943/Q000302;D002712/Q000494;D002845;D003300/Q000494;D017886;D004591;D004910/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008562;D008970;D009699/Q000097;D009699/Q000302;D009244/Q000097;D009244/Q000302;D017967/Q000494	ADP-ribosyl Cyclase;ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1;Antigens, CD/blood;Antigens, CD/isolation & purification;Antigens, Differentiation/blood;Antigens, Differentiation/isolation & purification;Chlorides/pharmacology;Chromatography;Copper/pharmacology;Durapatite;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Membrane Glycoproteins;Molecular Weight;N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/blood;N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/isolation & purification;NAD+ Nucleosidase/blood;NAD+ Nucleosidase/isolation & purification;Zinc Compounds/pharmacology	Zocchi E;Franco L;Guida L;Benatti U;Bargellesi A;Malavasi F;Lee HC;De Flora A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
503	8216206	Free ADP-ribose in human erythrocytes: pathways of intra-erythrocytic conversion and non-enzymic binding to membrane proteins.	We have previously identified free ADP-ribose (ADPR) as a normal metabolite in mature human erythrocytes. In this study the metabolic transformations of ADPR were investigated in both supernatants from erythrocyte lysates and intact erythrocytes, loaded with ADPR by means of a procedure involving hypotonic haemolysis and isotonic resealing. In both experimental systems, the main pathway was a dinucleotide pyrophosphatase-catalysed hydrolysis to yield AMP, which was readily converted into the adenylic and inosinic nucleotide pools. To a lesser extent, ADPR underwent conversion into a compound that was identified as ADP-ribulose (ADPRu), on the basis of m.s., n.m.r. spectroscopy and enzymic analysis. ADPRu was also susceptible to degradation by the dinucleotide pyrophosphatase, which was partially purified from erythrocyte lysates and characterized with respect to its substrate specificity. Isomerization of ADPR to ADPRu was markedly enhanced by ATP. Incubation of unsealed haemoglobin-free erythrocyte membranes with labelled ADPR did not cause any transformation of this nucleotide and resulted in its trichloroacetic acid- and formic acid-resistant binding to a number of membrane cytoskeletal proteins. These proteins include spectrin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Ga3PDH), three proteins of molecular masses 98, 79 and 72 kDa, which apparently comigrate with bands 3, 4.1 and 4.2 respectively, and two additional proteins of molecular masses 58 and 41 kDa. Acid-resistant binding of ADPR, as well as of NAD+, to Ga3PDH was confirmed for the enzyme purified from human erythrocytes.	eng	121	130	The Biochemical journal	295 ( Pt 1)	Pt 1	1993	Oct	01	D000227/Q000378;D000246/Q000031;D000246/Q000378;D019747;D002238/Q000378;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005987/Q000378;D006801;D007292/Q000378;D007661/Q000378;D008565/Q000378;D008954;D011755/Q000378;D013379	Adenine Nucleotides/metabolism;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/analogs & derivatives;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Aldose-Ketose Isomerases;Carbohydrate Epimerases/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/metabolism;Humans;Inosine Nucleotides/metabolism;Ketoses/metabolism;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Models, Biological;Pyrophosphatases/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Zocchi E;Guida L;Franco L;Silvestro L;Guerrini M;Benatti U;De Flora A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
504	8373360	Human thimet oligopeptidase.	We have purified human thimet oligopeptidase to homogeneity from erythrocytes, and compared it with the enzyme from rat testis and chicken liver. An antiserum raised against rat thimet oligopeptidase also recognized the human and chicken enzymes, suggesting that the structure of the enzyme has been strongly conserved in evolution. Consistent with this, the properties of the human enzyme were very similar to those for the other species. Thus human thimet oligopeptidase also is a thiol-dependent metallo-oligopeptidase with M(r) about 75,000. Specificity for cleavage of a number of peptides was indistinguishable from that of the rat enzyme, but Ki values for the four potent reversible inhibitors tested were lower. In discussing the results, we consider the determinants of the complex substrate specificity of thimet oligopeptidase. We question whether substrates containing more than 17 amino acid residues are cleaved, as has been suggested. We also point out that the favourable location of a proline residue and a free C-terminus in the substrate may be as important as the hydrophobic residues in the P2, P1 and P3' positions that have been emphasized in the past.	eng	451	457	The Biochemical journal	294 ( Pt 2)	Pt 2	1993	Sep	01	D000595;D000818;D002645;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008099/Q000201;D008297;D008666/Q000097;D008666/Q000737;D008670/Q000494;D008969;D008970;D009842/Q000737;D009842/Q000378;D051381;D013045;D013379;D013438/Q000494	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Chickens;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Liver/enzymology;Male;Metalloendopeptidases/blood;Metalloendopeptidases/chemistry;Metals/pharmacology;Molecular Sequence Data;Molecular Weight;Oligopeptides/chemistry;Oligopeptides/metabolism;Rats;Species Specificity;Substrate Specificity;Sulfhydryl Compounds/pharmacology	Dando PM;Brown MA;Barrett AJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
505	8404896	Studies on O-glycans of Plasmodium-falciparum-infected human erythrocytes. Evidence for O-GlcNAc and O-GlcNAc-transferase in malaria parasites.	O-Glycosylation is the major form of protein glycosylation in human erythrocytes infected with the asexual intraerythrocytic stage of the malaria parasite. Plasmodium falciparum. This study compares aspects of O-glycosylation in P. falciparum-infected and uninfected erythrocytes. Non-labeled and metabolically glucosamine-labeled O-glycans were obtained from the protein fraction of infected or uninfected erythrocytes by beta elimination. Additional label was introduced by reduction with sodium borohydride, or by the attachment of radioactive Gal to peripheral GlcNAc using galactosyltransferase. 2-4-times more labeled O-glycans were obtained from infected erythrocytes compared to the same number of uninfected ones, consistent with additional biosynthesis by the parasite. Our analysis of these O-glycans showed no significant qualitative divergence between the O-glycans of the infected and those of the uninfected red cell. According to preliminary alditol analyses, the O-glycans of P. falciparum-infected red cells do not contain GalNAc at their reducing terminus. Moreover, GalNAc was not synthesized by P. falciparum from either Glc, Gal, GlcN or GalN. At least one O-glycan found in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes contains GlcNAc at its reducing terminus. Gel-filtration results had suggested the presence of O-GlcNAc on proteins in the infected erythrocyte. Probing with a synthetic pentapeptide, we could show that P. falciparum expresses its own O-GlcNAc transferase during intraerythrocytic development. Using this peptide, the enzyme was characterized to some degree. The localization and function of O-GlcNAc in P. falciparum remains to be elucidated.	eng	779	788	European journal of biochemistry	216	3	1993	Sep	15	D000117/Q000378;D000595;D000818;D002478;D002845;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000469;D006801;D016778/Q000097;D016778/Q000201;D008969;D017351/Q000378;D010455/Q000737;D010963/Q000201;D010963/Q000378;D011134/Q000097;D011134/Q000737	Acetylglucosamine/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Cells, Cultured;Chromatography;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Humans;Malaria, Falciparum/blood;Malaria, Falciparum/enzymology;Molecular Sequence Data;N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/metabolism;Peptides/chemistry;Plasmodium falciparum/enzymology;Plasmodium falciparum/metabolism;Polysaccharides/blood;Polysaccharides/chemistry	Dieckmann-Schuppert A;Bause E;Schwarz RT	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
506	7707690	Further studies on erythrocyte thiamin transport and phosphorylation in seven patients with thiamin-responsive megaloblastic anaemia.	Erythrocyte thiamin metabolism and transport were investigated in 7 patients from Brazil, Israel and Italy suffering from thiamin-responsive megaloblastic anaemia (TRMA) associated with diabetes mellitus and sensorineural deafness. All patients discontinued thiamin therapy for 4-7 days before the investigation. TRMA patients showed invariably reduced total thiamin levels in erythrocytes (percentage reduction compared with healthy controls, -46.8 +/- 3%; mean +/- SEM). The proportions of individual thiamin compounds, expressed as a percentage of total thiamin content, were within the normal range, whereas their absolute amounts were significantly decreased in the following order: thiamin monophosphate > thiamin pyrophosphate > thiamin. Thiamin pyrophosphokinase activity was also reduced as compared with controls (mean reduction +/- SEM, -25.9 +/- 1%). The saturable, specific component of thiamin uptake, which normally prevails at physiological concentrations of thiamin (< 2 mumol/L), was absent in erythrocytes obtained from TRMA patients, while the non-saturable (diffusive) component of uptake was normally present. These results confirm observations made previously in two patients and demonstrate that TRMA is consistently associated with a state of thiamin deficiency, which is presumably secondary to reduced thiamin cellular transport and absorption (caused by lack of a membrane-specific carrier), and to impaired intracellular pyrophosphorylation.	eng	667	677	Journal of inherited metabolic disease	17	6	1994			D000749/Q000097;D001692;D002648;D002675;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D007223;D010766;D013831/Q000097;D013831/Q000627	Anemia, Megaloblastic/blood;Biological Transport;Child;Child, Preschool;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Infant;Phosphorylation;Thiamine/blood;Thiamine/therapeutic use	Rindi G;Patrini C;Laforenza U;Mandel H;Berant M;Viana MB;Poggi V;Zarra AN	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
507	8070312	Carbonyl reductase activity for acetohexamide in human erythrocytes.	Acetohexamide is an oral antidiabetic agent and is metabolized by the reductive conversion of the acetoxy group to a secondary alcohol metabolite. In vivo, many drugs are metabolized by reductase enzymes; however, the characteristics of the enzymes that reduce carbonyl compounds need to be clarified. We tested whether reductase activity for acetohexamide can be found in human erythrocytes. Enzyme activity was monitored by formation of hydroxyhexamide using HPLC methods. In human erythrocytes, reductase activity (6.10 +/- 1.20 nmol/min/g hemoglobin) (mean +/- SD) was indeed observed, when 0.5 mM acetohexamide was used as a substrate. KM values and Vmax at the physiologically important pH 7.4 were 0.70 +/- 0.13 mM and 9.19 +/- 0.88 nmol/min/g hemoglobin, respectively. Separation of protein by gel filtration gave one major peak fraction with reductase activity whose molecular weight was estimated to be 31,000. Known substrates of carbonyl reductase such as menadione, daunorubicin, and ethacrynic acid inhibited the acetohexamide reduction. The acetohexamide reductase in erythrocyte showed characteristics of carbonyl reductase. Furthermore, acetohexamide reductase activity in erythrocyte was approximately 30% activity of that of human liver (0.17 +/- 0.05 nmol/min/mg cytosolic protein). The pattern of inhibitors in human liver was essentially the same as that in erythrocytes. It is plausible that the activity in erythrocytes may predict the activity in the liver. It was concluded that carbonyl reductase in human erythrocyte plays an important role in acetohexamide metabolism.	eng	367	370	Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals	22	3	1994			D000092/Q000097;D000328;D000429/Q000037;D000429/Q000097;D000429/Q000378;D000449;D000074408;D002478;D003630/Q000494;D004912/Q000201;D004976/Q000494;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008099/Q000201;D008297;D009249/Q000097;D010084;D014812/Q000494	Acetohexamide/blood;Adult;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/blood;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Aldehyde Reductase;Aldo-Keto Reductases;Cells, Cultured;Daunorubicin/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Ethacrynic Acid/pharmacology;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Liver/enzymology;Male;NADP/blood;Oxidation-Reduction;Vitamin K/pharmacology	Kishimoto M;Kawamori R;Kamada T;Inaba T	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
508	7915653	Amino acid transport by human erythrocyte membranes.	The human erythrocyte plasma membrane is permeable to several free amino acids usually present in the bloodstream. Seven distinct routes of entry have been described which represent both secondary active transport and facilitated diffusion (passive transport). Additionally, certain amino acids can enter the cell by simple diffusion, at least to a limited extent. The function of most of these transport systems is unclear, although it has been suggested that the cell can take up certain amino acids and carry them to various parts of the body. In the case of glutamine, cysteine, and glycine, however, it is believed that the biosynthesis of the tripeptide glutathione is the primary reason for their uptake into the cell. Much of the amino acid transport probably has no function in mature red cells, but might be a remnant of the immature cell's needs. This review discusses the various amino acid transport systems known to be present in the red cell plasma membrane.	eng	471	478	Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

509	8141248	Identification of a sorbitol permease in human erythrocytes.	Sorbitol, a polyol derived from glucose by the enzyme, aldose reductase, is a common organic solute in many cells. It plays a role in the osmotic regulation of epithelial cells and in the pathology of uncontrolled diabetes. To learn more about sorbitol transport, we measured D-[14C]sorbitol influx in human erythrocytes. Sorbitol influx at 37 degrees C was a linear function of sorbitol concentration over the range of 0.05-100 mM. The activation energy for sorbitol influx was 10.0 kcal/mol, and the Q10 over the range 10-50 degrees C was 1.8, higher than predicted for diffusion through an aqueous pore. Glucose transport inhibitors either had no effect (1 mM phloridzin) or minimally inhibited (approximately 35% inhibition by 10 microM cytochalasin B or 250 microM phloretin) sorbitol influx. Influx was stimulated twofold by 0.5 mM p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, an inhibitor of glucose transport, and this was reversed by 2 mM dithiothreitol. Sorbitol influx was neither Na dependent nor sensitive to changes in cell volume. Glucose, fructose, mannitol, myo-inositol, and gluconate, at four- to fivefold molar excesses over sorbitol, did not inhibit its influx. We conclude that there is a specific sorbitol transport pathway in human erythrocytes similar to the sorbitol permease in renal epithelial cells.	eng	C343	C350	The American journal of physiology	266	2 Pt 1	1994	Feb		D000818;D002241/Q000037;D002463;D004285;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D026901/Q000097;D009994;D009995;D011817;D012756;D012964/Q000494;D013012/Q000378;D013012/Q000493;D013438/Q000494;D013696;D013997	Animals;Carbohydrates/antagonists & inhibitors;Cell Membrane Permeability;Dogs;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Membrane Transport Proteins/blood;Osmolar Concentration;Osmosis;Rabbits;Sheep;Sodium/pharmacology;Sorbitol/metabolism;Sorbitol/pharmacokinetics;Sulfhydryl Compounds/pharmacology;Temperature;Time Factors	Kracke GR;Preston GG;Stanley TH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

511	8300565	Exposure of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of human red blood cells. Relationship to cell density, cell age, and clearance by mononuclear cells.	Human red blood cells (RBC) were separated by density on self-forming Percoll gradients into five distinct populations. The transbilayer movement and equilibrium distribution of 1-oleoyl-2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4- yl)aminocaproyl)phosphatidylserine (NBD-PS) was slower in dense cells and equilibrated in the inner leaflet of these cells to a lesser degree than in light cells. Conversely, the outward movement of the lipid was slower in light cells. Assessment of endogenous PS in the cells' outer leaflet by the prothrombinase activity of externalized PS revealed an increase in its presence at the cell surface with increasing cell density. The presence of PS on the cell surface directly correlated with the propensity of the RBC to bound by autologous monocytes. To determine whether increased cell density is associated with increased cell age, the in vivo clearance of density-separated murine RBC was monitored in syngeneic mice. The T1/2 of circulation of light cells was about twice that of dense cells. The majority of the cleared cells localized in the spleen. Studies carried out in antibody-deficient SCID mice indicated that RBC were cleared via a mechanism that was independent of antibody. These data suggest that cell age is related to cell density and that cells of increasing age and density display higher amounts of PS in their outer leaflet.	eng	2399	2404	The Journal of biological chemistry	269	4	1994	Jan	28	D009327/Q000031;D009327/Q000097;D000818;D001692;D002469;D002478;D002499;D004905;D004910/Q000737;D004910/Q000502;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000502;D006801;D066298;D008563/Q000032;D008563/Q000097;D051379;D008810;D016513;D009000/Q000166;D009000/Q000502;D010713/Q000097;D010718/Q000032;D010718/Q000097;D013925/Q000378	4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan/analogs & derivatives;4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan/blood;Animals;Biological Transport;Cell Separation;Cells, Cultured;Centrifugation, Density Gradient;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocyte Membrane/chemistry;Erythrocyte Membrane/physiology;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/physiology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Membrane Lipids/analysis;Membrane Lipids/blood;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, SCID;Monocytes/cytology;Monocytes/physiology;Phosphatidylcholines/blood;Phosphatidylserines/analysis;Phosphatidylserines/blood;Thromboplastin/metabolism	Connor J;Pak CC;Schroit AJ	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
512	8044895	Regulation of intracellular creatine in erythrocytes and myoblasts: influence of uraemia and inhibition of Na,K-ATPase.	The regulation of intracellular creatine concentration in mammalian cells is poorly understood, but is thought to depend upon active sodium-linked uptake of creatine from extracellular fluid. In normal human erythrocytes, creatine influx into washed cells was inhibited by 40 per cent in the absence of extracellular sodium. In washed cells from uraemic patients, sodium-independent creatine influx was normal, whereas the sodium-dependent component of creatine influx was 3.3 times higher than normal, possibly reflecting the reduced mean age of uraemic erythrocytes. In spite of this, the intracellular creatine concentration was no higher than normal in uraemic erythrocytes, implying that some factor in uraemic plasma in vivo inhibits sodium-dependent creatine influx. Both in normal and uraemic erythrocytes, the creatine concentration was 10 times that in plasma, and the concentration in the cells showed no detectable dependence on that in plasma, suggesting that the intracellular creatine concentration is controlled by an active saturable process. Active sodium-dependent accumulation of creatine was also demonstrated in L6 rat myoblasts and was inhibited when transport was measured in the presence of 10(-4) M ouabain or digoxin, implying that uptake was driven by the transmembrane sodium gradient. However, when creatine influx was measured immediately after ouabain or digoxin had been washed away, it was higher than in control cells, suggesting that Na,K-ATPase and/or sodium-linked creatine transport are up-regulated when treated with inhibitors of Na,K-ATPase.	eng	99	106	Cell biochemistry and function	12	2	1994	Jun		D000328;D000368;D000818;D001692;D003401/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D008297;D008875;D009132/Q000201;D009132/Q000378;D051381;D000254/Q000037;D000254/Q000378;D013234/Q000201;D013234/Q000378;D014511/Q000378	Adult;Aged;Animals;Biological Transport;Creatine/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Muscles/enzymology;Muscles/metabolism;Rats;Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/antagonists & inhibitors;Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/metabolism;Stem Cells/enzymology;Stem Cells/metabolism;Uremia/metabolism	Bennett SE;Bevington A;Walls J	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
513	8019414	The primary structure and properties of thioltransferase (glutaredoxin) from human red blood cells.	Thioltransferase (glutaredoxin) was purified from human red blood cells essentially as described previously (Mieyal JJ et al., 1991a, Biochemistry 30:6088-6097). The primary sequence of the HPLC-pure enzyme was determined by tandem mass spectrometry and found to represent a 105-amino acid protein of molecular weight 11,688 Da. The physicochemical and catalytic properties of this enzyme are common to the group of proteins called glutaredoxins among the family of thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases that also includes thioredoxin and protein disulfide isomerase. Although this human red blood cell glutaredoxin (hRBC Grx) is highly homologous to the 3 other mammalian Grx proteins whose sequences are known (calf thymus, rabbit bone marrow, and pig liver), there are a number of significant differences. Most notably an additional cysteine residue (Cys-7) occurs near the N-terminus of the human enzyme in place of a serine residue in the other proteins. In addition, residue 51 of hRBC Grx displayed a mixture of Asp and Asn. This result is consistent with isoelectric focusing analysis, which revealed 2 distinct bands for either the oxidized or reduced forms of the protein. Because the enzyme was prepared from blood combined from a number of individual donors, it is not clear whether this Asp/Asn ambiguity represents inter-individual variation, gene duplication, or a deamidation artifact of purification.	eng	428	434	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society	3	3	1994	Mar		D000595;D000818;D004912/Q000201;D054477;D006801;D008322;D013058;D008969;D015394;D008970;D010088/Q000097;D010088/Q000737;D010088/Q000235;D011490;D017386	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glutaredoxins;Humans;Mammals;Mass Spectrometry;Molecular Sequence Data;Molecular Structure;Molecular Weight;Oxidoreductases/blood;Oxidoreductases/chemistry;Oxidoreductases/genetics;Protein Disulfide Reductase (Glutathione);Sequence Homology, Amino Acid	Papov VV;Gravina SA;Mieyal JJ;Biemann K	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
514	8205249	Determination of thiamine and its phosphate esters in human erythrocytes by high-performance liquid chromatography with isocratic elution.	A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of thiamine and its phosphate esters in human erythrocytes, using postcolumn derivatization, is presented. The sample preparation and the choice of the analytical column avoid the use of an elution gradient. The four thiamine compounds (thiamine and thiamine monophosphate, diphosphate and triphosphate) are eluted within less than 15 min with a detection limit of ca. 20 fmol. The reproducibility and accuracy of the assay are satisfactory. Normal physiological red blood cell concentrations of the four thiamine compounds are included.	eng	217	220	Journal of chromatography.

515	8125926	Kinetic analysis and chemical modification of vitamin B6 phosphatase from human erythrocytes.	The specificity and active site properties of vitamin B6 phosphatase purified from human erythrocytes were studied by kinetic analyses with vitamin B6 compounds and derivatives and chemical modification with group-specific reagents. The kinetic constants for pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), 4-pyridoxic acid phosphate, pyridoxine phosphate, and pyridoxamine phosphate were determined from pH 5 to 9. The values of Vmax/Km and pKm were highest for PLP and 4-pyridoxic acid phosphate and lowest for pyridoxamine phosphate. Vmax/Km and pKm for the four substrates were maximum between pH 6 and 8. Ionizable groups with pKa values about 6 and 8 affected substrate binding to the enzyme. Vmax values for all the substrates gradually decreased with increasing pH. The enzyme also catalyzed the dephosphorylation of 4'-secondary amine derivatives of vitamin B6-phosphate. The phosphatase had greatest catalytic efficiency with substrates that contained a negatively charged group on the 4'-position of the pyridine ring. It is concluded that there are one or two positively charged groups at the active site of the enzyme that interact with the substrate's phosphate ester and 4'-substituent. The phosphatase was inactivated by phenylglyoxal, and PLP protected the enzyme against this inactivation. Phenylglyoxal did not modify Lys or Cys residues or an alpha-amino group since the enzyme's NH2 terminus is blocked, and it did not affect the quaternary structure of the phosphatase. The enzyme was inactivated by the incorporation of 1 mol of phenylglyoxal/subunit. Diethylpyrocarbonate inactivated the enzyme by reacting with a group with a pKa of 6.7, and pyridoxine phosphate protected the enzyme against this inactivation. These data suggest that Arg and His residues are at or near the active site and may play roles in substrate binding and/or catalysis.	eng	7163	7168	The Journal of biological chemistry	269	10	1994	Mar	11	D004047;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D010658;D010744/Q000378;D013379;D013774	Diethyl Pyrocarbonate;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Phenylglyoxal;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism;Substrate Specificity;Tetranitromethane	Gao GJ;Fonda ML	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
516	7707348	Different arachidonate and palmitate binding capacities of the human red cell membrane.	Human red cell membrane bindings of arachidonate and palmitate at pH 7.3 are investigated at temperatures between 0 and 38 degrees C by equilibrating ghosts with the long-chain fatty acids bound to bovine serum albumin in molar ratios (v) within the physiological range (< 1.7). Linearized relations of ghost uptakes and fatty acid monomer concentrations in buffer provide estimates of the binding capacities and corresponding equilibrium dissociation constants (Kdm). The temperature-independent arachidonate binding capacity, 5.5 +/- 0.5 nmol g-1 packed ghosts, is approximately fivefold smaller than that of palmitate, 26.6 +/- 2.0 nmol g-1. While Kdm of arachidonate binding 5.1 +/- 0.5 nM is temperature independent, Kdm of palmitate increases with temperature from 3.7 nM at 0 degrees C to 12.7 nM at 38 degrees C. The large difference in binding capacities suggests the presence of at least two different fatty acid binding domains in human red cell membranes.	eng	113	116	The Journal of membrane biology	142	1	1994	Oct		D000818;D016718/Q000378;D002352/Q000378;D002417;D004910/Q000378;D000071438;D050556;D006801;D006863;D009363;D019308;D010169/Q000378;D011485;D012710/Q000378;D013696;D025521	Animals;Arachidonic Acid/metabolism;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cattle;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Fatty Acid-Binding Protein 7;Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Neoplasm Proteins;Palmitic Acid;Palmitic Acids/metabolism;Protein Binding;Serum Albumin, Bovine/metabolism;Temperature;Tumor Suppressor Proteins	Bojesen IN;Bojesen E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True
517	7847607	Studies of the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde by oxyhemoglobin using fluorigenic high-performance liquid chromatography.	We noted a rise in acetaldehyde levels in clinical samples of venous whole blood containing ethanol that did not occur in samples from teetotalers. Experiments were performed to define the mechanism involved in acetaldehyde production. The addition of 0.10% ethanol to whole blood produced an immediate increase in acetaldehyde due to acetaldehyde in the stock solution followed by a subsequent increase that became statistically significant by 48 hr. Separation of blood into components documented that the increase in acetaldehyde was associated with the red cell but not plasma fraction. Incubation of isolated hemoglobin with ethanol produced a rise in acetaldehyde levels. Incubation of oxygenated whole blood with ethanol produced a linear increase in acetaldehyde, whereas nitrogen-exposed blood produced no increase. The rise of acetaldehyde in the presence of ethanol was dependent on the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin A0. Addition of inhibitors of catalase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and glycolytic enzymes (aminotriazole, azide, pyrazole, sodium fluoride, sodium citrate, and iodoacetate) did not inhibit the rise of acetaldehyde, but addition of the hemoglobin ligand cyanide abolished the rise in acetaldehyde. Kinetic analysis with oxygenated whole blood plus inhibitors revealed a Km of 2.5 mM and Vmax of 1.42 microM/min. We conclude that oxyhemoglobin contributes to the metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde. These findings may explain in part the high levels of acetaldehyde found in red cells compared with plasma. The results also have implications for the optimum storage of blood samples for acetaldehyde analysis.	eng	1202	1206	Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research	18	5	1994	Oct		D000079/Q000097;D000437/Q000097;D002851/Q000379;D004305;D000431/Q000493;D006801;D010108/Q000502	Acetaldehyde/blood;Alcoholism/blood;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Ethanol/pharmacokinetics;Humans;Oxyhemoglobins/physiology	Chen HM;Lin WW;Ferguson KH;Scott BK;Peterson CM	Journal, Articles							red cell	True
518	8000511	Identification and characterization of dehydrocholic acid reductase system in the cytosol of human red blood cells.	We conducted in vivo and in vitro studies of the reductive metabolism of the cholagogue, dehydrocholic acid (DHCA). Immediately after the intravenous administration of 1 g of DHCA in normal subjects (n = 6), the concentration of the reductive metabolite, 3 alpha-hydroxy-7,12-dioxo-cholanoic acid (unconjugated form), increased sharply in the systemic circulation, rising to 95.8 microM 10 min after administration. The results of in vitro experiments with DHCA and whole blood showed that 3 alpha-hydroxy-7,12-dioxocholanoic acid were produced from DHCA. In vitro experiments using DHCA and the red blood cell fraction, and DHCA and the red blood cell cytoplasmic fraction gave similar results to those described above with whole blood. However, a reductive metabolite was not formed by the incubation of DHCA and the red blood cell membrane fraction. These findings indicated that, contrary to the conventional theory that intravenously administered DHCA is subjected to reductive metabolism only in the liver, reduction also occurs in the systemic circulation, and the mechanism for this reductive metabolism is present in the cytoplasmic fraction of red blood cells. Further investigation to characterize this reductive metabolic system revealed an optimum temperature of 37 degrees C, an optimum pH of 7.4, a Km value of 2.0 x 10(-3) M, and inactivation by heat treatment (70 degrees C for 2 min).	eng	621	630	Journal of gastroenterology	29	5	1994	Oct		D001647/Q000097;D003600/Q000201;D003685/Q000378;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D066298;D010084;D010088/Q000302	Bile Acids and Salts/blood;Cytosol/enzymology;Dehydrocholic Acid/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidoreductases/isolation & purification	Tani M;Goto J;Makino I	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
519	7918566	The permeability of the human red cell membrane to steroid sex hormones.	The release rates of the 3H-labeled steroid sex hormones estrone, estradiol, estriol, progesterone, and testosterone from the human red blood cell and resealed red cell ghosts were studied at 38 degrees C and pH 7.2 by means of the rapid continuous flow tube method which has a time resolution of a few milliseconds. Further, the equilibria between unbound hormone and hormone bound to red cells, resealed red cell ghosts and albumin were studied by partitioning analysis of trace amounts of labeled hormones. The half-times for release from erythrocytes under physiological conditions ranged from 4 ms (testosterone) to 150 ms (estriol). The release from ghosts was significantly faster than from cells preincubated with hormones at unphysiological high concentrations. Affinities of hormone binding to cells and hormone indicate that as much as 15-35% of the total hormone content in whole blood is confined to red cells. The ratio between bound and free hormone in the cell ranged from 5 to 10, and the ratio between cytoplasma-bound and membrane-bound hormone ranged between 3 and 9. The results are compatible with a model of fast transition of hormone through the red cell membrane and intracellular binding of hormone. We suggest that red cells function as carriers of sex hormones in the bloodstream in a manner similar to that of albumin, and that red cells may be responsible for 5-15% of sex hormone delivery to target tissues.	eng	55	62	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1195	1	1994	Oct	12	D001665;D002463;D004910/Q000378;D004964/Q000378;D004970/Q000378;D012739/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008433;D011374/Q000378;D012709/Q000378;D013739/Q000378;D014316	Binding Sites;Cell Membrane Permeability;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Estriol/metabolism;Estrone/metabolism;Gonadal Steroid Hormones/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Mathematics;Progesterone/metabolism;Serum Albumin/metabolism;Testosterone/metabolism;Tritium	Koefoed P;Brahm J	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
520	7988045	Nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase activity in human erythrocytes: studies using a new HPLC method.	A non-radiochemical method linked to reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography was developed to determine the activity of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.11) in crude lysates of human red blood cells. The method is accurate and easily reproducible in different chromatographic systems. The enzyme activity was determined in erythrocytes of healthy subjects and in patients with different purine disorders showing altered NAD levels. Very low enzyme activity was found in a boy hemizygous for phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity, consistent with the low erythrocyte NAD concentration.	eng	15	25	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	229	1-2	1994	Sep		D000228/Q000172;D000293;D000328;D002648;D002675;D002851/Q000379;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007041/Q000172;D007223;D008297;D008875;D009243/Q000097;D010430/Q000097	Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency;Adolescent;Adult;Child;Child, Preschool;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency;Infant;Male;Middle Aged;NAD/blood;Pentosyltransferases/blood	Pescaglini M;Micheli V;Simmonds HA;Rocchigiani M;Pompucci G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
521	7721801	Ubiquitin is conjugated to the cytoskeletal protein alpha-spectrin in mature erythrocytes.	Ubiquitination of red blood cell (RBC) proteins was investigated by encapsulation of 125I-ubiquitin into human erythrocytes using a procedure of hypotonic dialysis, isotonic resealing, and reannealing. Incubation (37 degrees C, up to 2 h) of 125I-ubiquitin-loaded cells resulted in the recovery of 125I-ubiquitin with the cytosolic proteins (9.22 +/- 0.4 micrograms/ml RBC) and conjugated to membrane proteins (2.18 +/- 0.05 micrograms/ml RBC). This conjugation was time-dependent, and the predominant membrane protein band that became labeled showed an apparent molecular mass of 240 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Western blotting experiments with three different anti-ubiquitin antibodies revealed that this protein is also ubiquitinated in vivo. Cell-free experiments have shown that fraction II (a DEAE-bound protein fraction eluted by 0.5 M KCl) prepared from both mature erythrocytes and reticulocytes is able to conjugate ubiquitin to this protein. Ubiquitin conjugation was ATP-dependent (Km 0.09 mM), time-dependent, and fraction II-dependent (8 +/- 0.5 pmol of 125I-ubiquitin/h/mg of fraction II). Isolation of the major RBC membrane protein that is ubiquitinated was obtained by using biotinylated ubiquitin. Membrane proteins, once ubiquitinated with this derivative, were extracted and purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized avidin. The major components retained by the column were two peptides of molecular masses 220 and 240 kDa. Both proteins are recognized by a monoclonal anti-spectrin antibody, but only the 240-kDa component is detected by streptavidin peroxidase conjugate. That indeed the ubiquitinated membrane protein of 240-kDa is alpha-spectrin was confirmed by immunoaffinity chromatography using 125I-ubiquitin and a monoclonal anti-spectrin antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were purified by protein A chromatography and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Again two bands of 240 and 220 kDa were eluted (alpha- and beta-spectrin), but only one band corresponding to the electrophoretic mobility of alpha-spectrin was detected by autoradiography. Thus, alpha-spectrin is a substrate for the ATP-dependent ubiquitination system, suggesting that the cytoskeleton is covalently modified by ubiquitination both in reticulocytes and mature RBC.	eng	8928	8935	The Journal of biological chemistry	270	15	1995	Apr	14	D001710/Q000378;D002478;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007457;D007700;D008565/Q000378;D011485;D013049/Q000378;D014452/Q000378	Biotin/metabolism;Cells, Cultured;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Iodine Radioisotopes;Kinetics;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Protein Binding;Spectrin/metabolism;Ubiquitins/metabolism	Corsi D;Galluzzi L;Crinelli R;Magnani M	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
522	8523391	Insulin resistance and not hyperinsulinaemia determines erythrocyte Na+/Li+ countertransport in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.	Insulin resistance and increased erythrocyte Na+/Li+ countertransport activity are well documented in subjects with essential hypertension, raising the question whether compensatory hyperinsulinaemia might be responsible for activating Na+/Li+ countertransport. We measured Na+/Li+ countertransport in 63 non-nephropathic non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects (36 hypertensive, 27 normotensive), finding no correlation with fasting levels of insulin (r = 0.074, P = 0.28), despite using a sensitive and specific insulin assay. In contrast, in 33 of the subjects in whom insulin sensitivity was measured, Na+/Li+ countertransport correlated significantly with the whole body glucose clearance rate (r = -0.37, P = 0.036). It is concluded that increased Na+/Li+ countertransport may be a cellular marker for insulin resistance, but that hyperinsulinaemia is not likely to be the factor which mediates this relation.	eng	685	686	Journal of human hypertension	9	8	1995	Aug		D000368;D017920/Q000032;D003924/Q000150;D003924/Q000378;D003924/Q000503;D004797;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D006946/Q000378;D006973/Q000150;D006973/Q000378;D006973/Q000503;D007333;D017136;D008094/Q000097;D008297;D008875;D011188/Q000097	Aged;Antiporters/analysis;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/metabolism;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/physiopathology;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Hyperinsulinism/metabolism;Hypertension/complications;Hypertension/metabolism;Hypertension/physiopathology;Insulin Resistance;Ion Transport;Lithium/blood;Male;Middle Aged;Potassium/blood	Pinkney JH;Denver AE;Foyle WJ;Foster C;Yudkin JS	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
523	8926533	Developmental changes of tetrahydrobiopterin in rat and human erythrocytes.	In the present study, we investigated the developmental changes of (1) plasma and erythrocyte tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4); (2) erythrocyte GTP cyclohydrolase (the rate-limiting enzyme of BH4 biosynthesis); (3) the permeability of erythrocyte membrane to BH4; and (4) plasma phenylalanine, both in healthy human subjects and Wistar rats. In vitro experiments demonstrated passive transport of BH4 into erythrocytes. In humans, BH4 levels as well as the other parameters were fairly consistent across all age groups. In contrast, Wistar rats showed significant developmental changes in erythrocyte BH4, which were not simply correlated to either GTP cyclohydrolase, permeability to BH4 or plasma phenylalanine levels. This may suggest the existence of other factors regulating the homeostasis of BH4, such as BH4-binding capacity in plasma and/or erythrocytes. These species/age differences in erythrocyte characteristics may influence the pharmacological behavior and clinical efficacy of BH4 in humans and experimental animals.	eng	607	617	Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology	41	6	1995	Dec		D000293;D000328;D000375/Q000097;D000818;D001708/Q000031;D001708/Q000097;D002463;D002648;D002675;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006136/Q000097;D006801;D007223;D007231;D008297;D051381;D017208	Adolescent;Adult;Aging/blood;Animals;Biopterins/analogs & derivatives;Biopterins/blood;Cell Membrane Permeability;Child;Child, Preschool;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;GTP Cyclohydrolase/blood;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Male;Rats;Rats, Wistar	Azumagawa K;Suzuki S;Mino M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
524	8526865	Purification and properties of a monoacylglycerol lipase in human erythrocytes.	A membrane-bound monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) activity, previously demonstrated in intact human erythrocytes [Boyer, Somma, Vérine, L'Hôte, Finidori, Merger and Arnaud (1981) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 53, 143-148], has now been purified to apparent homogeneity by a five-step procedure involving solubilization in CHAPS and sequential chromatographies on Sephacryl S-400, DEAE-Trisacryl, Zn(2+)-chelating Sepharose and Superose 12 columns. The purified protein has a molecular mass of 68 +/- 2 kDa, as determined by SDS/PAGE and gel filtration, suggesting that the enzyme behaves as a monomer. The concentration-dependence of MAGL activity with monooleoylglycerol, the preferred substrate showed kinetics typical of an interfacial lipolytic enzyme displaying optimal activity on emulsified substrate particles; apparent Km values were 0.27 mM and 0.49 mM for the sn-1(3)- and sn-2-isomers respectively. MAGL had no, or negligible, activity towards tri-oleoylglycerol, di-oleoylglycerol, oleoylcholesterol, oleoyl-CoA and phosphatidylcholine; it was inhibited by di-isopropylfluorophosphate, PMSF and diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate, suggesting that MAGL is a serine hydrolase. MAGL activity was not modified by bile salt or apolipoprotein C-II, whereas a dose-dependent inhibition was observed with apolipoprotein A-I.	eng	519	525	The Biochemical journal	312 ( Pt 2)	Pt 2	1995	Dec	01	D016632/Q000494;D002793/Q000494;D002846;D002850;D004591;D004791/Q000494;D004910/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008994/Q000097;D008994/Q000737;D008994/Q000302;D010261/Q000494;D013379	Apolipoprotein A-I/pharmacology;Cholic Acids/pharmacology;Chromatography, Affinity;Chromatography, Gel;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Monoacylglycerol Lipases/blood;Monoacylglycerol Lipases/chemistry;Monoacylglycerol Lipases/isolation & purification;Paraoxon/pharmacology;Substrate Specificity	Somma-Delpéro C;Valette A;Lepetit-Thévenin J;Nobili O;Boyer J;Vérine A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
525	8788940	Activation of a novel organic solute transporter in mammalian red blood cells.	1. Suspending human red blood cells in isotonic sucrose (low ionic strength, LIS) medium induces a significant increase in membrane transport of glutamine, glutamate, lactate, histidine, taurine, glycine, serine, choline and carnitine but not sorbitol or sucrose. 2. Progressive lowering of ionic strength by sucrose or NaCl replacement gave a similar activation profile for taurine influx as found earlier for residual K+(86Rb+) flux. 3. The induced taurine transport could be measured as enhanced influx and efflux. Influx was linear with external concentration up to 10 mM, largely insensitive to alteration in cell volume, and did not vary with red blood cell age. 4. Unlike previous results for residual K+ transport, altering transmembrane potential with gluconate or glucuronate media led to an increase in taurine influx similar to that observed in LIS media. Varying medium pH confirmed the effect was not due to alteration in pH. 5. The LIS-induced flux was sensitive to a variety of 'classical' anion transport inhibitors in the order of potency DNDS, DIDS, NPPB, DIOA, niflumic acid, furosemide (frusemide), glibenclamide, nitrendipine and bumetanide. 6. The taurine flux showed a temperature dependence similar to that of the LIS-induced residual K+ flux. High hydrostatic pressure (40 MPa), however, inhibited taurine flux but stimulated residual K+ influx in LIS media. 7. A significant enhanced taurine flux could be demonstrated in red blood cells of other species, including horse, cattle, pig and high and low potassium type sheep. 8. It is concluded that lowering ionic strength activates a transport pathway for organic molecules sharing some similarities with background Cl- channels and LIS-induced residual K+ fluxes. In the latter context, however, there are certain significant differences (effect of transmembrane potential; volume; pressure sensitivity; species distribution) which may be important, and the unequivocal identity of the two transport processes remains to be confirmed.	eng	755	765	The Journal of physiology	489 ( Pt 3)	Pt 3	1995	Dec	15	D000818;D027321;D000963/Q000494;D001711/Q000187;D001711/Q000502;D002352/Q000378;D002417;D003470;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D006736;D006801;D006863;D066298;D008564/Q000502;D009994;D011188/Q000097;D011312;D012756;D012964/Q000097;D013045;D013552;D013654/Q000097;D013696	Animals;Anion Transport Proteins;Antimetabolites/pharmacology;Biotransformation/drug effects;Biotransformation/physiology;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cattle;Culture Media;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Horses;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;In Vitro Techniques;Membrane Potentials/physiology;Osmolar Concentration;Potassium/blood;Pressure;Sheep;Sodium/blood;Species Specificity;Swine;Taurine/blood;Temperature	Culliford SJ;Bernhardt I;Ellory JC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
526	8554614	Thioredoxin-linked peroxidase from human red blood cell: evidence for the existence of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase in human red blood cell.	A thiol-dependent antioxidant protein (HRPRP) was previously reported as a predominant antioxidant protein in human red blood cell (RBC). The analysis of amino acid sequence of HRPRP with those of human PRP-like gene products indicates that HRPRP is identical to brain PRP (HPRP). This protein act as a peroxidase linked to thioredoxin (Trx)/thioredoxin reductase (TR). Until now, there was no evidence for Trx/TR system in RBC. The existence of the Trx/TR system in RBC was immunologically determined. A 58-kDa protein showing TR activity was partially purified from human RBC and characterized. Our results reveal that HRPRP act as a new type of peroxidase supported by Trx/TR system in human RBC.	eng	900	907	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	217	3	1995	Dec	26	D000595;D001798/Q000737;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008969;D009249/Q000378;D009363;D010084;D010446/Q000737;D010544/Q000097;D061105;D054464;D011506/Q000737;D013880/Q000097;D013879/Q000097	Amino Acid Sequence;Blood Proteins/chemistry;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Molecular Sequence Data;NADP/metabolism;Neoplasm Proteins;Oxidation-Reduction;Peptide Fragments/chemistry;Peroxidases/blood;Peroxiredoxin III;Peroxiredoxins;Proteins/chemistry;Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/blood;Thioredoxins/blood	Cha MK;Kim IH	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
527	7767787	"Diadenosine 5',5""'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate hydrolase is present in human erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets."	"An asymmetrically-cleaving diadenosine 5',5""'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate hydrolase (Ap4A-->ATP+AMP) is present in all higher eukaryotes and contributes to the regulation of the intracellular level of the alarmone nucleotide diadenosine 5',5""'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (Ap4A). This enzyme has previously been isolated from unfractionated human blood cells. The aim of this report is to determine the contribution made by different blood cell types as part of our study of the roles of Ap4A as an intra- and extracellular signalling molecule. Ap4A hydrolase was partially purified from isolated human erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets by high performance gel permeation chromatography and characterized by kinetic analysis and by probing immunoblots with an antibody raised against the human placental enzyme. Ap4A hydrolase was clearly present in all three cell types. Each enzyme comprised a single polypeptide of M(r) 19,200. The erythrocyte and platelet enzymes had a Km for Ap4A of 0.70 +/- 0.05 microM (n = 3) while the Km for the leukocyte enzyme was 1.50 +/- 0.20 microM (n = 3). All three enzymes showed substrate inhibition above 10 microM Ap4A. The specific activity of the enzyme in erythrocytes was 0.067 U/10(6) cells, 15-fold lower than that in leukocytes and platelets. However, the erythrocyte hydrolase accounted for 97% of the total activity of unfractionated blood cells (336 U out of 346 U/ml blood). The study shows that leukocytes, platelets and erythrocytes all contain Ap4A hydrolase activity. The last observation is of particular interest given the reported absence of Ap4A from enucleated erythrocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"	eng	201	206	The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology	27	2	1995	Feb		D017766/Q000032;D017766/Q000097;D017766/Q000302;D000595;D000818;D000906;D001792/Q000201;D002645/Q000276;D002850;D002851;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D015151;D007700;D007962/Q000201;D008969;D009842/Q000737;D009842/Q000276;D010920/Q000201;D011247	Acid Anhydride Hydrolases/analysis;Acid Anhydride Hydrolases/blood;Acid Anhydride Hydrolases/isolation & purification;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Antibodies;Blood Platelets/enzymology;Chickens/immunology;Chromatography, Gel;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Immunoblotting;Kinetics;Leukocytes/enzymology;Molecular Sequence Data;Oligopeptides/chemistry;Oligopeptides/immunology;Placenta/enzymology;Pregnancy	Hankin S;Matthew N;Thorne H;McLennan AG	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
528	7796469	Mechanism of the change in shape of human erythrocytes induced by lidocaine.	We studied the mechanism of the lidocaine-induced shape change in human erythrocytes. Immunohistochemical analysis of erythrocytes using spectrin-specific antibodies revealed aggregation of fluorescence in lidocaine-treated cells, while the fluorescence was distributed diffusely in untreated cells. The intracellular pH in lidocaine-treated erythrocytes was examined by flow cytometry of the cells labeled with 3'-acetyl-2'-carboxy-ethyl-6',7'-(dihydropyran-2'-one)-5-carboxyfluoresc ein diacethoxymethylester (BCECF-AM), and was found to decrease with increasing concentrations of lidocaine. Pre-treatment of erythrocytes with acetazolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, inhibited the lidocaine-induced spectrin aggregation and decrease in intracellular pH. When erythrocytes were incubated in medium containing bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of V-ATPase, followed by incubation with lidocaine, the cells changed shape slightly and the intracellular pH showed a small decrease in comparison with control. Spectrin dimers extracted from membranes normal erythrocytes were incubated in buffers of various pHs and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The amounts of spectrin dimers and tetramers decreased, while that of oligomers increased with decreasing pH. These results suggest that the lidocaine-induced shape change in human erythrocytes may occur by the conformational change of spectrin in a process that may be mediated by carbonic anhydrase and activation of V-ATPase.	eng	71	79	Cell structure and function	20	1	1995	Feb		D048429/Q000187;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000502;D005456;D006801;D006863;D008012/Q000494;D006180/Q000037;D006180/Q000378;D013049/Q000032	Cell Size/drug effects;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/physiology;Fluorescent Dyes;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Lidocaine/pharmacology;Proton-Translocating ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors;Proton-Translocating ATPases/metabolism;Spectrin/analysis	Nishiguchi E;Ozono S;Takakuwa Y;Hamasaki N	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes has a blocked amino-terminus and no information could be obtained by direct sequencing of the intact protein. The peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal region was isolated from a tryptic digest of the whole protein and identified on the basis of its amino acid composition and of the failure to obtain Edman degradation. Determination of peptide mass by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry allowed identification of the blocked amino-terminal residue as N-acetyl-alanine.	eng	331	338	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	207	1	1995	Feb	06	D000409/Q000031;D000409/Q000032;D000595;D000596/Q000032;D002851;D004912/Q000201;D005954/Q000097;D005954/Q000737;D006801;D008969;D010446/Q000737;D010446/Q000302;D016339;D014357	Alanine/analogs & derivatives;Alanine/analysis;Amino Acid Sequence;Amino Acids/analysis;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/blood;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/chemistry;Humans;Molecular Sequence Data;Peptide Fragments/chemistry;Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification;Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment;Trypsin	Camardella L;Damonte G;Carratore V;Benatti U;Tonetti M;Moneti G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
530	7758226	Comparison of erythrocyte transketolase activity with thiamine and thiamine phosphate ester levels in chronic alcoholic patients.	The effect of chronic alcoholism on biochemical evaluation of thiamine status was studied by the concomitant determination of erythrocyte transketolase (ETK) activity, its relative increase by in vitro addition of thiamine diphosphate (TDP effect) and the direct measurement of thiamine and its phosphate esters by high performance liquid chromatography. Thirty-eight percent of alcoholic subjects showed a thiamine deficiency with decreased thiamine diphosphate concentrations compared with healthy subjects (90.8 +/- 25.7 nmol/l vs. 176 +/- 28.0 nmol/l, respectively, mean +/- S.D., P < 0.001). Thiamine diphosphate concentrations were highly correlated with total thiamine concentrations and TDP effect (respectively r = 0.99 and 0.79, n = 85, P < 0.001). No abnormality in thiamine phosphorylation related to chronic alcoholism was noted. Finally, 47% of these deficient alcoholic patients had normal ETK activity. We concluded that, if indirect evaluation of thiamine status is to be chosen, the determination of ETK activity should be associated with TDP effect since the latter has been shown to be highly linked to total thiamine and thiamine diphosphate in erythrocytes. Furthermore, the direct measurement of thiamine and its phosphate esters was a more sensitive and specific index of thiamine nutrition.	eng	91	100	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	234	1-2	1995	Jan	31	D000328;D000368;D000369;D000437/Q000097;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D008297;D008875;D013831/Q000097;D013835/Q000097;D014174/Q000097	Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Alcoholism/blood;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Thiamine/blood;Thiamine Pyrophosphate/blood;Transketolase/blood	Herve C;Beyne P;Lettéron P;Delacoux E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Erythrocyte and plasma B-6 vitamer concentrations were determined in males aged 25-55 y who were long-term smokers, chewers, or nonusers. Tobacco users had either smoked (n = 23) or chewed (n = 11) for > 15 y; nonusers (n = 11) had never smoked or chewed. All subjects had normal hematocrit values. Food energy, protein, and vitamin B-6 intakes of the three groups of subjects were not significantly different. All subjects had fasting plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) concentrations indicative of adequacy. Erythrocyte B-6 vitamer and 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA) concentrations of all three groups were not significantly different. Nonusers had significantly higher plasma PLP concentrations than did smokers, whereas PLP concentrations of chewers were intermediate between the two groups. Chewers had significantly higher concentrations of plasma pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate (PMP) than other groups. Plasma pyridoxal, pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, and 4-PA concentrations of the three groups were not significantly different. Differences in some B-6 vitamer concentrations in plasma but not in erythrocytes were observed between tobacco users and nonusers.	eng	104	109	The American journal of clinical nutrition	62	1	1995	Jul		D000328;D000375/Q000502;D001827/Q000502;D001835/Q000502;D002851;D004435/Q000502;D004912/Q000737;D006400;D006801;D008297;D008875;D010947;D011733/Q000031;D011733/Q000097;D011735/Q000097;D011736/Q000008;D011736/Q000097;D012907/Q000097;D013997;D014030	Adult;Aging/physiology;Body Height/physiology;Body Weight/physiology;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Eating/physiology;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Hematocrit;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Plants, Toxic;Pyridoxamine/analogs & derivatives;Pyridoxamine/blood;Pyridoxic Acid/blood;Pyridoxine/administration & dosage;Pyridoxine/blood;Smoking/blood;Time Factors;Tobacco, Smokeless	Giraud DW;Martin HD;Driskell JA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
532	7586576	Demonstration of induction of erythrocyte inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase activity in Ribavirin-treated patients using a high performance liquid chromatography linked method.	The activity of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH: EC 1.2.1.14) was measured in erythrocyte lysates using a non-radiolabelled method linked to reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). The mean activity in erythrocytes from healthy controls using this sensitive method was extremely low (mean 85 pmol/h per mg protein, range 4-183). The elevated erythrocyte IMPDH activity reported previously in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency was confirmed (mean 234 pmol/h per mg protein). Erythrocyte IMPDH activity of patients with other disorders of purine metabolism, or with leukaemias and lymphomas, showed no marked difference from controls, except in one instance--an immunodeficient child with purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency, treated with Ribavirin, where a 30-fold increase in activity was found (2670 pmol/h per mg protein). Investigation of erythrocyte IMPDH in other immunodeficient children with normal PNP activity demonstrated that this grossly elevated erythrocyte activity was attributable to induction of IMPDH by Ribavirin therapy.	eng	169	178	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	238	2	1995	Jul	14	D000963/Q000494;D002648;D002851;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007041/Q000172;D007168/Q000096;D007168/Q000097;D007153/Q000097;D007153/Q000201;D007938/Q000097;D007938/Q000201;D008223/Q000097;D008223/Q000201;D011686/Q000175;D011686/Q000201;D012254/Q000494	Antimetabolites/pharmacology;Child;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency;IMP Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis;IMP Dehydrogenase/blood;Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/blood;Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/enzymology;Leukemia/blood;Leukemia/enzymology;Lymphoma/blood;Lymphoma/enzymology;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/diagnosis;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/enzymology;Ribavirin/pharmacology	Montero C;Duley JA;Fairbanks LD;McBride MB;Micheli V;Cant AJ;Morgan G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
533	7606008	Identification of a partial internal deletion in the RH locus causing the human erythrocyte D--phenotype.	The D--phenotype of the human erythrocyte is a genetic variant of the Rh blood group system associated with the expression of D but not C, c, E, and e (designated non-D) antigens. In this report, we characterize the structure and expression of Rh polypeptide genes in two D--homozygotes of Italian origin. Southern blot analysis detected a gross deletion in their genomic DNA that correlated with the alteration of CcEe rather than the D polypeptide gene. With detailed exon mapping, the deletion was found to be partial and internal, encompassing exons 2 through 8 of the non-D gene. Analysis of Rh cDNAs showed that no functional mRNA was produced from the truncated non-D gene, whereas the D gene gave rise to one major and two minor mature transcripts. The full-length RhD cDNA sequence contained four nucleotide changes resulting in four amino acid substitutions on the polypeptide backbone. The shortened RhD cDNAs occurred as alternatively spliced isoforms lacking sequences corresponding to exons 7 and/or 8. The identification of a partial and internal deletion in the non-D gene shows that the molecular basis for the D--phenotype is heterogenous and that its alterations have occurred on different genetic backgrounds.	eng	784	790	Blood	86	2	1995	Jul	15	D000595;D001483;D003062/Q000235;D004252;D018076/Q000235;D005091/Q000235;D005796;D006720;D006801;D007558;D008969;D010641;D012326;D012204/Q000235;D017384	Amino Acid Sequence;Base Sequence;Codon/genetics;DNA Mutational Analysis;DNA, Complementary/genetics;Exons/genetics;Genes;Homozygote;Humans;Italy;Molecular Sequence Data;Phenotype;RNA Splicing;Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/genetics;Sequence Deletion	Huang CH;Reid ME;Chen Y	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
534	7632170	Reduction and transport of lipoic acid by human erythrocytes.	Reduction of exogenous lipoic acid to dihydrolipoate is known to occur in several mammalian cells and tissues. Dihydrolipoate is a potent radical scavenger, and may provide significant antioxidant protection. Because lipoic acid appears in the bloodstream after oral administration, we have examined the reduction of exogenous lipoate by human erythrocytes. Normal human erythrocytes reduced lipoate to dihydrolipoate only in the presence of glucose; deoxyglucose did not substitute for glucose, indicating that the reduction of lipoate requires glucose metabolism. Furthermore, the reduction was shown to be NADPH dependent. Erythrocytes isolated from a human subject with a genetic deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (and, therefore, deficient in the formation of NADPH) did not reduce lipoate. Dehydroepiandrosterone, a specific inhibitor of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, inhibited lipoate reduction. Our findings imply that some of the reduction of exogenous lipoic acid is catalysed by glutathione reductase, a flavoprotein dehydrogenase; mitomycin C, an inhibitor of FAD-dependent reductases, inhibited lipoate reduction by erythrocytes, and glutathione reductase purified from human erythrocytes was observed to reduce lipoic acid in a cell-free system. We further explored these findings with erythrocyte ghosts and liposomes. Our results indicate that a transport system exists for alpha-lipoic acid and dihydrolipoate; resealed erythrocyte ghosts, containing trapped lipoamide dehydrogenase and pyridine nucleotides, reduced externally added lipoate. By contrast, liposomes prepared with enzyme and pyridine nucleotides did not catalyze reduction of lipoate. This work indicates that uptake of exogenous lipoate and reduction to dihydrolipoate by normal human erythrocytes may contribute to oxidant protection in the human bloodstream.	eng	253	261	Biochemical pharmacology	50	2	1995	Jul	17	D001692;D002851;D008058/Q000378;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005980/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D008081;D009249/Q000172;D010084;D008063/Q000031;D008063/Q000378	Biological Transport;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Dihydrolipoamide Dehydrogenase/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glutathione Reductase/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Liposomes;NADP/deficiency;Oxidation-Reduction;Thioctic Acid/analogs & derivatives;Thioctic Acid/metabolism	Constantinescu A;Pick U;Handelman GJ;Haramaki N;Han D;Podda M;Tritschler HJ;Packer L	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
535	7572221	Arachidonic acid transfer across the human red cell membrane by a specific transport system.	The exchange efflux kinetics of [3H]arachidonate at 0 degrees C, pH 7.3 from human red cell ghosts to bovine serum albumin (BSA) in buffer is analysed in terms of a closed three-compartment model. Using albumin-free ghosts the kinetics determines the model parameters: (1) The ratio of arachidonate bound to the inner membrane leaflet to that bound to the outer leaflet (B/E), 0.30 +/- 0.03 and (2) the rate constant of unidirectional flux through the membrane from B to E (k3), 0.39 +/- 0.03 s-1. From the model parameter estimates and knowledge of apparent equilibrium constants of arachidonate binding to ghost membrane and to albumin, we estimate the dissociation rate constant of arachidonate-albumin complex (k1) to 0.21 +/- 0.02 s-1. The lowest rate coefficient (delta) of efflux kinetics from albumin-filled ghosts decreases by approximately sevenfold over a 10-fold increase in intracellular albumin. These delta-values fit fairly well with the values predicted by the corresponding model with an unstirred intracellular compartment using the parameter values obtained in the studies with ghosts without BSA. Model parameters for arachidonate efflux are completely different from those obtained for palmitate, suggesting that different transport systems determine arachidonate and palmitate membrane transfer. The data show that binding to a limited number of specific sites is functioning as the initial and obligatory step in the transport. We propose that a protein is directly or indirectly controlling the transport capacity.	eng	253	267	Acta physiologica Scandinavica	154	2	1995	Jun		D000818;D016718/Q000097;D016718/Q000378;D001692;D002417;D002451;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008954;D012710/Q000378	Animals;Arachidonic Acid/blood;Arachidonic Acid/metabolism;Biological Transport;Cattle;Cell Compartmentation;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Models, Biological;Serum Albumin, Bovine/metabolism	Bojesen IN;Bojesen E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True
536	7769131	Nonadrenal epinephrine-forming enzymes in humans. Characteristics, distribution, regulation, and relationship to epinephrine levels.	Animal studies indicate that nonadrenal tissues may synthesize epinephrine (E). Here we demonstrate phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and/or nonspecific N-methyltransferase (NMT) enzymatic activity in human lung, kidney, heart, liver, spleen, and pancreas. There was a significant overall correlation (r = 0.34) between tissue PNMT and E. PNMT and NMT in human tissues differed in substrate and inhibitor specificity, thermal stability, and antigenicity. By these criteria, PNMT in human lung and in human bronchial epithelial cells were indistinguishable from adrenal PNMT. PNMT and/or NMT activity were present in red blood cells (RBCs), and cancer cell lines. Human kidney, lung, and pancreas showed immunohistochemical staining with an antibody to adrenal PNMT. RBC PNMT activity was lower in males than females and was increased in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism. PNMT activity in a human bronchial epithelial cell line was dramatically increased by incubation with dexamethasone. E and 3H-E levels in plasma and urine during an intravenous infusion of 3H-E into humans indicated that kidney may synthesize half of urinary E. We conclude that PNMT and NMT are widely distributed in human tissues, that they may synthesize E in vivo and are influenced by glucocorticoid and thyroid hormones.	eng	2896	2902	The Journal of clinical investigation	95	6	1995	Jun		D000311/Q000201;D002460;D004837/Q000096;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007158;D066298;D007668/Q000201;D008168/Q000201;D008297;D008780/Q000378;D008875;D010625/Q000378;D014018	Adrenal Glands/enzymology;Cell Line;Epinephrine/biosynthesis;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Immunologic Techniques;In Vitro Techniques;Kidney/enzymology;Lung/enzymology;Male;Methyltransferases/metabolism;Middle Aged;Phenylethanolamine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism;Tissue Distribution	Kennedy B;Bigby TD;Ziegler MG	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True

Three independent cDNAs coding for the erythrocyte isoform of human acylphosphatase were isolated and characterized. All the clones were incomplete at the 5' end, but Northern blot analysis using the cDNA as a probe showed the presence of an unusually long mRNA 5'-untranslated region.

538	7797558	Kidd blood group and urea transport function of human erythrocytes are carried by the same protein.	The gene encoding the urea transporter of human erythrocytes (HUT11 clone) has been cloned recently (Olives, B., Neau, P., Bailly, P., Hediger, M. A., Rousselet, G., Cartron, J. P., and Ripoche, P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 31649-31652). Now, this gene has been assigned to chromosome 18q12-q21 by in situ hybridization, as also found for the Kidd (Jk) blood group locus. In coupled transcription-translation assays, the HUT11 cDNA directed the synthesis of a 36-kDa protein which was immunoprecipitated by a human anti-Jk3 antibody produced by immunized Jk(a-b-) donors whose red cells lack Kidd antigens. The anti-Jk3 antibody also immunoprecipitated a protein material of 46-60 kDa from all red cell membranes, except those from Jk(a-b-) cells. After N-glycanase digestion the 46-60-kDa component was reduced to 36 kDa. A rabbit antibody raised against the predicted NH2-terminal amino-acids of the HUT11 protein reacted on immunoblots with a 46-60-kDa component present in all human erythrocytes except those from Jk(a-b-) individuals. Jk(a-b-) red cells lack the Kidd/urea transport protein and have a selective defect of the urea transport capacity, but a normal water permeability and aquaporin-associated Colton blood group antigens. These findings indicate that the erythrocyte urea transporter is encoded by the Kidd locus and may have implications for the biology of urea transporters and their tissue-specific regulation.	eng	15607	15610	The Journal of biological chemistry	270	26	1995	Jun	30	D000818;D001692;D002352/Q000235;D002352/Q000502;D002874;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007667/Q000235;D007667/Q000502;D008970;D010539;D011817;D014508/Q000378	Animals;Biological Transport;Carrier Proteins/genetics;Carrier Proteins/physiology;Chromosome Mapping;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kidd Blood-Group System/genetics;Kidd Blood-Group System/physiology;Molecular Weight;Permeability;Rabbits;Urea/metabolism	Olivès B;Mattei MG;Huet M;Neau P;Martial S;Cartron JP;Bailly P	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
539	7702576	Detection of acyl-CoA-binding protein in human red blood cells and investigation of its role in membrane phospholipid renewal.	Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) has been identified in a number of tissues and shown to affect the intracellular distribution and utilization of acyl-CoA. We have detected ACBP in the cytosol but not the membrane of human red blood cells and, using an e.l.i.s.a. with antibodies prepared against human liver ACBP, found that its concentration was 0.5 microM. To investigate the role of ACBP in human red blood cells, we added purified human liver ACBP and radiolabelled acyl-CoA to isolated membranes from these cells. ACBP prevented high concentrations of acyl-CoA from binding to the membrane but could not keep the acyl-CoA in the aqueous phase at low concentrations. This suggested the presence of a pool in the membrane with a binding affinity for acyl-CoA that was greater than that of ACBP for acyl-CoA. In the presence of lysophospholipid, this membrane-bound pool of acyl-CoA was rapidly used as a substrate by acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LAT) to generate phospholipid from lysophospholipid. We also found that ACBP-bound acyl-CoA was preferred over free acyl-CoA as a substrate by LAT. These results are the first documentation that human red blood cells contain ACBP and that this protein can affect the utilization of acyl-CoA in plasma membranes of these cells. The interactions between acyl-CoA, ACBP and the membrane suggest that there are several pools of acyl-CoA in the human red blood cell and that ACBP may have a role in regulating their distribution and fate.	eng	793	799	The Biochemical journal	306 ( Pt 3)	Pt 3	1995	Mar	15	D000214/Q000378;D002352/Q000302;D002352/Q000378;D026261;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D010743/Q000378	Acyl Coenzyme A/metabolism;Carrier Proteins/isolation & purification;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Diazepam Binding Inhibitor;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Phospholipids/metabolism	Fyrst H;Knudsen J;Schott MA;Lubin BH;Kuypers FA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
540	7763257	The presence of 2-keto-3-deoxygluconic acid and oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase activity in human erythrocytes.	2-Keto-3-deoxygluconic acid (3-DGA) is produced from 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG:a highly reactive glycation intermediate) through oxidation by the enzyme oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase (OAD) in animals. We developed a specific assay method for 3-DGA using high-performance liquid chromatography [Fujii, E. et al. (1994) J. Chromatogr. B 660, 265-270] and measured it in the hemolysate and plasma of diabetic patients and healthy subjects. Both human erythrocytes and plasma contained considerable amounts of 3-DGA. However, human erythrocyte contained about 30-50 times higher 3-DGA than human plasma did and also had the same ability to convert 3-DG to 3-DGA as OAD had. Erythrocyte 3-DGA levels of diabetic patients were 990 +/- 370 nmol/gHb (n = 57, Mean +/- SD) and were significantly higher compared with healthy subjects (527 +/- 194 nmol/gHb, n = 7, p < 0.01). In all diabetic patients and healthy subjects (n = 64), there was only one patient who had a very low level of erythrocyte 3-DGA and lacked the ability to convert 3-DG to 3-DGA. When erythrocytes were incubated at 37 degrees C for 8 hours in phosphate buffer containing 0.35 mM 3-DG, 3-DG was easily taken into the erythrocytes and was converted to 3-DGA. Our results suggest the contribution of OAD not only to the prevention of glycation of hemoglobin but also to that of blood vessels by scavenging plasma 3-DG into erythrocytes.	eng	852	857	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	210	3	1995	May	25	D000328;D000368;D000429/Q000097;D001692;D002851;D003922/Q000097;D003922/Q000201;D003924/Q000097;D003924/Q000201;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D005942/Q000097;D006801;D007700;D008297;D008875;D012016	Adult;Aged;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/blood;Biological Transport;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/blood;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/enzymology;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/enzymology;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Gluconates/blood;Humans;Kinetics;Male;Middle Aged;Reference Values	Fujii E;Iwase H;Ishii-Karakasa I;Yajima Y;Hotta K	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
541	8563768	Higher activity of polymorphic thiopurine S-methyltransferase in erythrocytes from neonates compared to adults.	Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyses the S-methylation of aromatic and heterocyclic sulfhydryl compounds, including thiopurine antimetabolites (i.e. mercaptopurine and thioguanine). The activity of TPMT in erythrocytes and other tissues exhibits genetic polymorphism, which is inherited as an autosomal codominant trait. Although inheritance is the principal determinant of TPMT activity, other factors (e.g. renal function, race and thiopurine therapy) have been shown to influence erythrocyte TPMT activity. Because the TPMT polymorphism has not been established in early erythrocyte populations, and the activity of many enzymes differs in neonates, we determined the activity of TPMT in erythrocytes obtained from 60 full-term newborns. Median peripheral blood TPMT activity was 25.3 U per ml pRBC (range 9-52.8 U per ml pRBC), which was > 50% higher than race matched healthy adults (p < 0.001). Western blot analysis demonstrated higher TPMT protein content in erythrocytes from newborns compared to adults, and revealed a significant correlation between TPMT protein and TPMT activity in erythrocytes (rs = 0.63, p = 0.03). Although erythrocyte TPMT activity was significantly higher in newborns, the distribution of activity in newborns was consistent with the genetic polymorphism previously observed in adults.	eng	281	286	Pharmacogenetics	5	5	1995	Oct		D000328;D000375/Q000378;D044383/Q000235;D015153;D004912/Q000201;D005312/Q000201;D006801;D007231;D008780/Q000097;D008780/Q000235;D011110;D012016;D014481;D044465/Q000235	Adult;Aging/metabolism;Black People/genetics;Blotting, Western;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Fetal Blood/enzymology;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Methyltransferases/blood;Methyltransferases/genetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Reference Values;United States;White People/genetics	McLeod HL;Krynetski EY;Wilimas JA;Evans WE	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Its robust peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity that is strongly inhibited by the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and rapamycin indicates that it is an immunophilin belonging to the FKBP class. The finding that its peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity is also strongly inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) suggests that IP3 and IP4 could be physiological ligands for this membrane-associated immunophilin.	eng	212	218	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	215	1	1995	Oct	04	D000591/Q000037;D000591/Q000097;D000595;D002352/Q000037;D002352/Q000097;D004268/Q000097;D004791/Q000494;D004910/Q000737;D006360/Q000097;D006801;D007163;D007166/Q000494;D015544/Q000494;D007295/Q000378;D008969;D019696;D010766;D011090/Q000494;D020123;D016559/Q000494;D022021	Amino Acid Isomerases/antagonists & inhibitors;Amino Acid Isomerases/blood;Amino Acid Sequence;Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors;Carrier Proteins/blood;DNA-Binding Proteins/blood;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/chemistry;Heat-Shock Proteins/blood;Humans;Immunosorbent Techniques;Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology;Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/pharmacology;Inositol Phosphates/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Peptidylprolyl Isomerase;Phosphorylation;Polyenes/pharmacology;Sirolimus;Tacrolimus/pharmacology;Tacrolimus Binding Proteins	Cunningham EB	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
543	7559611	Heme degradation in the presence of glutathione. A proposed mechanism to account for the high levels of non-heme iron found in the membranes of hemoglobinopathic red blood cells.	Unstable hemoglobins and oxidative conditions tend to produce hemichromes which demonstrably release their heme to the erythrocyte membrane, with consequent lipid peroxidation and cell lysis. High levels of non-heme iron are also found in such circumstances, but the origin of this iron is uncertain. In the present work, we show that reduced glutathione (GSH) is able to degrade heme in solution with a pH optimum of 7. Degradation depended on the presence of oxygen and on heme and GSH concentrations. It was inhibited by catalase and superoxide dismutase, implicating the involvement of perferryl reactive species in the process of heme degradation. Heme degradation at pH 7 and 37 degrees C is rapid (t1/2 = 70 s) and results in the release of iron from heme. Heme that was dissolved in red blood cell ghosts is also degraded by GSH with a concomitant increase in non-heme iron, most of which (75%) remains associated with the cell membrane. Loading of intact erythrocytes with heme was followed by time-dependent decrease of membrane-associated heme and caused an acceleration of the hexose monophosphate shunt due to the production of H2O2 and the oxidation of intracellular GSH. Most of the activation of the hexose monophosphate pathway was due to redox cycling of iron, since iron chelators inhibited it considerably. These results explain the origin of non-heme iron found in the membrane of sickle cells and the oxidative stress that is observed in these and other abnormal erythrocytes.	eng	24876	24883	The Journal of biological chemistry	270	42	1995	Oct	20	D003676/Q000494;D004910/Q000378;D005978/Q000494;D006418/Q000378;D006453/Q000097;D006801;D006861/Q000378;D007501/Q000378;D010427	Deferoxamine/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Glutathione/pharmacology;Heme/metabolism;Hemoglobinopathies/blood;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism;Iron/metabolism;Pentose Phosphate Pathway	Atamna H;Ginsburg H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
544	7577655	Glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase in normal human erythrocytes.	In the course of an investigation of hexosamine catabolism in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, it became apparent that a basic understanding of the relevant enzymatic reactions in the host erythrocyte is lacking. To acquire the necessary basic knowledge, we have determined the activities of several enzymes involved in hexosamine metabolism in normal human red blood cells. In the present communication we report the results of studies of glucosamine 6-phosphate deaminase (GlcN6-P) using a newly developed sensitive radiometric assay. The mean specific activity in extracts of fresh erythrocytes assayed within 4h of collection was 14.7 nmol/h/mg protein, whereas preparations from older erythrocytes that had been stored at 4 degrees C for up to 4 weeks had a mean specific activity of 6.2 nmol/h/mg. Characterization of the deaminase by chromatofocusing gave a pI of 8.55. The enzyme was optimally active at pH 9.0 and had a Km of 41 microM. The metal chelators EDTA and EGTA were non-inhibitory; however, inhibition was observed in the presence of metal ions, especially Cu2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+. In addition, the deaminase was also inhibited by several sugar phosphates including the reaction product, fructose 6-phosphate.	eng	72	79	British journal of haematology	91	1	1995	Sep		D019747;D002238/Q000097;D002238/Q000187;D002241/Q000494;D002469;D002852;D004912/Q000201;D005434;D006801;D007700;D016778/Q000201;D008670/Q000494;D013696	Aldose-Ketose Isomerases;Carbohydrate Epimerases/blood;Carbohydrate Epimerases/drug effects;Carbohydrates/pharmacology;Cell Separation;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Flow Cytometry;Humans;Kinetics;Malaria, Falciparum/enzymology;Metals/pharmacology;Temperature	Weidanz JA;Campbell P;DeLucas LJ;Jin J;Moore D;Rodén L;Yu H;Heilmann E;Vezza AC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
545	8869744	The phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase family.	The existence of a PIP5K family of enzymes has been suggested by Western blotting and purification of numerous PIP5Ks from various tissues and cell types. The erythrocyte has at least two PIP5Ks, named PIP5KI and PIP5KII, while the brain appears to have even more isoforms. The cloning of the first PIP5K, the PIP5KII alpha, is just the beginning of the molecular classification of this protein family. The PIP5KII alpha sequence has shown that these enzymes lack obvious homology to protein, sugar and other lipid kinases. The identification of two S. cerevisiae homologues, Mss4p and Fab1p, confirms that this family of kinases is widely distributed in eukaryotes. Not surprisingly, cloning experiments have identified additional isoforms. By cloning additional isoforms, insights into the structure and functions of this family of enzymes will be gained. One reason for a large family of PIP5Ks is that many forms of regulation and cellular functions have been ascribed to PIP5Ks, as summarized in Figure 10. Some of these functional links result from PtdIns[4,5]P2 being required for a given process, but the direct involvement of specific PIP5Ks is not well defined. Which PIP5K isoforms are regulated by a specific mechanism or are involved in a cellular process often is not clear. For example, which PIP5Ks produce PtdIns[4,5]P2 that is hydrolyzed by PLC or phosphorylated by the PI 3-kinase is not known. A few exceptions are PIP5KII not being able to phosphorylate PtdIns[4,5]P2 in native membranes, and PIP5KIs being stimulated by PtdA, required for secretion, and possibly regulated by G proteins of the Rho subfamily. The multiplicity of regulation and functions of each PIP5K isoform remains to be elucidated. Another factor governing the number of isoforms may be presence of multiple pools of polyphosphoinositides and the localizing of PIP5K function within cells. The polyphosphoinositides appear to be compartmentalized within cells and each pool appears to be sensitive to specific signals. These polyphosphoinositide pools may include those in the plasma membrane that are used by PLC, nuclear pools that appear to turn over separately from cytoplasmic pools and a small pool at sites of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. Each pool may be controlled by a specific PIP5K isoform. This would explain the diversity of PIP5K cellular roles. Another possibility is that the PIP5Ks are localized to certain areas of the cell by being part of a protein or proteolipid complex. Furthermore, the presence of PITP or PLC in the complex would potentially impart specificity and speed on the use of PtdIns[4]P and PtdIns[4,5]P2 because these lipids could be channeled quickly from one enzyme to the next. The concept of localized complexes containing particular PIP5K isoforms that control the composition of different polyphosphoinositide pools will likely be important as the family of PIP5K isoforms grows.	eng	115	140	Advances in enzyme regulation	36		1996			D000595;D003001;D004912/Q000201;D019204/Q000378;D006801;D008969;D010712/Q000494;D018129/Q000378;D010716/Q000378;D017853/Q000737;D017853/Q000302;D017853/Q000378;D017421;D017386	Amino Acid Sequence;Cloning, Molecular;Erythrocytes/enzymology;GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism;Humans;Molecular Sequence Data;Phosphatidic Acids/pharmacology;Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/metabolism;Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/chemistry;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/isolation & purification;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism;Sequence Analysis;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid	Loijens JC;Boronenkov IV;Parker GJ;Anderson RA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
546	8904295	Ascorbate recycling in human erythrocytes: role of GSH in reducing dehydroascorbate.	Human erythrocytes regenerate ascorbate from its oxidized product, dehydroascorbate. The extent to which such ascorbate recycling occurs by a GSH-dependent mechanism was investigated. In the presence of glucose, erythrocytes took up over 90% of extracellular [14C]dehydroascorbate and rapidly converted it to [14C]ascorbate, which was trapped within the cells. Dehydroascorbate uptake and reduction was not associated with generation of a monoascorbyl free radical intermediate. Uptake and reduction of dehydroascorbate by glucose-depleted erythrocytes coordinately decreased GSH and raised GSSG concentrations in erythrocytes. This effect was reversed by D-glucose, but not by L-lactate. Conversely, depletion of cellular GSH decreased the ability of cells to recycle dehydroascorbate to ascorbate, as reflected in the extent to which cells were able to reduce extracellular ferricyanide. Monoascorbyl free radical was formed during the reduction of extracellular ferricyanide, indicating that one electron transfer steps were involved in this process. In GSH-depleted cells, addition of L-lactate as an energy source for glycolysis-dependent NADH regeneration did cause a partial recovery of the ability of cells to reduce ferricyanide. However, in resealed erythrocyte ghosts containing either 4 mM GSH or 400 mu M NADH, only the GSH-containing ghosts supported regeneration of ascorbate from added dehydroascorbate. These results suggest that in human erythrocytes ascorbate regeneration from dehydroascorbate is largely GSH dependent, and that it occurs through either enzymatic or nonenzymatic reactions not involving the monoascorbyl free radical.	eng	543	551	Free radical biology & medicine	20	4	1996			D001205/Q000097;D003683/Q000097;D004912/Q000502;D005292/Q000378;D005978/Q000502;D006801;D010084	Ascorbic Acid/blood;Dehydroascorbic Acid/blood;Erythrocytes/physiology;Ferricyanides/metabolism;Glutathione/physiology;Humans;Oxidation-Reduction	May JM;Qu ZC;Whitesell RR;Cobb CE	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
547	8937691	Conversion of adrenaline to indolic derivatives by the human erythrocyte plasma membrane.	The conversion of adrenaline to aminochromes by the human erythrocyte plasma membranes at pH 9.5 was shown to be a complex reaction that proceeded at least by two distinct phases. The first one, corresponding to the formation of adrenochrome, is catalyzed in the presence of the membranes, suggesting the involvement of an enzyme-mediated process. Active oxygen species were identified as intermediates during this phase. Oxygen radical scavengers (catalase and superoxide dismutase) suggested H2O2 and O2- involvement. Adrenochrome formation was stimulated by NADH indicating the participation of another enzyme (NADH dehydrogenase) which is known to be present in the human erythrocyte plasma membrane. The second phase, corresponding to the disappearance of adrenochrome, is also stimulated by NADH and inhibited in the presence of the membranes. In this reaction, adrenochrome is converted to aminochromes via adrenochrome semiquinone. The formation of radical species is demonstrated by EPR spectroscopy. The results led to the proposal of a mechanism for the formation of adrenochrome and other oxidation products from adrenaline.	eng	275	282	Biological signals	5	5	1996			D016227/Q000378;D004837/Q000378;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D007211/Q000378;D010084;D013053	Benzoquinones/metabolism;Epinephrine/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Indoles/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Spectrophotometry	Marques F;Duarte RO;Moura JJ;Bicho MP	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
548	9252787	Kinetic studies of the effects of K+, Na+ and Li+ on the catalytic activity of human erythrocyte pyridoxal kinase.	Kinetic studies were conducted to examine the effects of K+, Na+ and Li+ on human erythrocyte pyridoxal kinase (PK) activity. A dialyzed hemolysate served as the PK source. The substrates used were pyridoxal (PL) and ATP. Determination of the enzymatic activity was based on HPLC separation and fluorimetric detection of PL and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate as semicarbazone derivatives. In comparison to the poor activity of PK assayed without monovalent cation, all tested cations are activators. Among them, K+ is the most effective, improving both PK affinity for the substrates and maximal velocity. Na+ increases maximal velocity and PK affinity for ATP but decreases it for PL. Li+ is a poor activator which seems to modify the enzymatic mechanism from a random to an ordered sequential pattern with ATP bound before PL. Results suggest that K+ and Na+ bind to PK on the same site while Li+ binds on another site. This hypothesis and the mechanism of monovalent cation-PK interaction are compared to other well-known K(+)-activated enzymes.	eng	291	304	Enzyme & protein	49	5-6	1996			D000255/Q000378;D002414/Q000737;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008094/Q000737;D009994;D011188/Q000737;D011730/Q000378;D011731/Q000097;D011731/Q000737;D011731/Q000378;D012964/Q000737	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Cations, Monovalent/chemistry;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Lithium/chemistry;Osmolar Concentration;Potassium/chemistry;Pyridoxal/metabolism;Pyridoxal Kinase/blood;Pyridoxal Kinase/chemistry;Pyridoxal Kinase/metabolism;Sodium/chemistry	Lainé-Cessac P;Allain P	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
549		HUMAN ERYTHROCYTIC CYCLOPHILINS: ISOLATION, CHARACTERIZATION AND STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION	Two cyclosporin A (CsA) binding proteins were purified to homogeneity from human erythrocytes by consecutive steps of repeated gel chromatography, hydrophobic HPLC, ion exchange HPLC and reverse phase HPLC. Purified proteins I and II showed almost identical molecular masses and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activities which were completely abolished in the presence of CsA. On the other hand, pl values of the two proteins were distinctly different, 9.1 and 8.1, respectively, and the CsA-binding affinity (Kd) of protein I was 15.3 nM and that of II 25.0 nM. Amino acid sequence analysis of protein I in intact form has shown to be Val as the amino terminal residue of the protein, while no phenylthiohydantoinylated amino acid was detected in the sequence analysis of intact protein II, suggesting the presence of a modified or blocked amino acid at the amino terminus of the protein. The complete amino acid sequence of protein I was identified with [Phe��]-human cyclophilin A. Significantly high CsA-binding affinities of the present two proteins in human erythrocytes pose a problem of possible implication of CsA bound to such proteins in erythrocytes in pharmacology and/or toxicology of CsA through the blood cell fate.		213	219	Biomedical Research	17	3	1996					Kurokawa N, Yamamoto K, Kadobayashi M, Arakawa Y, Sawada M, Ohishi T, Mochizuki T, Yanaihara N, Yanaihara C	Journal, Article					10.2220/biomedres.17.213		ERYTHRO;erythrocyte	True
550	8732257	Oleic acid binding and transport capacity of human red cell membrane.	Resealed human red cell membranes, ghosts, bind oleate (OL) by a limited number of sites when equilibrated at 37 degrees C, pH 7.3 with OL bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) in molar ratios below 1.5. The binding capacity is 34 +/- 2.2 nmol g-1 ghosts with a dissociation equilibrium constant (37 degrees C) Kdm 1.38 +/- 0.15 fold Kd of albumin binding Kdm is temperature independent and approximately 7-8 nM. Exchange efflux kinetics at 0 degrees C to buffers of various albumin concentrations ([BSAy]) is biexponential and is analysed in terms of a three-compartment model. Accordingly the ratio of inner to outer membrane leaflet binding sites is 0.450 +/- 0.018 and the rate constant of unidirectional flux from inside to outside is 0.067 +/- 0.01 s-1. The rate constant of flux from the extracellular side of the membrane to BSAy increases with the square root of [BSAy] as expected of an unstirred layer effect. This provides an estimate of the dissociation rate constant of OL-BSA complex at 0 degrees C of 0.0063 +/- 0.0003 s-1. Exchange efflux from ghosts containing four different [BSAi] obeys the expected kinetics of a three-compartment approximation of the theoretical model. Accounting for the effect of an unstirred fluid inside ghosts, the rate coefficients fit the values predicted by the parameters obtained by the studies of albumin-free ghosts. The results show that the OL transport across the membrane is mediated exclusively by the asymmetrically distributed binding sites. The differences between transport sites of three long-chain fatty acids suggest that they are protein determined microdomains of phospholipids.	eng	501	516	Acta physiologica Scandinavica	156	4	1996	Apr		D000818;D001665;D001692;D002417;D002462/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D009829/Q000378;D010539	Animals;Binding Sites;Biological Transport;Cattle;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Oleic Acids/metabolism;Permeability	Bojesen IN;Bojesen E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True
551	8660320	Purification and characterization of a glutathione dependent dehydroascorbate reductase from human erythrocytes.	A GSH-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase (EC 1.8.5.1) was purified to homogeneity from human erythrocytes. The enzyme was a monomer of 32 kDa and was purified 133-fold from a crude DEAE-Sepharose fraction with a 25% yield. The reduced protein had a pI of 5.1 as judged by isoelectric focusing. Kinetic analysis gave a Kcat of 316 min-1, a Km of 0.21 mM for DHA with a Kcat/Km of 2.47 x 10(4) M-1 sec-1, and a Km of 3.5 mM for GSH with a Kcat/Km of 1.51 x 10(3) M-1 sec-1. This is the second DHA reductase (after thioltransferase) isolated from human erythrocytes, but unlike thioltransferase, it has no thiol-disulfide oxido-reductase activity.	eng	117	121	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	221	1	1996	Apr	05	D002852;D004591;D004912/Q000201;D054477;D005978/Q000378;D006801;D007525;D007700;D010088/Q000097;D010088/Q000302;D011490	Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glutaredoxins;Glutathione/metabolism;Humans;Isoelectric Focusing;Kinetics;Oxidoreductases/blood;Oxidoreductases/isolation & purification;Protein Disulfide Reductase (Glutathione)	Xu DP;Washburn MP;Sun GP;Wells WW	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

The Hill coefficient in F inhibition in controls was different from that in multisystemic diseases patients but not from that in myotonia congenita patients.

553	8982040	N-acetylglucosamine kinase and N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate deacetylase in normal human erythrocytes and Plasmodium falciparum.	The major pathways of glucose metabolism in the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, have now been elucidated, and the structures and properties of parasite-specific enzymes are presently being investigated. Little is known, however, about the enzymes catalysing monosaccharide interconversions in the parasite. In the present investigation we have examined the pathway of N-acetylglucosamine catabolism which, in higher organisms, involves the following reaction sequence: N-acetylglucosamine -->N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate-->glucosamine 6-phosphate-->fructose 6-phosphate. Assay of the specific kinase (E.C. 2.7.1.59) catalysing the phosphorylation of the sugar showed that the enzyme is present in Plasmodium extracts as well as in normal human erythrocytes; specific activities of 7.2 and 5.3 nmol/h/mg protein were measured for the parasite and erythrocyte extracts, respectively, N-Acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate deacetylase (E.C. 3.5.1.25), catalysing the second reaction, was also detected in both normal and Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes. At 75% parasitaemia, the deacetylase activity was close to 3 times higher than that of normal control cells. The erythrocyte deacetylase was purified approximately 16,000-fold by chromatography on DE52 cellulose, chromatofocusing, and size exclusion chromatography. Attempts to purify the parasite enzyme by the same procedures were unsuccessful due to loss of activity. A partially purified erythrocyte deacetylase preparation (eluted from DE52 cellulose) had a pH optimum of 7.5, a pI of 6.0, as indicated by chromatofocusing, and a K(m) of 29 microM. In conjunction with previous investigations, the present study indicated that all three enzymes required for N-acetylglucosamine utilization are present in Plasmodium parasites as well as in normal erythrocytes.	eng	645	653	British journal of haematology	95	4	1996	Dec		D000581/Q000378;D000818;D002851;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000469;D006801;D017853/Q000378;D010963/Q000201;D001619/Q000378	Amidohydrolases/metabolism;Animals;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Humans;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism;Plasmodium falciparum/enzymology;beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism	Weidanz JA;Campbell P;Moore D;DeLucas LJ;Rodén L;Thompson JN;Vezza AC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
554	8955136	Type I phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases are distinct members of this novel lipid kinase family.	Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5K) synthesize phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, a key precursor in phosphoinositide signaling that also regulates some proteins and cellular processes directly. Two distinct PIP5Ks have been characterized in erythrocytes, the 68-kDa type I (PIP5KI) and 53-kDa type II (PIP5KII) isoforms. Using peptide sequences from the erythroid 68-kDa PIP5KI, we have isolated cDNAs encoding PIP5KIalpha from human brain. Partial cDNAs obtained for a second isoform, PIP5KIbeta, established that the human STM7 gene encoded a previously unrecognized PIP5KI. However, the peptide sequences demonstrated that erythroid PIP5KI corresponded to PIP5KIalpha. Recombinant, bacterially expressed PIP5KIalpha possessed PIP5K activity and was immunoreactive with erythroid PIP5KI antibodies. By Northern analysis, PIP5KIalpha and PIP5KIbeta had wide tissue distributions, but their expression levels differed greatly. PIP5KIs had homology to the kinase domains of PIP5KIIalpha, yeast Mss4p and Fab1p, and a new Caenorhabditis elegans Fab1-like protein identified in the data base. These new isoforms have refined the sequence requirements for PIP5K activity and, potentially, regulation of these enzymes. Furthermore, the limited homology between PIP5KIs and PIP5KIIalpha, which was almost exclusively within the kinase domain core, provided a molecular basis for distinction between type I and II PIP5Ks.	eng	32937	32943	The Journal of biological chemistry	271	51	1996	Dec	20	D000595;D000818;D017173/Q000201;D002417;D003001;D003429;D018076/Q000235;D015870;D033862;D007527/Q000235;D008969;D017853/Q000235;D017853/Q000302;D017853/Q000378;D012333/Q000235;D000096923	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Caenorhabditis elegans/enzymology;Cattle;Cloning, Molecular;Cross Reactions;DNA, Complementary/genetics;Gene Expression;Iron-Binding Proteins;Isoenzymes/genetics;Molecular Sequence Data;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/isolation & purification;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism;RNA, Messenger/genetics;Frataxin	Loijens JC;Anderson RA	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte;erythro	True

556	8576117	Functional analysis of aquaporin-1 deficient red cells. The Colton-null phenotype.	The aquaporin-1 (AQP1) water transport protein contains a polymorphism corresponding to the Colton red blood cell antigens. To define the fraction of membrane water permeability mediated by AQP1, red cells were obtained from human kindreds with the rare Colton-null phenotype. Homozygosity or heterozygosity for deletion of exon I in AQP1 correlated with total or partial deficiency of AQP1 protein. Homozygote red cell morphology appeared normal, but clinical laboratory studies revealed slightly reduced red cell life span in vivo; deformability studies revealed a slight reduction in membrane surface area. Diffusional water permeability (Pd) was measured under isotonic conditions by pulsed field gradient NMR. Osmotic water permeability (Pf) was measured by change in light scattering after rapid exposure of red cells to increased extracellular osmolality. AQP1 contributes approximately 64% (Pd = 1.5 x 10(-3) cm/s) of the total diffusional water permeability pathway, and lipid permeation apparently comprises approximately 23%. In contrast, AQP1 contributes > 85% (Pf = 19 x 10(-3) cm/s) of the total osmotic water permeability pathway, and lipid permeation apparently comprises only approximately 10%. The ratio of AQP1-mediated Pf to Pd predicts the length of the aqueous pore to be 36 A.	eng	1309	1313	The Journal of biological chemistry	271	3	1996	Jan	19	D051398;D020346;D001789;D001834/Q000378;D002463;D004058;D004905/Q000235;D004907/Q000235;D004910/Q000502;D004912/Q000502;D005260;D006580;D006720;D006801;D007473/Q000097;D007473/Q000172;D007473/Q000235;D007700;D008297;D008433;D008954;D010375;D010641	Aquaporin 1;Aquaporins;Blood Group Antigens;Body Water/metabolism;Cell Membrane Permeability;Diffusion;Erythrocyte Aging/genetics;Erythrocyte Deformability/genetics;Erythrocyte Membrane/physiology;Erythrocytes/physiology;Female;Genetic Carrier Screening;Homozygote;Humans;Ion Channels/blood;Ion Channels/deficiency;Ion Channels/genetics;Kinetics;Male;Mathematics;Models, Biological;Pedigree;Phenotype	Mathai JC;Mori S;Smith BL;Preston GM;Mohandas N;Collins M;van Zijl PC;Zeidel ML;Agre P	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
557	8837234	Export of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) from human erythrocytes characterized by inside-out membrane vesicles.	The present study was undertaken to characterize the export of cGMP from human erythrocytes at 37 degrees C. Inside-out membrane vesicles were exposed to cGMP and [3H]-cGMP in the presence and absence of 2 mmol l-1 ATP. In the absence of ATP, an equilibrium was reached within 15 min for the lowest tested concentration (0.65 mumol l-1), and the amount of cGMP in the vesicles was linearly correlated to the cGMP concentrations in the incubate. These observations suggest that the ATP-independent process represents passive diffusion or non-saturated binding to membrane components. In the presence of ATP, cGMP accumulated linearly during the test period (up to 120 min) and the transport into the inside-out vesicles was dependent on both low- and high-Km transport. The kinetic parameters for the low-Km process were determined after 5 and 120 min, the Km values being 4.6 (SD 1.9) and 4.7 (SD 1.1) mumol l-1 (n = 3), respectively. The corresponding Vmax values were 400 (SD 50) and 440 (SD 70) fmol mg-1 min-1. The high-Km process was characterized by Km = 170 (SD 50) mumol-1 and Vmax = 1610 (SD 280) fmol mg-1 min-1 (n = 5). The present data demonstrate an ATP-requiring saturable transport system for cGMP in human erythrocytes.	eng	289	293	Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation	56	4	1996	Jul		D000255/Q000494;D001692;D002855;D006152/Q000378;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D007700	Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology;Biological Transport;Chromatography, Thin Layer;Cyclic GMP/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics	Sager G;Orbo A;Pettersen RH;Kjørstad KE	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
558	8663431	Isolation of an erythrocyte membrane protein that mediates Ca2+-dependent transbilayer movement of phospholipid.	"Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ in erythrocytes, platelets, and other cells initiates rapid redistribution of plasma membrane phospholipids (PL) between inner and outer leaflets, collapsing the normal asymmetric distribution. Consequently, phosphatidylserine and other lipids normally sequestered to the inner leaflet become exposed at the cell surface. This Ca2+-induced mobilization of phosphatidylserine to the surface of activated, injured, or apoptotic cells confers a procoagulant property to the plasma membrane, which promotes fibrin clotting and provides a signal for cell removal by the reticuloendothelial system. To identify the constituent of the membrane that mediates this Ca2+-dependent ""PL scramblase"" activity, we undertook purification and reconstitution of membrane component(s) with this activity from detergent extracts of erythrocyte ghosts depleted of cytoskeleton. Active fractions were identified by their capacity to mediate the Ca2+-dependent redistribution of 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl-labeled PL between leaflets of reconstituted proteoliposomes. This PL scramblase activity co-eluted through multiple chromatographic steps with a single polypeptide of approximately 37 kDa, which was purified to apparent homogeneity as resolved by silver staining. The activity associated with this protein band was inactivated by trypsin. The isolated protein reconstituted in proteoliposomes mediated nonselective, bidirectional transport of 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl-PL between membrane leaflets, with half-maximal activation between 20 and 60 microM Ca2+ (saturation >100 microM), mimicking the Ca2+-dependent transbilayer lipid movement intrinsic to the erythrocyte membrane."	eng	17205	17210	The Journal of biological chemistry	271	29	1996	Jul	19	D009327/Q000031;D002118/Q000097;D002118/Q000494;D002352/Q000097;D002352/Q000302;D002852;D004591;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008051;D008274/Q000494;D008563/Q000097;D008565/Q000097;D008565/Q000302;D008970;D010713;D010718;D049294;D010743/Q000097	4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan/analogs & derivatives;Calcium/blood;Calcium/pharmacology;Carrier Proteins/blood;Carrier Proteins/isolation & purification;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Lipid Bilayers;Magnesium/pharmacology;Membrane Lipids/blood;Membrane Proteins/blood;Membrane Proteins/isolation & purification;Molecular Weight;Phosphatidylcholines;Phosphatidylserines;Phospholipid Transfer Proteins;Phospholipids/blood	Bassé F;Stout JG;Sims PJ;Wiedmer T	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
559	8695634	The ferritins: molecular properties, iron storage function and cellular regulation.	"The iron storage protein, ferritin, plays a key role in iron metabolism. Its ability to sequester the element gives ferritin the dual functions of iron detoxification and iron reserve. The importance of these functions is emphasised by ferritin's ubiquitous distribution among living species. Ferritin's three-dimensional structure is highly conserved. All ferritins have 24 protein subunits arranged in 432 symmetry to give a hollow shell with an 80 A diameter cavity capable of storing up to 4500 Fe(III) atoms as an inorganic complex. Subunits are folded as 4-helix bundles each having a fifth short helix at roughly 60 degrees to the bundle axis. Structural features of ferritins from humans, horse, bullfrog and bacteria are described: all have essentially the same architecture in spite of large variations in primary structure (amino acid sequence identities can be as low as 14%) and the presence in some bacterial ferritins of haem groups. Ferritin molecules isolated from vertebrates are composed of two types of subunit (H and L), whereas those from plants and bacteria contain only H-type chains, where 'H-type' is associated with the presence of centres catalysing the oxidation of two Fe(II) atoms. The similarity between the dinuclear iron centres of ferritin H-chains and those of ribonucleotide reductase and other proteins suggests a possible wider evolutionary linkage. A great deal of research effort is now concentrated on two aspects of ferritin: its functional mechanisms and its regulation. These form the major part of the review. Steps in iron storage within ferritin molecules consist of Fe(II) oxidation, Fe(III) migration and the nucleation and growth of the iron core mineral. H-chains are important for Fe(II) oxidation and L-chains assist in core formation. Iron mobilisation, relevant to ferritin's role as iron reserve, is also discussed. Translational regulation of mammalian ferritin synthesis in response to iron and the apparent links between iron and citrate metabolism through a single molecule with dual function are described. The molecule, when binding a [4Fe-4S] cluster, is a functioning (cytoplasmic) aconitase. When cellular iron is low, loss of the [4Fe-4S] cluster allows the molecule to bind to the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the ferritin m-RNA and thus to repress translation. In this form it is known as the iron regulatory protein (IRP) and the stem-loop RNA structure to which it binds is the iron regulatory element (IRE). IREs are found in the 3'-UTR of the transferrin receptor and in the 5'-UTR of erythroid aminolaevulinic acid synthase, enabling tight co-ordination between cellular iron uptake and the synthesis of ferritin and haem. Degradation of ferritin could potentially lead to an increase in toxicity due to uncontrolled release of iron. Degradation within membrane-encapsulated ""secondary lysosomes' may avoid this problem and this seems to be the origin of another form of storage iron known as haemosiderin. However, in certain pathological states, massive deposits of ""haemosiderin' are found which do not arise directly from ferritin breakdown. Understanding the numerous inter-relationships between the various intracellular iron complexes presents a major challenge."	eng	161	203	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1275	3	1996	Jul	31	D000818;D005293/Q000502;D005786;D005796;D006706;D006801;D007501/Q000378;D046911;D008958;D008969;D011487;D012333/Q000235;D012045;D016415;D017386	Animals;Ferritins/physiology;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Homeostasis;Humans;Iron/metabolism;Macromolecular Substances;Models, Molecular;Molecular Sequence Data;Protein Conformation;RNA, Messenger/genetics;Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid	Harrison PM;Arosio P	Journal, Articles							erythro	True
560	8679659	A kinetic characterization of putrescine and spermidine uptake and export in human erythrocytes.	Using human erythrocytes as a model system for the study of mammalian polyamine transport, detailed kinetic parameters regarding the uptake and export of putrescine and spermidine were determined. The putrescine uptake data indicated a multi-component uptake system comprised of a low-capacity saturable component and a non-saturable component. The saturable putrescine uptake component demonstrated a calculated Km of 21.0 microM and a V(max) of only 6.52 x 10(-13) M/s. The non-saturable linear putrescine uptake rate was defined by a significant pH dependence, a lack of uptake inhibition by related polyamines, and a permeability pi of 3.19 x 10(-8) s-1. These findings suggested that non-saturable putrescine uptake involved a process of simple diffusion. Spermidine uptake exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km and Vmax of 12.5 microM and 1.36 x 10(-12) M/s, respectively. Spermidine uptake did not demonstrate pH dependence and was not significantly inhibited by any of the tested polyamines. The Arrhenius plot of spermidine uptake was determined to be biphasic with calculated activation energies of spermidine uptake of 135.2 kJ/mol for 19-21 degrees C and 59.3 kJ/mol for 21-35 degrees C. These data suggest the possibility of multiple spermidine uptake processes which are not mediated by simple diffusion across the cell membrane. The putrescine export process demonstrated both saturable and non-saturable components. The calculated Km, V(max) and pi for putrescine export were 33.8 microM, 1.19 x 10(-11) M/s and 2.81 x 10(-7) s-1, respectively. The spermidine export process was non-saturable up to intracellular spermidine concentrations of 4 microM. At similar intracellular and extracellular concentrations of putrescine and spermidine, however, export processes displayed rates which were an order of magnitude greater than their respective uptake rates. This finding supports the possible presence of mediated putrescine and spermidine export processes different than simple diffusion.	eng	48	56	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1282	1	1996	Jun	13	D001692;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D007700;D011700/Q000097;D013095/Q000097;D013816	Biological Transport;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Putrescine/blood;Spermidine/blood;Thermodynamics	Fukumoto GH;Byus CV	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
561	8727676	Is erythrocyte alkaline phosphatase activity a marker of zinc status in humans?	The identification of an enzyme activity that responds to changes in Zn intake may serve as a useful biomarker for Zn status. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a dimeric protein with each subunit containing two Zn atoms. The activity of ALP in erythrocytes (E) decreases as a result of a low Zn diet, which suggests that this enzyme may be a marker of Zn status. To investigate this further, we determined the response of E-ALP in six healthy subjects following supplementation with 50 mg Zn (4.2 x RDI) daily for 4 wk. A small but significant increase in plasma Zn was observed with supplementation (p < 0.05), whereas there was no significant change in E-Zn over the same period. Plasma and E-Cu showed no change. Conversely, the activity of E-ALP increased in all subjects from 1.7 +/- 0.5 to 5.9 +/- 0.7 U/g protein (mean +/- SE) (p < 0.0001). The small change observed in plasma Zn is not biologically significant in view of the many documented factors that influence its concentration. Our data support the hypothesis that E-ALP is a marker of Zn status in humans.	eng	285	291	Biological trace element research	51	3	1996	Mar		D000328;D000469/Q000097;D001315;D015415/Q000097;D003300/Q000097;D004305;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008297;D013334;D015032/Q000008;D015032/Q000097;D015032/Q000494	Adult;Alkaline Phosphatase/blood;Australia;Biomarkers/blood;Copper/blood;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Male;Students;Zinc/administration & dosage;Zinc/blood;Zinc/pharmacology	Samman S;Soto C;Cooke L;Ahmad Z;Farmakalidis E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

To study the regulation of band 3 phosphorylation, we examined phosphotyrisine phosphatase (PTP) activity in the human erythrocyte. We show that the human erythrocyte membrane contains a band 3-associated neutral PTP which is activated by Mg2+ and inhibited by Mn2+ and vanadate. The PTP is active in the intact cell and in the isolated membrane. A major fraction of the PTP is tightly bound to the membrane and can be extracted from it by Triton X-100; a minor part is associated with Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton. The behaviour of the PTP parallels that of band 3, the major fraction of which is extractable by detergents with a minor fraction being anchored to the cytoskeleton. Moreover, band 3 is co-precipitated when the PTP is immunoprecipitated from solubilized membranes, and PTP is co-precipitated when band 3 is immunoprecipitated. The PTP appears to be related to PTP1B (identified using an antibody to an epitope in its catalytic domain and by molecular mass). The system described here has a unique advantage for PTP research, since it allows the study of the interaction of a PTP with an endogenous physiological substrate that is present in substantial amounts in the cell membrane. The membrane-bound, band 3-associated, PTP may play a role in band 3 function in the erythrocyte and in other cells which have proteins analogous to band 3.	eng	881	887	The Biochemical journal	314 ( Pt 3)	Pt 3	1996	Mar	15	D001457/Q000737;D001457/Q000302;D001457/Q000378;D004591;D004910/Q000201;D006801;D015151;D007700;D008970;D010766;D019000/Q000032;D017027/Q000097;D017027/Q000302;D013379	Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/chemistry;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/isolation & purification;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Humans;Immunoblotting;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;Phosphorylation;Phosphotyrosine/analysis;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/blood;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/isolation & purification;Substrate Specificity	Zipser Y;Kosower NS	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
563	8737076	A dopamine transporter in human erythrocytes: modulation by insulin.	Red blood cells are capable of transport and accumulation of catecholamines. The aim of this paper is to characterize the catecholamine transport system in the human red blood cell and in particular that of dopamine. Dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline enter the red blood cell by a similar process, which shows saturation kinetics with Vmax values of 0.54 +/- 0.12, 0.48 +/- 0.08 and 0.63 +/- 0.13 mumol (1 cells)-1 min-1, respectively, and K(m) values of 15.62 +/- 1.19, 5.81 +/- 1.19 and 12.00 +/- 2.97 nM, respectively. Observations based on the dependence of dopamine influx on the transmembrane H+ gradient, and the effect of transport inhibitors such as DMA (dimethyl-amiloride), DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene 2,2'-disulphonic acid), reserpine, GBR 12909 (1-(2-(di(4-fluoro-phenyl)-methoxy)-ethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine) , GBR 12935 (1-(2-(diphenyl-methoxy)-ethyl)-4-(3-phenyl-propyl)piperazine), and cyanine suggest that catecholamine transport is not mediated by the Na(+)-H+ exchanger, the anion exchanger or a system similar to that responsible for dopamine uptake in either synaptosomes or the proximal tubule. However, choline inhibits the influx of dopamine with an IC50 value of 17 microM and stimulates the efflux of dopamine with a K(m) value of 8.20 microM. These results strongly suggest that dopamine is transported by the choline exchanger previously reported to be present in red blood cells. Probenecid inhibits dopamine uptake with an IC50 of 0.63 microM. The presence of insulin receptors in human red blood cells, and the relationship between insulin and catecholamine levels in the plasma led us to investigate the effect of insulin on catecholamine transport. In fasting subjects, dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline influxes were higher than in fed subjects. Furthermore, the addition of exogenous insulin to red blood cells from fasting subjects significantly reduced the influx of catecholamines while no effect was observed when insulin was added to red blood cells obtained from fed subjects. The present study shows that catecholamines, and in particular dopamine, are transported in red blood cells via an exchanger which is possibly the choline transport system. The activity of this transporter is regulated by insulin. These results support a role for red blood cells as a storage pool for circulating catecholamines.	eng	421	434	Experimental physiology	81	3	1996	May		D017878/Q000494;D000584/Q000031;D000584/Q000494;D001692;D002352/Q000378;D002395/Q000378;D002794/Q000494;D004298/Q000378;D050483;D018765/Q000494;D004837/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D007328/Q000494;D008024;D008562;D026901;D009419;D009638/Q000378;D010879/Q000494;D011339/Q000494;D012110/Q000494;D013997	4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid/pharmacology;Amiloride/analogs & derivatives;Amiloride/pharmacology;Biological Transport;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Catecholamines/metabolism;Choline/pharmacology;Dopamine/metabolism;Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins;Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors/pharmacology;Epinephrine/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Insulin/pharmacology;Ligands;Membrane Glycoproteins;Membrane Transport Proteins;Nerve Tissue Proteins;Norepinephrine/metabolism;Piperazines/pharmacology;Probenecid/pharmacology;Reserpine/pharmacology;Time Factors	Azoui R;Cuche JL;Renaud JF;Safar M;Dagher G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte;Red blood cell	True
564	8930838	Interactions between the histidine stimulation of cadmium and zinc influx into human erythrocytes.	1. Histidine (2-40 mM) stimulated cadmium uptake into human erythrocytes incubated in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin to ensure that the free, ionic cadmium concentration was low. 2. The histidine-stimulated cadmium uptake correlated with the calculated concentration of the cadmium-bis-histidine complex rather than the cadmium-mono-histidine complex or free ionic cadmium. 3. The histidine stimulation of cadmium uptake was saturable and stereospecific. D-Histidine (10 mM) had no effect. 4. Cadmium and zinc were both able to inhibit 65Zn2+ uptake into erythrocytes incubated in the presence of 40 mM L-histidine. The relationships between the percentage inhibition of 65Zn2+ uptake and the calculated concentrations of cadmium-bis-histidine and zinc-bis-histidine were very similar, which suggests that the metal histidine complexes compete for a common transport mechanism. 5. Pretreatment of the erythrocytes with N-ethylmaleimide using a protocol which is known to inhibit the system y+ amino acid transport mechanism had no effect on the histidine stimulation of metal transport.	eng	711	718	The Journal of physiology	496 ( Pt 3)	Pt 3	1996	Nov	01	D000818;D001692/Q000187;D002104/Q000097;D002417;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005033/Q000494;D006639/Q000494;D006801;D066298;D007700;D008297;D012710;D015032/Q000097;D015037	Animals;Biological Transport/drug effects;Cadmium/blood;Cattle;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology;Histidine/pharmacology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Male;Serum Albumin, Bovine;Zinc/blood;Zinc Radioisotopes	Horn NM;Thomas AL	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

567	9110994	Purification and biochemical characterization of a protein-palmitoyl acyltransferase from human erythrocytes.	Protein palmitoylation involves the post-translational attachment of palmitate in thioester linkage to cysteine residues of proteins. The labile nature of the thioester linkage makes possible the palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycles that have emerged in recent times as additions to the repertoire of cellular control mechanisms. However, detailed understanding of these cycles has been limited by the lack of knowledge of the transferases and thioesterases likely to be involved. Here, we describe the purification of a protein-palmitoyl acyltransferase (PAT) from human erythrocytes. PAT behaved as a peripheral membrane protein and catalyzed the attachment of palmitate in thioester linkage to the beta-subunit of spectrin. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, PAT appeared as a 70-kDa polypeptide. Antibody against this polypeptide could immunodeplete PAT activity from the crude extract, confirming the assignment of the 70-kDa polypeptide as PAT. PAT-mediated spectrin palmitoylation could be inhibited by nonradioactive palmitoyl-, myristoyl-, or stearoyl-CoA. The apparent Km for palmitoyl-CoA was 16 microM.	eng	11021	11025	The Journal of biological chemistry	272	17	1997	Apr	25	D000215;D000217/Q000302;D000217/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D010168/Q000378;D010171/Q000378;D010449;D011499;D013049/Q000378;D013379	Acylation;Acyltransferases/isolation & purification;Acyltransferases/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Palmitates/metabolism;Palmitoyl Coenzyme A/metabolism;Peptide Mapping;Protein Processing, Post-Translational;Spectrin/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Das AK;Dasgupta B;Bhattacharya R;Basu J	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

In this paper, we report a family with compensated chronic haemolysis where the only erythrocyte abnormality detected was an increased level of erythrocyte CDP-choline. Using 31P-NMR spectroscopy and enzymatic analysis the possibility of a pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase deficiency was excluded. Thus, this family represents the first evidence for a hereditary haemolytic anaemia where the inferred enzymatic defect is located to choline phosphotransferase, the enzyme catalysing the final step in lecithin synthesis.

569	9361033	An adenosine deaminase (ADA) allele contains two newly identified deleterious mutations (Y97C and L106V) that interact to abolish enzyme activity.	Genetic deficiency of the purine salvage enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) results in varying degrees of immunodeficiency, ranging from neonatal onset Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) to an adult onset immunodeficiency disorder. Multiple different mutations have now been identified in these immunodeficient patients. Additional mutations, initially identified in healthy individuals, abolish ADA in erythrocytes but retain 10-80% of activity in non-erythroid cells ('partial deficiency mutations'). In general, severity of disease correlates inversely with the amount of residual ADA expressed by the mutant enzymes and directly with the accumulation of the toxic metabolites deoxyATP and deoxyadenosine. We report two newly identified mutations (Y97C and L106V), both carried on the same allele of an immunodeficient patient who was diagnosed prenatally and successfully transplanted with haploidentical bone marrow. Based on the ability of mutant cDNAs to express ADA in vitro , the L106V mutation resulted in activity similar to 'partial' mutations (30% of normal) while the Y97C mutation resulted in detectable but markedly reduced activity (1.5% of normal). However, the presence of both mutations on the same allele virtually abolished detectable enzyme activity. Analysis of the crystallographic structure of ADA to understand the marked deleterious effect of the Y97C mutation suggested a previously unappreciated role of salt bridges in the catalytic mechanism of ADA. The patient was also heteroallelic for a previously described deletion of the promoter and exon 1. Testing of additional patients in whom we had not identified a mutation on the second allele revealed presence of this deletion in three of four patients tested. This deletion is therefore relatively common, accounting for 10% of almost 100 chromosomes studied by this and other laboratories, but is easily missed by currently used methods of mutation detection. Lastly, the finding of two mutations on the same allele that interact to reduce residual enzyme function emphasizes hazards in evaluating potential genotype-phenotype correlations in individuals analyzed only for the presence of single specific mutations.	eng	2271	2278	Human molecular genetics	6	13	1997	Dec		D000243/Q000737;D000243/Q000172;D000243/Q000235;D000243/Q000378;D000483;D000649;D000653/Q000166;D001665;D016026;D002384;D002478;D018360;D004252;D018076/Q000235;D005260;D005315/Q000201;D005315/Q000235;D005315/Q000473;D005838;D006801;D007223;D007231;D008297;D017354;D017384;D016511/Q000201;D016511/Q000235;D016511/Q000628	Adenosine Deaminase/chemistry;Adenosine Deaminase/deficiency;Adenosine Deaminase/genetics;Adenosine Deaminase/metabolism;Alleles;Amniocentesis;Amniotic Fluid/cytology;Binding Sites;Bone Marrow Transplantation;Catalysis;Cells, Cultured;Crystallography, X-Ray;DNA Mutational Analysis;DNA, Complementary/genetics;Female;Fetal Diseases/enzymology;Fetal Diseases/genetics;Fetal Diseases/pathology;Genotype;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Male;Point Mutation;Sequence Deletion;Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/enzymology;Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/genetics;Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/therapy	Jiang C;Hong R;Horowitz SD;Kong X;Hirschhorn R	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte;erythro	True
570	9432090	Exercise-induced changes in enzymatic O-methylation of catecholestrogens by erythrocytes of eumenorrheic women.	The present study was designed to assess the effects of acute exercise and short-term intensive training on catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity. COMT inactivates catecholamines and converts primary catecholestrogens (CE) into their O-methylated form yielding the 2- (2-MeOE) and 4-methoxyestrogens (4-MeOE). Blood samples were obtained from 15 previously untrained eumenorrheic women (mean +/- SE, VO2max: 43.8 mL x kg-1 x min-1 +/- 0.6) before and after a 5-d intensive training period, at rest and during incremental exercise. COMT activity was determined in the erythrocytes (RBC-COMT) after incubation of blood lysate with primary CE. The formation of both 2- and 4-MeOE was significantly higher (P < 0.05) during the luteal (LPh) than during the follicular phase (FPh). The amount of 2-MeOE formed (FPh: 4.2 +/- 0.2%; LPh: 4.9 +/- 0.2%) was significantly greater than the produced amount of 4-MeOE (FPh: 1.4 +/- 0.1%; LPh: 1.5 +/- 0.1%) (P < 0.05). Both before and after training, incremental exercise did not significantly alter RBC-COMT activity although we observed a trend for RBC-COMT activity increasing proportionally with the exercise intensity. After a brief period of exhaustive training, during rest the formation of 2-MeOE (FPh: +16.7%, LPh: +15.7%) and 4-MeOE (FPh: +28.6%; LPh: +40%) was significantly (P < 0.05) increased. The results of the present study are consistent with earlier findings reporting increased plasma concentrations of O-methylated CE following training. It is concluded that RBC-COMT activity is increased by brief intensive training, but not by acute exercise. We speculate that an increase in COMT-catalyzed O-methylation of CE may indicate that less COMT is available to deactivate norepinephrine.	eng	1580	1587	Medicine and science in sports and exercise	29	12	1997	Dec		D000293;D000328;D000568/Q000378;D002394/Q000097;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D002393/Q000097;D015444/Q000502;D005260;D006801;D008597/Q000502;D008745	Adolescent;Adult;Amenorrhea/metabolism;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/blood;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Estrogens, Catechol/blood;Exercise/physiology;Female;Humans;Menstrual Cycle/physiology;Methylation	De Crée C;Van Kranenburg G;Geurten P;Fujimura Y;Keizer HA	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
571	9426231	Transport of glutathione prostaglandin A conjugates by the multidrug resistance protein 1.	The human multidrug resistance protein MRP1 mediates transport of organic substrates conjugated to glutathione, glucuronide, or sulfate. The naturally occurring prostaglandins A1 and A2 can form two diastereomeric glutathione S-conjugates, and it has been speculated that these might be substrates for MRP1. Here we present evidence that polarized MDCKII cells expressing MRP1 cDNA transport PGA1-GS to the basolateral side of a cell monolayer, in accordance with the lateral localization of human MRP1 in these cells. Furthermore, we show that vesicles made from yeast cells expressing MRP1 cDNA and from mouse erythrocytes (known to contain mrpl) actively accumulate both diastereomers of PGA2-GS with a similar efficiency. Recently, we generated mice with a homozygous mutant mrp1 allele. Uptake of PGA2-GS in vesicles made from erythrocytes of these mice was 3.2 times lower than in wild-type vesicles, but was still significantly above background. This residual transport activity was partly inhibited by methotrexate and cAMP, whereas mrp1-mediated activity was unaffected by these compounds. We conclude that mouse erythrocytes contain at least two transport systems for PGA2-GS. One of these is mrp1; the other one has not been identified yet, but can be inhibited by methotrexate and cAMP.	eng	112	116	FEBS letters	419	1	1997	Dec	08	D020168/Q000235;D020168/Q000502;D000255/Q000502;D000818;D001692;D002460;D016764;D000242/Q000494;D004285;D004912;D004976/Q000378;D005978/Q000031;D005978/Q000378;D006801;D007668/Q000166;D008727/Q000494;D051379;D008817;D008861/Q000378;D011455/Q000378;D013237	ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics;ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/physiology;Adenosine Triphosphate/physiology;Animals;Biological Transport;Cell Line;Cell Polarity;Cyclic AMP/pharmacology;Dogs;Erythrocytes;Ethacrynic Acid/metabolism;Glutathione/analogs & derivatives;Glutathione/metabolism;Humans;Kidney/cytology;Methotrexate/pharmacology;Mice;Mice, Mutant Strains;Microsomes/metabolism;Prostaglandins A, Synthetic/metabolism;Stereoisomerism	Evers R;Cnubben NH;Wijnholds J;van Deemter L;van Bladeren PJ;Borst P	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
572	9428647	Pyrimidine nucleotidases from human erythrocyte possess phosphotransferase activities specific for pyrimidine nucleotides.	Two cytoplasmic forms of pyrimidine nucleotidase (PN-I and PN-II) have been purified from human erythrocytes to apparent homogeneity and partially characterized. They preferentially hydrolyse pyrimidine 5'-monophosphates and 3'-monophosphates respectively. PN-I and PN-II operate as interconverting activities, capable of transferring the phosphate from the pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphate donor(s) to various nucleoside acceptors, including important drugs like 3'-azido-3'-deoxy-thymidine (AZT), cytosine-beta-D-arabinofuranoside (AraC) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxy-uridine (5FdUrd), pyrimidine analogues widely used in chemotherapy. Kinetic analysis showed linear behaviour for both PN-I and PN-II. PN-I phosphotransferase activity revealed higher affinity for oxynucleosides with respect to deoxy-nucleosides, whereas the contrary seems to be true for PN-II. These results show for the first time that soluble pyrimidine nucleotidases are endowed with pyrimidine-specific phosphotransferase activity.	eng	263	267	FEBS letters	419	2-3	1997	Dec	15	D004912/Q000201;D006801;D009708/Q000378;D010770/Q000378;D011743/Q000378	Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Nucleotidases/metabolism;Phosphotransferases/metabolism;Pyrimidines/metabolism	Amici A;Emanuelli M;Magni G;Raffaelli N;Ruggieri S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
573	9051091	Addition of L-carnitine to additive solution-suspended red cells stored at 4 degrees C reduces in vitro hemolysis and improves in vivo viability.	The role of L-carnitine (LC) as the requisite carrier of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria is well established. Human red cells (RBCs), which lack mitochondria, possess a substantial amount of LC and its esters. In addition, carnitine palmitoyl transferase, an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transfer of the acyl moiety from acyl-coenzyme A to LC is found in RBCs. It has recently been shown that LC and carnitine palmitoyl transferase play a major role in modulating the pathway for the turnover of membrane phospholipid fatty acids in intact human RBCs, and that LC improved the membrane stability of RBCs subjected to high shear stress. RBC membrane lesions occur during storage at 4 degrees C; this study investigated whether the addition of LC (5 mM) to a standard RBC preservative solution (AS-3) affected cellular integrity with 42 days' storage.	eng	166	174	Transfusion	37	2	1997	Feb		D000225/Q000494;D001793/Q000379;D002331/Q000494;D002951/Q000494;D015925;D004905/Q000187;D004912;D005947/Q000494;D006461/Q000187;D006801;D010710/Q000494;D012965/Q000494	Adenine/pharmacology;Blood Preservation/methods;Carnitine/pharmacology;Citrates/pharmacology;Cryopreservation;Erythrocyte Aging/drug effects;Erythrocytes;Glucose/pharmacology;Hemolysis/drug effects;Humans;Phosphates/pharmacology;Sodium Chloride/pharmacology	Arduini A;Holme S;Sweeney JD;Dottori S;Sciarroni AF;Calvani M	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red cell	True
574	9164668	Copper-specific damage in human erythrocytes exposed to oxidative stress.	Ascorbate and complexes of Cu(II) and Fe(III) are capable of generating significant levels of oxygen free radicals. Exposure of erythrocytes to such oxidative stress leads to increased levels of methemoglobin and extensive changes in cell morphology. Cu(II) per mole is much more effective than Fe(III). However, isolated hemoglobin is oxidized more rapidly and completely by Fe(III)- than by Cu(II)-complexes. Both Fe(III) and Cu(II) are capable of inhibiting a number of the key enzymes of erythrocyte metabolism. The mechanism for the enhanced activity of Cu(II) has not been previously established. Using intact erythrocytes and hemolysates we demonstrate that Cu(II)-, but not Fe(III)-complexes in the presence of ascorbate block NADH-methemoglobin reductase. Complexes of Cu(II) alone are not inhibitory. The relative inability of Fe(III)-complexes and ascorbate to cause methemoglobin accumulation is not owing to Fe(III) association with the membrane, or its failure to enter the erythrocytes. The toxicity of Cu(II) and ascorbate appears to be a result of site-specific oxidative damage of erythrocyte NADH-methemoglobin reductase and the enzyme's subsequent inability to reduce the oxidized hemoglobin.	eng	231	240	Biological trace element research	56	2	1997	Feb		D003300/Q000009;D003300/Q000097;D003300/Q000633;D042966/Q000097;D042966/Q000187;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D006454/Q000737;D006454/Q000187;D006461/Q000187;D006801;D008706/Q000737;D008706/Q000187;D018384/Q000187;D018384/Q000502	Copper/adverse effects;Copper/blood;Copper/toxicity;Cytochrome-B(5) Reductase/blood;Cytochrome-B(5) Reductase/drug effects;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemoglobins/chemistry;Hemoglobins/drug effects;Hemolysis/drug effects;Humans;Methemoglobin/chemistry;Methemoglobin/drug effects;Oxidative Stress/drug effects;Oxidative Stress/physiology	Clopton DA;Saltman P	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
575	9028305	Identification of the cDNA for human red blood cell-specific hexokinase isozyme.	A unique cDNA for hexokinase (HK) was identified from poly(A)+ RNA of human reticulocytes by anchored polymerase chain reaction. This appeared to represent the cDNA for the red blood cell (RBC)-specific HK isozyme (HKR) described in our previous study (Murakami et al: Blood 75:770, 1990). Its nucleotide sequence was identical to HKI cDNA except for the 5' extreme end. It lacked the first 62 nucleotides of the HKI coding region: instead, it contained a unique sequence of 60 nucleotides at the beginning of the coding sequence as well as another unique sequence upstream of the putative translation initiation site. It lacked the porin-binding domain which facilitates binding to the mitochondria, thus explaining the exclusive cytoplasmic localization of HKR. It was the major cDNA derived from reticulocytes, consistent with the observation that HKR activity is predominant in reticulocytes. Northern blot analysis showed that it was expressed in the reticulocytes and in the K562 erythroleukemic cell line, but not in a lymphocytic cell line. In the extract of K562 cells, HKR activity co-eluted with the HKR of human RBCs on a MonoQ column (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) chromatography, using a salt gradient elution. The separate genetic control of the RBC-specific HK isozyme explains the clinical reports of two types of HK deficiency, one in which the HK activity was reduced exclusively in the RBC (HKR defect) and another with general decrease of HK activity in several tissues (HKI defect).	eng	762	766	Blood	89	3	1997	Feb	01	D000595;D001483;D018076/Q000097;D018076/Q000302;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006593/Q000097;D006593/Q000235;D006593/Q000302;D006801;D007527/Q000097;D007527/Q000235;D007527/Q000302;D004915/Q000201;D004915/Q000235;D008969;D012333/Q000096;D012156/Q000201;D012156/Q000378;D014407	Amino Acid Sequence;Base Sequence;DNA, Complementary/blood;DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hexokinase/blood;Hexokinase/genetics;Hexokinase/isolation & purification;Humans;Isoenzymes/blood;Isoenzymes/genetics;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology;Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics;Molecular Sequence Data;RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis;Reticulocytes/enzymology;Reticulocytes/metabolism;Tumor Cells, Cultured	Murakami K;Piomelli S	Journal, Articles							Erythro;Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;RBC	True
576	9279204	Transport of L-arginine and the nitric oxide inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine in human erythrocytes in chronic renal failure.	1. Transport of L-arginine and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors NG-monomethyl-L-arginine and NG-nitro-L-arginine was investigated in human erythrocytes from healthy donors and uraemic patients on haemodialysis. 2. Although K(m) values for total L-arginine influx were not significantly different in erythrocytes freshly isolated from controls or uraemic patients, uraemia was associated with an increase in the Vmax for transport (826 compared with 1176 mumol h-1 l-1 of cells) which was reduced to control values after dialysis. 3. Saturable influx of L-arginine was mediated by the classical cationic amino acid transport system y+ and system y+L, known to transport cationic and neutral amino acids with higher affinity. 4. Under zero-trans conditions, the Vmax for L-arginine transport via system y+increased from 271 to 700 mumol h-1 l-1 of cells in uraemia, while K(m) values increased from 44 to 94 mumol/l. Dialysis had no significant effect on the kinetic parameters altered by uraemia. 5. Under zero-trans conditions, and with system y+ inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (0.2 mmol/l), transport of L-arginine via system y+L was unaffected by uraemia. 6. Saturable influx of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine was also mediated by systems y+ (K(m) = 56 mumol/l, Vmax = 353 mumol h-1 l-1 of cells) and y+L (K(m) = 17 mumol/l, Vmax = 51.3 mumol h-1 l-1 of cells) and, as with L-arginine, uraemia increased the transport capacity for NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. 7. Influx of the neutral nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine was not readily saturable. 8. Intracellular concentrations of L-arginine and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine were significantly increased in erythrocytes from uraemic patients when compared with controls, consistent with an increased transport capacity for L-arginine and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. 9. The present study provides evidence that system y+ mediates the increased transport of L-arginine and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine in human erythrocytes from patients with chronic renal failure. Our findings may have implications for the activity of the L-arginine-nitric oxide signalling pathway in vascular endothelial and smooth-muscle cells in uraemia.	eng	57	64	Clinical science (London, England : 1979)	93	1	1997	Jul		D000328;D001120/Q000378;D001692;D002851;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D007676/Q000097;D008297;D008875;D019001/Q000037;D019335/Q000378;D006435;D014511/Q000097;D019323/Q000378	Adult;Arginine/metabolism;Biological Transport;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Kidney Failure, Chronic/blood;Male;Middle Aged;Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors;Nitroarginine/metabolism;Renal Dialysis;Uremia/blood;omega-N-Methylarginine/metabolism	Mendes Ribeiro AC;Hanssen H;Kiessling K;Roberts NB;Mann GE;Ellory JC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
577	9211878	Quaternary structure regulates hemin dissociation from human hemoglobin.	Rate constants for hemin dissociation from the alpha and beta subunits of native and recombinant human hemoglobins were measured as a function of protein concentration at pH 7.0, 37 degrees C, using H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin as a hemin acceptor reagent. Hemin dissociation rates were also measured for native isolated alpha and beta chains and for recombinant hemoglobin tetramers stabilized by alpha subunit fusion. The rate constant for hemin dissociation from beta subunits in native hemoglobin increases from 1.5 h-1 in tetramers at high protein concentration to 15 h-1 in dimers at low concentrations. The rate of hemin dissociation from alpha subunits in native hemoglobin is significantly smaller (0.3-0.6 h-1) and shows little dependence on protein concentration. Recombinant hemoglobins containing a fused di-alpha subunit remain tetrameric under all concentrations and show rates of hemin loss similar to those observed for wild-type and native hemoglobin at high protein concentration. Rates of hemin dissociation from monomeric alpha and beta chains are much greater, 12 and 40 h-1, respectively, at pH 7, 37 degrees C. Aggregation of monomers to form alpha1beta1 dimers greatly stabilizes bound hemin in alpha chains, decreasing its rate of hemin loss approximately 20-fold. In contrast, dimer formation has little stabilizing effect on hemin binding to beta subunits. A significant reduction in the rate of hemin loss from beta subunits does occur after formation of the alpha1beta2 interface in tetrameric hemoglobin. These results suggest that native human hemoglobin may have evolved to lose heme rapidly after red cell lysis, allowing the prosthetic group to be removed by serum albumin and apohemopexin.	eng	17385	17389	The Journal of biological chemistry	272	28	1997	Jul	11	D006427/Q000378;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008958;D010833/Q000378;D011487;D011489;D011994/Q000378;D013329;D013997	Hemin/metabolism;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Models, Molecular;Phytic Acid/metabolism;Protein Conformation;Protein Denaturation;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Structure-Activity Relationship;Time Factors	Hargrove MS;Whitaker T;Olson JS;Vali RJ;Mathews AJ	Journal, Articles							red cell	True
578	9218461	Molecular cloning of human plasma membrane phospholipid scramblase. A protein mediating transbilayer movement of plasma membrane phospholipids.	"The rapid movement of phospholipids (PL) between plasma membrane leaflets in response to increased intracellular Ca2+ is thought to play a key role in expression of platelet procoagulant activity and in clearance of injured or apoptotic cells. We recently reported isolation of a approximately 37-kDa protein in erythrocyte membrane that mediates Ca2+-dependent movement of PL between membrane leaflets, similar to that observed upon elevation of Ca2+ in the cytosol (Bassé, F., Stout, J. G., Sims, P. J., and Wiedmer, T. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 17205-17210). Based on internal peptide sequence obtained from this protein, a 1,445-base pair cDNA was cloned from a K-562 cDNA library. The deduced ""PL scramblase"" protein is a proline-rich, type II plasma membrane protein with a single transmembrane segment near the C terminus. Antibody against the deduced C-terminal peptide was found to precipitate the approximately 37-kDa red blood cell protein and absorb PL scramblase activity, confirming the identity of the cloned cDNA to erythrocyte PL scramblase. Ca2+-dependent PL scramblase activity was also demonstrated in recombinant protein expressed from plasmid containing the cDNA. Quantitative immunoblotting revealed an approximately 10-fold higher abundance of PL scramblase in platelet ( approximately 10(4) molecules/cell) than in erythrocyte ( approximately 10(3) molecules/cell), consistent with apparent increased PL scramblase activity of the platelet plasma membrane. PL scramblase mRNA was found in a variety of hematologic and nonhematologic cells and tissues, suggesting that this protein functions in all cells."	eng	18240	18244	The Journal of biological chemistry	272	29	1997	Jul	18	D000595;D001483;D002352/Q000096;D002352/Q000737;D002352/Q000378;D003001/Q000379;D017931;D004910/Q000378;D018922/Q000201;D006367/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008051/Q000378;D008563/Q000097;D008565/Q000096;D008565/Q000737;D008565/Q000378;D008969;D049294;D016133;D011994/Q000096;D011994/Q000737;D011994/Q000378;D014407	Amino Acid Sequence;Base Sequence;Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis;Carrier Proteins/chemistry;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cloning, Molecular/methods;DNA Primers;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;HL-60 Cells/enzymology;HeLa Cells/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Lipid Bilayers/metabolism;Membrane Lipids/blood;Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis;Membrane Proteins/chemistry;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Phospholipid Transfer Proteins;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis;Recombinant Proteins/chemistry;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Tumor Cells, Cultured	Zhou Q;Zhao J;Stout JG;Luhm RA;Wiedmer T;Sims PJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
579	9166863	Human erythrocytes express GLUT5 and transport fructose.	Although erythrocytes readily metabolize fructose, it has not been known how this sugar gains entry to the red blood cell. We present evidence indicating that human erythrocytes express the fructose transporter GLUT5, which is the major means for transporting fructose into the cell. Immunoblotting and immunolocalization experiments identified the presence of GLUT1 and GLUT5 as the main facilitative hexose transporters expressed in human erythrocytes, with GLUT2 present in lower amounts. Functional studies allowed the identification of two transporters with different kinetic properties involved in the transport of fructose in human erythrocytes. The predominant transporter (GLUT5) showed an apparent Km for fructose of approximately 10 mmol/L. Transport of low concentrations of fructose was not affected by 2-deoxy-D-glucose, a glucose analog that is transported by GLUT1 and GLUT2. Similarly, cytochalasin B, a potent inhibitor of the functional activity of GLUT1 and GLUT2, did not affect the transport of fructose in human erythrocytes. The functional properties of the fructose transporter present in human erythrocytes are consistent with a central role for GLUT5 as the physiological transporter of fructose in these cells.	eng	4190	4195	Blood	89	11	1997	Jun	01	D001692;D004912/Q000378;D005632/Q000378;D051272;D051273;D051296;D006801;D007150;D009004/Q000096;D009004/Q000378	Biological Transport;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fructose/metabolism;Glucose Transporter Type 1;Glucose Transporter Type 2;Glucose Transporter Type 5;Humans;Immunohistochemistry;Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/biosynthesis;Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/metabolism	Concha II;Velásquez FV;Martínez JM;Angulo C;Droppelmann A;Reyes AM;Slebe JC;Vera JC;Golde DW	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
580	9169423	Interaction of the erythrocyte lactate transporter (monocarboxylate transporter 1) with an integral 70-kDa membrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily.	Treatment of intact erythrocytes with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonate (DIDS) causes irreversible inhibition and chemical labeling of the lactate transporter, monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) (Poole, R. C., and Halestrap, A. P. (1992) Biochem. J. 283, 855-862). In rat erythrocytes DIDS also causes cross-linking of MCT1 to another protein in the membrane to give a product of 130 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cross-linking is markedly reduced by those compounds that protect against irreversible inhibition of lactate transport by DIDS and enhanced by imposition of a pH gradient across the plasma membrane to recruit the substrate binding site of MCT1 to an exofacial conformation. These data indicate that DIDS cross-linking is via the same site on MCT1 as is responsible for inhibition of transport. Antibodies raised against the cross-linked conjugate react with proteins of approximately 40 kDa (MCT1) and 70 kDa on Western blots of erythrocyte membranes and an additional band of 130 kDa after treatment of erythrocytes with 100 microM DIDS. The 70-kDa protein that is cross-linked to MCT1 was purified and shown to contain N-linked carbohydrate; the apparent core molecular mass is 40 kDa. Amino acid sequencing showed that the protein is the rat equivalent of the membrane-spanning mouse teratocarcinoma glycoprotein GP-70, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily related to basigin (Ozawa, M., Huang, R. P., Furukawa, T. , and Muramatsu, T. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 3059-3062). Possible implications of the specific interaction between MCT1 and this protein are discussed.	eng	14624	14628	The Journal of biological chemistry	272	23	1997	Jun	06	D017878/Q000494;D000595;D000818;D002352/Q000097;D002352/Q000187;D003432;D019281;D004910/Q000378;D007136/Q000737;D007700;D008562/Q000097;D008562/Q000737;D008562/Q000302;D051379;D008969;D008970;D027501;D010446/Q000737;D051381;D016415;D017386;D013724;D014357	4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid/pharmacology;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Carrier Proteins/blood;Carrier Proteins/drug effects;Cross-Linking Reagents;Dimerization;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Immunoglobulins/chemistry;Kinetics;Membrane Glycoproteins/blood;Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry;Membrane Glycoproteins/isolation & purification;Mice;Molecular Sequence Data;Molecular Weight;Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters;Peptide Fragments/chemistry;Rats;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Teratoma;Trypsin	Poole RC;Halestrap AP	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

582	9159180	Na,K-ATPase subunit isoforms in human reticulocytes: evidence from reverse transcription-PCR for the presence of alpha1, alpha3, beta2, beta3, and gamma.	The objective of this study has been to determine which Na,K-ATPase isoforms are expressed in red blood cells and whether kinetic differences in the uncoupled sodium efflux mode between the human red blood cell Na,K-ATPase and other preparations can be explained by differences in the underlying subunit composition. To this end, human reticulocyte RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, amplified by PCR and appropriate primers, and sequenced. Primers from highly conserved areas as well as isoform-specific primers were used. The alpha1 and alpha3 isoforms of the alpha subunit, and the beta2 and beta3 isoforms of the beta subunit were found. The complete coding regions of the cDNAs for the reticulocyte subunits were sequenced from overlapping PCR fragments. No difference was found between the reticulocyte isoforms and the ones already known. The fact that we found beta2 but not beta1 in reticulocyte single-stranded cDNA, and beta1 but not beta2 in a leukocyte library indicates that leukocyte contamination of our reticulocyte preparation was negligible. Analysis of a human bone marrow library showed that alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3 as well as all three beta isoforms were present. The extent to which the kinetic properties of uncoupled sodium efflux might depend on different isoform combinations is not yet known.	eng	5943	5948	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	94	11	1997	May	27	D001483;D001853;D017931;D018076;D015723;D006412/Q000201;D006801;D007527/Q000097;D007527/Q000737;D007962/Q000201;D046911;D016133;D012156/Q000201;D000254/Q000097;D000254/Q000737	Base Sequence;Bone Marrow;DNA Primers;DNA, Complementary;Gene Library;Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology;Humans;Isoenzymes/blood;Isoenzymes/chemistry;Leukocytes/enzymology;Macromolecular Substances;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Reticulocytes/enzymology;Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/blood;Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/chemistry	Stengelin MK;Hoffman JF	Journal, Articles							red blood cell	True
583	9357764	Effects of PKC alpha activation on Ca2+ pump and K(Ca) channel in deoxygenated sickle cells.	We have previously shown that a pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), reduced deoxygenation-induced K+ loss and Ca2+ uptake and prevented cell dehydration in sickle anemia red blood cells (SS cells) (H. Fathallah, E. Coezy, R.-S. De Neef, M.-D. Hardy-Dessources, and F. Giraud. Blood 86: 1999-2007, 1995). The present study explores the detailed mechanism of this PMA-induced inhibition. The main findings are, first, the detection of PKC alpha and PKC zeta in normal red blood cells and the demonstration that both isoforms are expressed at higher levels in SS cells. The alpha-isoform only is translocated to the membrane and activated by PMA and by elevation of cytosolic Ca2+. Second, PMA is demonstrated to activate Ca2+ efflux in deoxygenated SS cells by a direct stimulation of the Ca2+ pump. PMA, moreover, inhibits deoxygenation-induced, charybdotoxin-sensitive K+ efflux in SS cells. This inhibition is partly indirect and explained by the reduced deoxygenation-induced rise in cytosolic Ca2+ resulting from Ca2+ pump stimulation. However, a significant inhibition of the Ca2+-activated K+ channels (K(Ca) channels) by PMA can also be demonstrated when the channels are activated by Ca2+ plus ionophore, under conditions in which the Ca2+ pump is operating near its maximal extrusion rate, but swamped by Ca2+ plus ionophore. The data thus suggest a PKC alpha-mediated phosphorylation both of the Ca2+ pump and of the K(Ca) channel or an auxiliary protein.	eng	C1206	C1214	The American journal of physiology	273	4	1997	Oct		D000755/Q000097;D000755/Q000201;D016718/Q000494;D000001/Q000494;D002118/Q000097;D002118/Q000494;D000252/Q000097;D002848;D003600/Q000378;D004075/Q000494;D004533/Q000494;D004789;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D066298;D007527/Q000097;D007527/Q000302;D007700;D008970;D011493/Q000097;D011493/Q000302;D051571;D012016;D013755/Q000494	Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood;Anemia, Sickle Cell/enzymology;Arachidonic Acid/pharmacology;Calcimycin/pharmacology;Calcium/blood;Calcium/pharmacology;Calcium-Transporting ATPases/blood;Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose;Cytosol/metabolism;Diglycerides/pharmacology;Egtazic Acid/pharmacology;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Isoenzymes/blood;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;Protein Kinase C/blood;Protein Kinase C/isolation & purification;Protein Kinase C-alpha;Reference Values;Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology	Fathallah H;Sauvage M;Romero JR;Canessa M;Giraud F	Journal, Articles					10.1152/ajpcell.1997.273.4.C1206		Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
584	9315607	Manganese transport through human erythrocyte membranes. An EPR study.	Manganese uptake by human erythrocytes was investigated in the concentration range 0.5-20 mM in the suspending solution, by using the EPR technique. S shaped dependencies of manganese influx on manganese doping solution concentration for both fresh and vanadate treated erythrocytes were found, with maximum influx values of 4.1 +/- 1.9 x 10(-10) mol/m2 x s and 2.1 +/- 0.3 x 10(-9) mol/m2 x s, respectively. At low manganese concentrations (< 2 mM) the manganese permeability coefficient increases with increasing the doping concentration, the ions cooperate for achieving a transport event. For high manganese concentration (> 5 mM) the permeability coefficient decreases with increasing the doping concentration, the ions competing for the limited amount of transport system. A similar increase in manganese uptake as in vanadate treated erythrocytes was measured for 'in vitro' aged erythrocytes. These results might suggest that human erythrocytes possess an active transport mechanism by which, they oppose to manganese influx. This hypothesis is also supported by the 10-15 min time lag between the moment of doping and the start of the manganese influx into the fresh erythrocytes. The manganese uptake inhibition by nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, for the case of vanadate treated erythrocytes, suggests that, at least partially, manganese uptake by the cells occurs via the 'calcium channels'.	eng	90	98	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1328	2	1997	Sep	04	D001693/Q000187;D002121/Q000494;D015220/Q000378;D002463;D004058;D004578/Q000379;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000187;D006801;D008345/Q000378;D008956;D009543/Q000494;D014638/Q000494	Biological Transport, Active/drug effects;Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology;Calcium Channels/metabolism;Cell Membrane Permeability;Diffusion;Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy/methods;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Humans;Manganese/metabolism;Models, Chemical;Nifedipine/pharmacology;Vanadates/pharmacology	Lucaciu CM;Dragu C;Copăescu L;Morariu VV	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
585	9283087	Binding characterization of a putative cGMP transporter in the cell membrane of human erythrocytes.	Cyclic GMP is an intracellular signal molecule whose biological and pharmacological role is not well understood. Recent studies with human erythrocytes and other cell types (normal and transformed) have shown that the extrusion of cGMP is an ATP-dependent and saturable process. In this paper, we present our studies on binding of [3H]-cGMP to human erythrocyte ghost and its solubilized extracts. At 4 degrees C, an apparent dissociation constant of 0.15 microM was found in the samples. Maximum specific binding values in ghost and solubilized extracts were 9.0 pmol/mg of protein and 1.0 pmol/mg of protein, respectively. The low dissociation constant was confirmed by kinetic studies with a value of 0.16 microM. Specific [3H]-cGMP binding was inhibited by cAMP, cGMP, and cIMP with KD values of 0.22 microM, 0.09 microM, and 0.17 microM, respectively. Unlabeled cGMP and cIMP inhibited [3H]-cGMP binding completely whereas cAMP inhibited only 70%. The membrane-localized cGMP-binding protein discriminates between cyclic and noncyclic nucleotides, since GMP, IMP, and AMP were unable to displace [3H]-cGMP. A zwitterionic detergent, CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfate), was able to solubilize a protein with identical binding affinity. The results of this study show that erythrocyte ghosts possess a cGMP-binding protein which is not a kinase (due to a similar affinity for cAMP, cGMP, and cIMP) or phosphodiesterase (due to the inability of IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, to inhibit specific [3H]-cGMP binding). We hypothesize that this protein is the cell membrane cGMP transporter.	eng	10954	10958	Biochemistry	36	36	1997	Sep	09	D001665;D002352/Q000737;D002352/Q000378;D006152/Q000378;D004910/Q000737;D004910/Q000378;D006801	Binding Sites;Carrier Proteins/chemistry;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cyclic GMP/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/chemistry;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans	Boadu E;Sager G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

587	9605565	Ribavirin uptake by human erythrocytes and the involvement of nitrobenzylthioinosine-sensitive (es)-nucleoside transporters.	1. The major toxicity associated with oral therapy with ribavirin is anaemia, which has been postulated to occur as a result of accumulation of ribavirin triphosphate interfering with erythrocyte respiration. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism by which ribavirin enters into erythrocytes. 2. Entry into human erythrocytes was examined by measuring influx rates of [3H]-ribavirin alone and with the inhibitor nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), and by investigating the inhibitory effects of nucleoside and nucleobase permeants on ribavirin transport, by use of inhibitor oil-stop methods. Transport mechanisms were further characterized by assessment of substrates to cause countertransport of ribavirin in preloaded erythrocytes, and by measuring the effects of ribavirin on [3H]-NBMPR binding to erythrocyte membranes. 3. Human erythrocytes had a saturable influx mechanism for ribavirin (Km at 22 degrees C of 440+/-100 microM) which was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of NBMPR (IC50 0.99+/-0.15 nM). Nucleosides also inhibited the influx of ribavirin (adenosine more effective than uridine) but the nucleobases hypoxanthine and adenine had no effect. In addition, uridine caused the countertransport of ribavirin in human erythrocytes. Entry of ribavirin into horse erythrocytes, a cell type that lacks the NBMPR-sensitive (es) nucleoside transporter, proceeded slowly and via a pathway that was resistant to NBMPR inhibition. Ribavirin was a competitive inhibitor of adenosine influx (mean Ki 0.48+/-0.14 mM) and also inhibited NBMPR binding to erythrocyte membranes (mean Ki 2.2+/-0.39 mM). 4. These data indicate that ribavirin is a transported permeant for the es nucleoside transporter of human erythrocytes. There was no evidence for ribavirin entering cells via a nucleobase transporter.	eng	1587	1592	British journal of pharmacology	123	8	1998	Apr		D000241/Q000378;D000818;D000998/Q000097;D002352/Q000378;D033722;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006736;D006801;D066298;D008565/Q000378;D012254/Q000097;D013868/Q000031;D013868/Q000378;D014529/Q000097	Adenosine/metabolism;Animals;Antiviral Agents/blood;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Equilibrative-Nucleoside Transporter 2;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Horses;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Ribavirin/blood;Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives;Thioinosine/metabolism;Uridine/blood	Jarvis SM;Thorn JA;Glue P	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
588	9525951	Evidence for the presence of aquaporin-3 in human red blood cells.	A facilitated diffusion for glycerol is present in human erythrocytes. Glycerol transporters identified to date belong to the Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP) family of integral membrane proteins, and one of them, aquaporin-3 (AQP3), has been characterized in mammals. Using an antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to the rat AQP3 carboxyl terminus, we examined the presence of AQP3 in normal and Colton-null (aquaporin-1 (AQP1)-deficient) human erythrocytes. Three immunoreactive bands were detected on immunoblots of both normal and Colton-null red cells, very similar to the bands revealed in rat kidney, a material in which AQP3 has been extensively studied. By immunofluorescence, anti-AQP3 antibodies stained the plasma membranes of both normal and Colton-null erythrocytes. Glycerol transport was measured on intact erythrocytes by stopped-flow light scattering and on one-step pink ghosts by a rapid filtration technique. Glycerol permeability values, similar in both cell types, suggest that AQP1 does not represent the major path for glycerol movement across red blood cell membranes. Furthermore, pharmacological studies showed that Colton-null red cells remain sensitive to water and glycerol flux inhibitors, supporting the idea that another proteinaceous path, probably AQP3, mediates most of the glycerol movements across red cell membranes and represents part of the residual water transport activity found in AQP1-deficient red cells.	eng	8407	8412	The Journal of biological chemistry	273	14	1998	Apr	03	D000818;D051400;D020346;D001692;D004912/Q000378;D005990/Q000378;D006801;D007473/Q000378;D051381;D014867/Q000378	Animals;Aquaporin 3;Aquaporins;Biological Transport;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycerol/metabolism;Humans;Ion Channels/metabolism;Rats;Water/metabolism	Roudier N;Verbavatz JM;Maurel C;Ripoche P;Tacnet F	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
589	9531554	The 13-kD FK506 binding protein, FKBP13, interacts with a novel homologue of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeletal protein 4.1.	We have identified a novel generally expressed homologue of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeletal protein 4.1, named 4.1G, based on the interaction of its COOH-terminal domain (CTD) with the immunophilin FKBP13. The 129-amino acid peptide, designated 4.1G-CTD, is the first known physiologic binding target of FKBP13. FKBP13 is a 13-kD protein originally identified by its high affinity binding to the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and rapamycin (Jin, Y., M.W. Albers, W.S. Lane, B.E. Bierer, and S.J. Burakoff. 1991. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 88:6677- 6681); it is a membrane-associated protein thought to function as an ER chaperone (Bush, K.T., B.A. Henrickson, and S.K. Nigam. 1994. Biochem. J. [Tokyo]. 303:705-708). We report the specific association of FKBP13 with 4.1G-CTD based on yeast two-hybrid, in vitro binding and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The histidyl-proline moiety of 4.1G-CTD is required for FKBP13 binding, as indicated by yeast experiments with truncated and mutated 4.1G-CTD constructs. In situ hybridization studies reveal cellular colocalizations for FKBP13 and 4.1G-CTD throughout the body during development, supporting a physiologic role for the interaction. Interestingly, FKBP13 cofractionates with the red blood cell homologue of 4.1 (4.1R) in ghosts, inside-out vesicles, and Triton shell preparations. The identification of FKBP13 in erythrocytes, which lack ER, suggests that FKBP13 may additionally function as a component of membrane cytoskeletal scaffolds.	eng	143	153	The Journal of cell biology	141	1	1998	Apr	06	D000375/Q000378;D000595;D000818;D001665;D001921/Q000196;D001921/Q000254;D001921/Q000378;D002352/Q000096;D002352/Q000737;D002352/Q000378;D003001;D003598;D004268;D004910/Q000378;D005656/Q000378;D018507;D015723;D006624/Q000378;D008565/Q000096;D008565/Q000737;D008565/Q000378;D008969;D009479;D009928;D051381;D017207;D011993/Q000737;D011993/Q000378;D012441;D029701;D016415;D017386;D016559/Q000378;D022021;D014157	Aging/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Binding Sites;Brain/embryology;Brain/growth & development;Brain/metabolism;Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis;Carrier Proteins/chemistry;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cloning, Molecular;Cytoskeletal Proteins;DNA-Binding Proteins;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Fungal Proteins/metabolism;Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental;Gene Library;Hippocampus/metabolism;Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis;Membrane Proteins/chemistry;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Neuropeptides;Organ Specificity;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry;Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Tacrolimus/metabolism;Tacrolimus Binding Proteins;Transcription Factors	Walensky LD;Gascard P;Fields ME;Blackshaw S;Conboy JG;Mohandas N;Snyder SH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
590	9553068	Transport and metabolism of the essential vitamin pantothenic acid in human erythrocytes infected with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.	The growth of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, within its host erythrocyte is reliant on the uptake of a number of essential nutrients from the extracellular medium. One of these is pantothenic acid, a water-soluble vitamin that is a precursor of coenzyme A. In this study we show that normal uninfected erythrocytes are impermeable to pantothenate but that the vitamin is taken up rapidly into malaria-infected cells via a transport pathway that has the characteristics (furosemide sensitivity, nonsaturability) of previously characterized, broad specificity permeation pathways induced by the intracellular parasite in the host cell membrane. The transport of pantothenate therefore constitutes a critical physiological role for these pathways. Inside the parasitized cell pantothenate undergoes phosphorylation, the first step in its conversion to coenzyme A. Parasites within saponin-permeabilized erythrocytes were shown to take up and phosphorylate pantothenate, consistent with the intracellular parasite having both a pantothenate transporter and a pantothenate kinase. Comparisons of the rate of phosphorylation of pantothenate by lysates prepared from uninfected and infected erythrocytes revealed that the pantothenate kinase activity of the P. falciparum trophozoite is some 10-fold higher than that of its host cell and that most, if not all, of the phosphorylation of pantothenate within the malaria-infected cell occurs within the intracellular parasite. These results contrast with those of previous studies in which it was proposed that the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium lophurae lacks pantothenate kinase (as well as the other enzymes for the synthesis of coenzyme A) and is reliant upon the uptake of preformed coenzyme A from the host cell cytosol.	eng	10190	10195	The Journal of biological chemistry	273	17	1998	Apr	24	D000818;D001692;D002457;D004305;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000469;D005665/Q000494;D006801;D010205/Q000378;D010766;D010963/Q000378;D012503	Animals;Biological Transport;Cell Extracts;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Furosemide/pharmacology;Humans;Pantothenic Acid/metabolism;Phosphorylation;Plasmodium falciparum/metabolism;Saponins	Saliba KJ;Horner HA;Kirk K	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

We isolated a 40 kDa integral membrane protein (p40) from human erythrocyte ghosts by affinity chromatography, using a C-terminal peptide of stomatin, and obtained partial sequences which enabled us to isolate two full-length cDNAs from human bone marrow and fetal brain cDNA libraries. The cDNA sequences were identical and encoded a novel putative G protein-coupled receptor (399 amino acids). Northern and RNA dot blot analyses demonstrated that the major 4.8 kb-transcript is predominantly expressed in brain.

592	9581022	Selective uptake of selenite by red blood cells.	Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium (Se) can be utilized in the body, and the biotransformation of selenite into an organic form of Se in the bloodstream is the first step for the utilization of inorganic Se. Selenite injected intravenously into rats was shown to be taken up rapidly and selectively by red blood cells (RBCs) through the anion-exchange carrier. The uptake of selenite by RBCs was inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbene disulfonate, a specific inhibitor of the anion-exchange carrier (band 3 protein). The uptake was also inhibited by chromate owing to the glutathione deprivation in RBCs, which was confirmed by the inhibition by azodicarboxylic acid bis(dimethylamide). The presence of hydrogencarbonate in the incubation solution slightly retarded the uptake of selenite by RBCs. Although Se effluxed into the plasma was bound selectively to albumin, plasma proteins (albumin) did not accelerate the uptake process. Based on these results, the rapid and selective uptake of selenite by RBCs was explained by the selective and efficient uptake through the anion-exchange carrier, followed by reduction by glutathione.	eng	63	67	The Analyst	123	1	1998	Jan		D000818;D001457/Q000378;D002478;D002840/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005978/Q000378;D008297;D013058;D051381;D017208;D018038/Q000378	Animals;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Cells, Cultured;Chromates/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glutathione/metabolism;Male;Mass Spectrometry;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Sodium Selenite/metabolism	Suzuki KT;Shiobara Y;Itoh M;Ohmichi M	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
593	9405334	Ascorbate function and metabolism in the human erythrocyte.	Ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, is an important antioxidant in plasma, where it consumes oxygen free radicals and helps to preserve alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) in lipoproteins. Erythrocytes, as the most plentiful cell in blood, help to preserve ascorbate in the blood plasma. In contrast to nucleated cells, which avidly concentrate ascorbate, the erythrocyte ascorbate concentration is the same as that in plasma. Erythrocytes nonetheless have a high capacity to regenerate the vitamin from its two electron-oxidized form, dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). DHA is rapidly taken up by these cells on the abundant glucose transport protein, GLUT1. Intracellular DHA is rapidly reduced to ascorbate by GSH in a direct chemical reaction, although enzyme-dependent mechanisms involving both glutaredoxin and thioredoxin reductase have also been demonstrated. Ascorbate, which carries a negative charge at physiologic pH, enters and leaves the cells slowly. Nonetheless, this slow release of ascorbate from erythrocytes can preserve both the plasma concentration of the vitamin, and prevent oxidation of alpha-tocopherol in low-density lipoprotein. In addition, intracellular ascorbate can spare and possibly recycle alpha-tocopherol in the erythrocyte membrane. In turn, alpha-tocopherol protects the cell membrane from lipid peroxidation. The ability of erythrocytes to recycle ascorbate, coupled with the ability of ascorbate to protect alpha-tocopherol in the cell membrane and in lipoproteins, provides a potentially important mechanism for preventing lipid peroxidative damage in areas of inflammation in the vascular bed, such as those involved with atherosclerosis.	eng	d1	d10	Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library	3		1998	Jan	01	D000975/Q000378;D001205/Q000378;D001205/Q000502;D003683/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005292/Q000737;D005978/Q000378;D006801;D008054/Q000378;D010084;D018384/Q000187;D024502/Q000378	Antioxidants/metabolism;Ascorbic Acid/metabolism;Ascorbic Acid/physiology;Dehydroascorbic Acid/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Ferricyanides/chemistry;Glutathione/metabolism;Humans;Lipid Peroxides/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress/drug effects;alpha-Tocopherol/metabolism	May JM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
594	9448716	Protection and recycling of alpha-tocopherol in human erythrocytes by intracellular ascorbic acid.	Ascorbic acid can recycle alpha-tocopherol from the tocopheroxyl free radical in lipid bilayers and in micelles, but such recycling has not been demonstrated to occur across cell membranes. In this work the ability of intracellular ascorbate to protect and to recycle alpha-tocopherol in intact human erythrocytes and erythrocyte ghosts was investigated. In erythrocytes that were 80% depleted of intracellular ascorbate by treatment with the nitroxide Tempol, both 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) and ferricyanide oxidized alpha-tocopherol to a greater extent than in cells not depleted of ascorbate. In contrast, in erythrocytes in which the intracellular ascorbate concentration had been increased by loading with dehydroascorbate, loss of alpha-tocopherol was less with both oxidants than in control cells. Protection against AAPH-induced oxidation of alpha-tocopherol was not prevented by extracellular ascorbate oxidase, indicating that the protection was due to intracellular and not to extracellular ascorbate. Incubation of erythrocytes with lecithin liposomes also generated an oxidant stress, which caused lipid peroxidation in the liposomes and depleted erythrocyte alpha-tocopherol, leading to hemolysis. Ascorbate loading of the erythrocytes delayed liposome oxidation and decreased loss of alpha-tocopherol from both cells and from alpha-tocopherol-loaded liposomes. When erythrocyte ghosts were resealed to contain ascorbate and challenged with free radicals generated by AAPH outside the ghosts, intravesicular ascorbate was totally depleted over 1 h of incubation, whereas alpha-tocopherol decreased only after ascorbate was substantially oxidized. These results suggest that ascorbate within the erythrocyte protects alpha-tocopherol in the cell membrane by a direct recycling mechanism.	eng	281	289	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics	349	2	1998	Jan	15	D000578/Q000494;D000975/Q000494;D001205/Q000097;D003497/Q000494;D003683/Q000097;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005292/Q000494;D005978/Q000097;D006801;D007700;D008081;D016877/Q000494;D010084;D010713;D013113;D014810/Q000097;D014810/Q000737	Amidines/pharmacology;Antioxidants/pharmacology;Ascorbic Acid/blood;Cyclic N-Oxides/pharmacology;Dehydroascorbic Acid/blood;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Ferricyanides/pharmacology;Glutathione/blood;Humans;Kinetics;Liposomes;Oxidants/pharmacology;Oxidation-Reduction;Phosphatidylcholines;Spin Labels;Vitamin E/blood;Vitamin E/chemistry	May JM;Qu ZC;Mendiratta S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
595	9667500	Enzyme-dependent ascorbate recycling in human erythrocytes: role of thioredoxin reductase.	Human erythrocytes efficiently reduce dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) to ascorbate, which helps to maintain the ascorbate content of blood. Whereas erythrocyte DHA reduction is thought to occur primarily through a direct chemical reaction with GSH, this work addresses the role of enzyme-mediated DHA reduction by these cells. The ability of intact erythrocytes to recycle DHA to ascorbate, estimated as DHA-dependent ferricyanide reduction, was decreased in parallel with GSH depletion by glutathione-S-transferase substrates. In contrast, the sulfhydryl reagent phenylarsine oxide inhibited DHA reduction to a much greater extent than it decreased GSH in intact cells. DHA reduction in excess of that due to a direct chemical reaction with GSH was also observed in freshly prepared hemolysates. Hemolysates likewise showed NADPH-dependent reduction of DHA that appeared due to thioredoxin reductase, because this activity was inhibited 68% by 10 microM aurothioglucose, doubled by 5 microM E. coli thioredoxin, and had an apparent Km for DHA (1.5 mM) similar to that of purified thioredoxin reductase. Additionally, aurothioglucose-sensitive, NADPH-dependent DHA reductase activity was decreased 80% in hemolysates prepared from phenylarsine oxide-treated cells. GSH-dependent DHA reduction in hemolysates was more than 10-fold that of NADPH-dependent reduction. Nonetheless, the ability of phenylarsine oxide to decrease DHA reduction in intact cells with little effect on GSH suggests that enzymes, such as thioredoxin reductase, may contribute more to this activity than previously considered.	eng	221	228	Free radical biology & medicine	25	2	1998	Jul	15	D001152/Q000494;D001205/Q000378;D006051/Q000494;D002462/Q000737;D002474/Q000737;D002474/Q000187;D003683/Q000378;D004137/Q000494;D004305;D004798/Q000378;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D005292/Q000378;D005978/Q000187;D005978/Q000378;D005982/Q000378;D006461;D006801;D007659/Q000494;D009249/Q000494;D013880/Q000378;D013880/Q000502;D014810/Q000032	Arsenicals/pharmacology;Ascorbic Acid/metabolism;Aurothioglucose/pharmacology;Cell Membrane/chemistry;Cell-Free System/chemistry;Cell-Free System/drug effects;Dehydroascorbic Acid/metabolism;Dinitrochlorobenzene/pharmacology;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Enzymes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Ferricyanides/metabolism;Glutathione/drug effects;Glutathione/metabolism;Glutathione Transferase/metabolism;Hemolysis;Humans;Ketones/pharmacology;NADP/pharmacology;Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/metabolism;Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/physiology;Vitamin E/analysis	Mendiratta S;Qu ZC;May JM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
596	9701776	Human erythrocytes contain Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase which is involved in the hydrolysis of cGMP.	To determine whether phosphodiesterase (PDE) is involved in the degradation of cGMP in human erythrocytes, we studied the cell cGMP content in the presence of different PDE inhibitors: zaprinast and dipyridamole, specific inhibitors of cGMP-binding, cGMP-specific PDE (cG-BPDE); vinpocetine, a specific inhibitor of Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase (CaM-PDE); an unspecific inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). IBMX, zaprinast, and dipyridamole at 30 microM did not affect the intracellular cGMP content. However, vinpocetine at this concentration increased the cGMP content by 102 +/- 14% (p < 0.05). The effect of vinpocetine was dose-dependent, reached the maximal level after 1 min of incubation and flattened at the same level. Ca2+ (10 microM) in the presence of the Ca(2+)-ionophore, A23187 (5 microM), decreased the cGMP content (-23% +/- 4; p < 0.05), which can be explained by the CaM-PDE activation. The Ca(2+)-induced decrease in cGMP was completely inhibited by the CaM antagonist, W-7 (100 microM). These data suggest that erythrocytes contain Ca2+, CaM-PDE.	eng	387	393	Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology	20	5	1998	Jun		D015056/Q000494;D015106/Q000502;D002118/Q000502;D002147/Q000502;D006152/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006868;D010726/Q000494;D011688/Q000494;D013449/Q000494;D014748/Q000494	1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine/pharmacology;3',5'-Cyclic-GMP Phosphodiesterases/physiology;Calcium/physiology;Calmodulin/physiology;Cyclic GMP/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrolysis;Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology;Purinones/pharmacology;Sulfonamides/pharmacology;Vinca Alkaloids/pharmacology	Petrov V;Fagard R;Lijnen P	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
597	9785380	Production of prostaglandins E1 and E2 by adult human red blood cells.	We showed that human adult red blood cells (RBCs) produce prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and E2 (PGE2). RBCs that were mechanically stressed in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ by being injected rapidly through a fine needle produced PGE1 and PGE2 within 30 min after this mechanical stress. The amounts of PGE1 and PGE2 produced by 1 x 10(9) mechanically stressed RBCs were approximately 50 pg and 100 pg, respectively, which were determined in the cytosolic fraction from sonicated RBCs using a competitive enzyme immunoassay method. A Western blot analysis using anti-cyclooxygenase-2 antibody revealed a band at the 70-kDa position in the samples from RBCs producing PGE1 and PGE2. Treatment with 10 micrograms/mL indomethacin completely inhibited the productions of PGE1 and PGE2. The present results may indicate a new role of RBCs in microcirculation.	eng	89	101	Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators	56	2-3	1998	Jun		D000328;D000527/Q000096;D015153;D002118/Q000494;D016861/Q000494;D003600/Q000378;D015232/Q000096;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007124;D007213/Q000494;D007700;D013010;D013314	Adult;Alprostadil/biosynthesis;Blotting, Western;Calcium/pharmacology;Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology;Cytosol/metabolism;Dinoprostone/biosynthesis;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Immunoenzyme Techniques;Indomethacin/pharmacology;Kinetics;Sonication;Stress, Mechanical	Oonishi T;Sakashita K;Ishioka N;Suematsu N;Shio H;Uyesaka N	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
598	9651491	Evidence for a role of the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) in the outward translocation of NBD-phospholipids in the erythrocyte membrane.	Phosphatidylserine (PS) containing a 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl- (NBD-) hexanoyl residue, like native PS, preferentially distributes into the inner membrane leaflet of human erythrocytes. In the case of NBD-PS, this preference results from two opposite active processes, an inward translocation mediated by the aminophospholipid flippase and an outward translocation mediated by an ill-defined floppase. Selective inhibition of this floppase by alkylating reagents or cationic and anionic drugs increases the extent of accumulation of NBD-PS in the inner membrane leaflet from about 70% in control cells to about 90%. Different inhibitor sensitivities of the flippase and the floppase strongly suggest that both represent different entities. The floppase was characterized in further detail by comparing inhibitory effects of various compounds on this translocase with their effects on known primary active transport systems for amphiphilic compounds. The inhibitory effects of various drugs, glutathione conjugates and GSSG on the floppase activity closely correlate with those reported for the active transport by the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) while only poorly going parallel with those for the active transport by the low affinity pump for glutathione conjugates and the multidrug resistance MDR1 P-glycoprotein. The NBD-phospholipid floppase activity of the erythrocyte is thus probably a function of MRP.	eng	91	101	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1372	1	1998	Jun	24	D009327/Q000031;D009327/Q000378;D018528/Q000097;D018528/Q000502;D000477/Q000494;D001693/Q000187;D017301/Q000378;D002352/Q000187;D018432;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000201;D004910/Q000378;D005978/Q000378;D006801;D008565/Q000187;D026901;D027425;D010718/Q000378;D049294;D013050	4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan/analogs & derivatives;4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan/metabolism;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/blood;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/physiology;Alkylating Agents/pharmacology;Biological Transport, Active/drug effects;Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase/metabolism;Carrier Proteins/drug effects;Drug Resistance, Multiple;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Glutathione/metabolism;Humans;Membrane Proteins/drug effects;Membrane Transport Proteins;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins;Phosphatidylserines/metabolism;Phospholipid Transfer Proteins;Spectrometry, Fluorescence	Kamp D;Haest CW	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
599	9586809	Erythrocyte ascorbate recycling: antioxidant effects in blood.	Ascorbic acid is an important antioxidant in human plasma, but requires efficient recycling from its oxidized forms to avoid irreversible loss. Human erythrocytes prevented oxidation of ascorbate in autologous plasma, an effect that required recycling of ascorbate within the cells. Erythrocytes had a high capacity to take up dehydroascorbate, the two-electron oxidized product of ascorbate, and to reduce it to ascorbate. Uptake and conversion of dehydroascorbate to ascorbate was saturable, was half-maximal at 400 microM dehydroascorbate, and achieved a maximal intracellular ascorbate concentration of 1.5 mM. In the presence of 100 microM dehydroascorbate, erythrocytes had the capacity to regenerate a 35 microM ascorbate concentration in blood every 3 min. Ascorbate recycling from DHA required intracellular GSH. Depletion of erythrocyte GSH by more than 50% with diamide did not acutely affect the cellular ascorbate content, but did impair the subsequent ability of GSH-depleted cells to recycle dehydroascorbate to ascorbate. Whereas erythrocyte ascorbate recycling was coupled to GSH, an overwhelming extracellular oxidant stress depleted both ascorbate and alpha-tocopherol before the GSH content of cells fell appreciably. Recycled ascorbate was released from cells into plasma, but at a rate less than one tenth that of dehydroascorbate uptake and conversion to ascorbate. Nonetheless, ascorbate released from cells protected endogenous alpha-tocopherol in human LDL from oxidation by a water soluble free radical initiator. These results suggests that recycling of ascorbate in erythrocytes helps to maintain the antioxidant reserve of whole blood.	eng	789	797	Free radical biology & medicine	24	5	1998	Mar	15	D000975/Q000378;D001205/Q000097;D001692/Q000502;D004912/Q000378;D005609;D005978/Q000097;D006801;D008077/Q000097;D018384/Q000502;D012016;D014810/Q000097	Antioxidants/metabolism;Ascorbic Acid/blood;Biological Transport/physiology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Free Radicals;Glutathione/blood;Humans;Lipoproteins, LDL/blood;Oxidative Stress/physiology;Reference Values;Vitamin E/blood	Mendiratta S;Qu ZC;May JM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

601	9693963	Purification and characterization of adenosine diphosphate ribose pyrophosphatase from human erythrocytes.	Free ADP-ribose is a turnover product of NAD+, protein-bound polymeric and monomeric ADP-ribose, and cyclic ADP-ribose. But little is known about the specific cellular roles or metabolism of free ADP-ribose. ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.13), which hydrolyzes ADP-ribose into AMP and ribose-5'-phosphate, was purified from human erythrocytes. Purification was achieved to homogeneity by successive chromatographic steps, resulting in a final purification of 75,790-fold from the hemolysate. The purified enzyme showed a single band with the molecular weight of 34 kDa on SDS-PAGE both in the presence and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The molecular weight of the native enzyme calculated by gel filtration was 68 kDa, indicating that the active enzyme is a dimer of identical subunits. The enzyme requiring Mg2+ showed highest activity toward ADP-ribose, and about 40-70% activities with IDP-ribose, ADP-mannose and GDP-mannose. The enzyme showed a Km of 169 +/- 11 microM for ADP-ribose, broad pH optimum around pH 9.5, and pI of 5.1. ADP was a potent noncompetitive inhibitor with a Ki of 16 +/- 1.2 microM. These results suggest that our enzyme is unique, and different from the other ADP-ribose pyrophosphatases reported. ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase may play an important role in the regulation of intracellular steady-state of free ADP-ribose.	eng	629	638	The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology	30	5	1998	May		D000246/Q000378;D000645;D005591;D002847;D002848;D003636;D003911;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008970;D011755/Q000737;D011755/Q000302;D011755/Q000378;D012685/Q000031;D013379	Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Ammonium Sulfate;Chemical Fractionation;Chromatography, Agarose;Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose;DEAE-Cellulose;Dextrans;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;Pyrophosphatases/chemistry;Pyrophosphatases/isolation & purification;Pyrophosphatases/metabolism;Sepharose/analogs & derivatives;Substrate Specificity	Kim JS;Kim WY;Rho HW;Park JW;Park BH;Han MK;Kim UH;Kim HR	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
602	9806760	The transmembrane glycoprotein CD38 is a catalytically active transporter responsible for generation and influx of the second messenger cyclic ADP-ribose across membranes.	CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in many vertebrate cells. It is a bifunctional ectoenzyme that catalyzes both the synthesis of Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) from NAD+ and the degradation of cADPR to ADP-ribose by means of its ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR-hydrolase activities, respectively. The cyclase also converts NGD+ to cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR), which is refractory to cADPR-hydrolase. cADPR, but not cGDPR, is a potent calcium mobilizer from intracellular stores. It has been demonstrated to be a new second messenger involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in many cell types, from plants to mammals. The number of physiological processes shown to be regulated by cADPR is steadily increasing. A topological paradox exists because ectocellularly generated cADPR acts intracellularly. Here we demonstrate that the catalytic functioning of CD38 is accompanied by a cADPR (cGDPR) -transporting activity across natural and artificial membranes. In resealed membranes from CD38(+) human erythrocytes, transport of catalytically generated cADPR or cGDPR was saturation dependent and occurred against a concentration gradient. Likewise, CD38-reconstituted proteoliposomes were active in concentrating NAD+ (NGD+) -derived cADPR (cGDPR) inside the vesicle compartment. Moreover, the cADPR-transporting activity in CD38 proteoliposomes prevented the hydrolase-catalyzed degradation to ADPR that occurs conversely with detergent-solubilized CD38, resulting in selective influx of cADPR. In the CD38 proteoliposomes, catalytically active CD38 exhibited monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric structures. In CD38 sense- but not in antisense-transfected HeLa cells, externally added NAD+ resulted in significant, transient increases in cytosolic calcium. These data suggest that transmembrane juxtaposition of two or four CD38 monomers can generate a catalytically active channel for selective formation and influx of cADPR (cGDPR) to reach cADPR-responsive intracellular calcium stores.	eng	1507	1520	FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology	12	14	1998	Nov		D036541;D051997;D000246/Q000031;D000246/Q000378;D015703;D000943/Q000378;D001692;D002384;D036563;D004910/Q000378;D006156/Q000378;D006367;D006801;D008562/Q000378;D009243/Q000378;D009244/Q000378;D011510/Q000378;D015290	ADP-ribosyl Cyclase;ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/analogs & derivatives;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Antigens, CD;Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism;Biological Transport;Catalysis;Cyclic ADP-Ribose;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Guanosine Diphosphate Sugars/metabolism;HeLa Cells;Humans;Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism;NAD/metabolism;NAD+ Nucleosidase/metabolism;Proteolipids/metabolism;Second Messenger Systems	Franco L;Guida L;Bruzzone S;Zocchi E;Usai C;De Flora A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
603	9765240	Identification of free deaminated sialic acid (2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid) in human red blood cells and its elevated expression in fetal cord red blood cells and ovarian cancer cells.	"Chemical studies have shown the occurrence of the deaminated sialic acid 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN) in paired samples of blood obtained from mothers and newborns of healthy human individuals. Most of the KDN was found in red blood cells, although low levels were detected in mononuclear cells. No N-glycolylneuraminic acid was detected. Unexpectedly, nearly all of the KDN in fetal cord and matched maternal red blood cells was present as the free sugar and comparatively little occurred conjugated or as cytidine 5'-KDN phosphate. The amount of free KDN in fetal newborn red blood cells was 2.4-fold higher than in red blood cells from the mothers or from healthy nonpregnant women. Free KDN was also identified in normal human ovaries, in ovarian tumors, and in ascites cells obtained from ovarian cancer patients. Importantly, as in fetal cord red blood cells, a distinguishing feature of KDN expression in ovarian tumor cells was an elevated level of free KDN compared with normal controls. A positive correlation was found between an increase in the ratio of free KDN/N-acetylneuraminic acid in ovarian adenocarcinomas and the stage of malignancy. This was particularly evident in tumor cells isolated from the ascites fluid. The central importance of these new findings is 2-fold. First, they show that free KDN is a minor but ubiquitous sialic acid in human red blood cells and that its elevated expression in red blood cells from fetal cord blood compared with maternal red blood cells may be developmentally related to blood cell formation during embryogenesis. Second, the enhanced expression of KDN in ovarian cancer cells suggests that this sialic acid, like the alpha2,8-linked polysialic acid glycotope, may be an oncofetal antigen in these tumors and thus could be an ""early warning"" signal for onset of disease and/or a marker for detection of recurrence of disease. These new findings highlight the importance of elucidating the role that KDN and KDN-containing glycoconjugates may play in normal development and malignancy."	eng	27199	27204	The Journal of biological chemistry	273	42	1998	Oct	16	D000230/Q000737;D003641;D004912/Q000737;D005260;D005312/Q000737;D005312/Q000166;D006801;D007231;D019158/Q000302;D010051/Q000737;D010053/Q000737;D011247;D013400/Q000302;D013724/Q000737	Adenocarcinoma/chemistry;Deamination;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Female;Fetal Blood/chemistry;Fetal Blood/cytology;Humans;Infant, Newborn;N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/isolation & purification;Ovarian Neoplasms/chemistry;Ovary/chemistry;Pregnancy;Sugar Acids/isolation & purification;Teratoma/chemistry	Inoue S;Lin SL;Chang T;Wu SH;Yao CW;Chu TY;Troy FA;Inoue Y	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
604	10028241	Membrane permeability of formate in human erythrocytes: NMR measurements.	The rate of the rapid exchange of formate mediated by band 3 in human erythrocytes, under equilibrium exchange conditions, was measured by using a T1 relaxation method with 13C-labelled formate and 13C NMR, and a pulsed field-gradient spin-echo (PFGSE) method using 1H NMR. The former analysis was based on large differences in T1 between the inside and the outside of the cells brought about by added Mn2+; the latter was based on large differences in the apparent diffusion coefficient inside and outside the cells. There was close agreement in the estimates of the membrane permeabilities made using both methods, suggesting a lack of interference of the exchange process by Mn2+. Regression analysis yielded estimates (under the specified conditions, including 37 degrees C) of Vmax of 3.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(-9) and 3.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(-9) mol cm-2 s-1, and K(m) of 9.8 +/- 0.2 and 8.1 +/- 0.2 mM, for the T1 and the PFGSE methods, respectively. These are new estimates made using methodology that has not previously been applied to measuring rapid (sub-second time scale) formate exchange in cells.	eng	158	165	European biophysics journal : EBJ	28	2	1999			D001639/Q000493;D002463;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005561/Q000493;D006801;D019906/Q000379	Bicarbonates/pharmacokinetics;Cell Membrane Permeability;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Formates/pharmacokinetics;Humans;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular/methods	Himmelreich U;Chapman BE;Kuchel PW	Journal, Articles							red cell;erythrocyte	True
605	10192390	Transferrin receptor is necessary for development of erythrocytes and the nervous system.	Plasma iron circulates bound to transferrin (Trf), which solubilizes the ferric ion and attenuates its reactivity. Diferric Trf interacts with cell-surface Trf receptor (Trfr) to undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis into specialized endosomes. Endosomal acidification leads to iron release, and iron is transported out of the endosome through the activity of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1, formerly Nramp2), a transmembrane iron transporter that functions only at low pH. Trf and Trfr then return to the cell surface for reuse, completing a highly efficient cycle. Although the Trf cycle is assumed to be the general mechanism for cellular iron uptake, this has not been validated experimentally. Mice with hypotransferrinaemia (hpx) have little or no plasma Trf. They have severe anaemia, indicating that the Trf cycle is essential for iron uptake by erythroid cells. Other hpx tissues, however, are generally normal, and there is a paradoxical increase in intestinal iron absorption and iron storage. To test the hypothesis that the Trf cycle has unique importance for erythropoiesis, we disrupted the Trfr gene in mice. This results in elimination of the Trf cycle, but leaves other Trf functions intact. Mice lacking Trfr have a more severe phenotype than hpx mice, affecting both erythropoiesis and neurologic development. Furthermore, haploinsufficiency for Trfr results in impaired erythroid development and abnormal iron homeostasis.	eng	396	399	Nature genetics	21	4	1999	Apr		D000740/Q000235;D000740/Q000473;D000818;D004622/Q000737;D004622/Q000473;D004912/Q000502;D004920/Q000235;D006706;D006720;D007408;D007501/Q000097;D007501/Q000378;D051379;D008815;D008817;D009420/Q000196;D011990/Q000235;D012156/Q000378;D014168/Q000172;D014168/Q000235	Anemia/genetics;Anemia/pathology;Animals;Embryo, Mammalian/chemistry;Embryo, Mammalian/pathology;Erythrocytes/physiology;Erythropoiesis/genetics;Homeostasis;Homozygote;Intestinal Absorption;Iron/blood;Iron/metabolism;Mice;Mice, Inbred Strains;Mice, Mutant Strains;Nervous System/embryology;Receptors, Transferrin/genetics;Reticulocytes/metabolism;Transferrin/deficiency;Transferrin/genetics	Levy JE;Jin O;Fujiwara Y;Kuo F;Andrews NC	Journal, Articles							Erythro	True
606	10395453	Structural investigations on human erythrocyte acylpeptide hydrolase by mass spectrometric procedures.	The complete primary structure of human erythrocyte acylpeptide hydrolase has been determined by using a combination of different mass spectrometric procedures and sequencing techniques. These data allowed us to correct the incomplete nucleotide sequence of the DNF15S2 locus on the short arm of human chromosome 3 at region 21, coding for the enzyme. The protein consists of 732 amino acid residues and is acetylated at the N-terminus. Alkylation experiments on the native enzyme demonstrated that all 17 cysteine residues present in the polypeptide chain are in reduced form. Multiple sequence alignment did not reveal striking similarity with proteases of known tertiary structure with the exception of members of the serine oligopeptidase family. Limited proteolysis experiments generated a C-terminal portion, containing all the catalytic triad elements responsible for proteolytic activity, and an N-terminal domain of unknown function, both still strongly associated in a completely active nicked form. The site of tryptic hydrolysis was identified as Arg193. The secondary structural organization of the protease domain of the enzyme is consistent with the alpha/beta hydrolase fold.	eng	349	360	Journal of protein chemistry	18	3	1999	Apr		D000478;D000595;D000818;D003545/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D013058/Q000379;D008969;D010084;D010447/Q000032;D011499;D051381;D017386;D013552;D013997;D014357/Q000378	Alkylation;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Cysteine/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Mass Spectrometry/methods;Molecular Sequence Data;Oxidation-Reduction;Peptide Hydrolases/analysis;Protein Processing, Post-Translational;Rats;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Swine;Time Factors;Trypsin/metabolism	Scaloni A;Ingallinella P;Andolfo A;Jones W;Marino G;Manning JM	Journal, Articles							RBC;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
607	10491986	3-Deoxyglucosone: metabolism, analysis, biological activity, and clinical implication.	3-Deoxyglucosone (3-DG) is synthesized via the Maillard reaction and the polyol pathway, and is detoxified to 3-deoxyfructose and 2-keto-3-deoxygluconic acid. 3-DG rapidly reacts with protein amino groups to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs) such as imidazolone, pyrraline, N'-(carboxymethyl)lysine and pentosidine, among which imidazolone is the AGE most specific for 3-DG. As demonstrated by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or high-performance liquid chromatography, plasma 3-DG levels are markedly increased in diabetes and uremia. Although the plasma 3-DG levels had been controversial, it was clearly demonstrated that its plasma level depends on the deproteinization method by which either free or total 3-DG, presumably bound to proteins, is measured. In diabetes, hyperglycemia enhances the synthesis of 3-DG via the Maillard reaction and the polyol pathway, and thereby leads to its high plasma and erythrocyte levels. In uremia, however, the decreased catabolism of 3-DG, which may be due to the loss of 3-DG reductase activity in the end-stage kidneys, may lead to high plasma 3-DG level. The elevated 3-DG levels in plasma and erythrocytes may promote the formation of AGEs such as imidazolone, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and immunochemistry using an anti-imidazolone antibody. Although AGE-modified proteins prepared in vitro exhibit a variety of biological activities, known AGE structures have not yet been demonstrated to show any biological activities. Because 3-DG is potent in the formation of AGEs and has some biological activities, such as cellular toxicity, it may be more important in the development of diabetic and uremic complications than the known AGE structures. By demonstrating that treatment with an aldose reductase inhibitor reduces the erythrocyte levels of 3-DG and AGEs, such as imidazolone, light is shed on the mystery of how aldose reductase inhibitors may prove beneficial in diabetic complications. These evidences suggest that 3-DG plays a principal role in the development of diabetic and uremic complications.	eng	23	36	Journal of chromatography.

608	10578065	Studies on functions of the 63-kDa A- and 74-kDa B'(delta)-regulatory subunits in human erythrocyte protein phosphatase 2A: dissociation and reassociation of the subunits.	A heterodimeric form, CA, of protein-serine/threonine phosphatase (PP) 2A purified from human erythrocytes was dissociated into a 34-kDa catalytic subunit C and 63-kDa inactive subunit A by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration in the presence of 6 M urea. Reassociation of the C- and A-subunits in the absence of urea suppressed the PP activity of the C subunit toward phosphorylase a, P-H2B histone, and P-H1 histone in the presence or absence of 20 mM MnCl(2) or 50 mM Mg(CH(3)COO)(2), but stimulated the PP activity toward P-H1 histone in the presence of 200 mM NaCl and the Mn(2+)-dependent protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activity toward P-Tyr-Glu copolymers. The 74-kDa inactive B'(delta) subunit was isolated from a heterotrimeric form, CAB'(delta), of PP2A partially purified from human erythrocytes, by heparin-Sepharose column chromatography. The B'(delta) subunit reassociated with CA and suppressed the PP- and PTP-activities of CA. The B'(delta) subunit did not associate with the isolated C subunit directly, and had no effect on the activities of the C subunit, indicating that the A subunit is essential for the association of the B'(delta) subunit with CA and the resulting suppression of the PP- and PTP-activities.	eng	1127	1135	Journal of biochemistry	126	6	1999	Dec		D002850;D004591;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008345/Q000378;D008970;D010446/Q000502;D010749/Q000737;D011487;D054648	Chromatography, Gel;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Manganese/metabolism;Molecular Weight;Peptide Fragments/physiology;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/chemistry;Protein Conformation;Protein Phosphatase 2	Inoue R;Usui H;Tanabe O;Nishito Y;Shimizu M;Takeda M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
609	10567213	Cloning, expression and characterization of YSA1H, a human adenosine 5'-diphosphosugar pyrophosphatase possessing a MutT motif.	The human homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae YSA1 protein, YSA1H, has been expressed as a thioredoxin fusion protein in Escherichia coli. It is an ADP-sugar pyrophosphatase with similar activities towards ADP-ribose and ADP-mannose. Its activities with ADP-glucose and diadenosine diphosphate were 56% and 20% of that with ADP-ribose respectively, whereas its activity towards other nucleoside 5'-diphosphosugars was typically 2-10%. cADP-ribose was not a substrate. The products of ADP-ribose hydrolysis were AMP and ribose 5-phosphate. K(m) and k(cat) values with ADP-ribose were 60 microM and 5.5 s(-1) respectively. The optimal activity was at alkaline pH (7.4-9.0) with 2.5-5 mM Mg(2+) or 100-250 microM Mn(2+) ions; fluoride was inhibitory, with an IC(50) of 20 microM. The YSA1H gene, which maps to 10p13-p14, is widely expressed in all human tissues examined, giving a 1.4 kb transcript. The 41.6 kDa fusion protein behaved as an 85 kDa dimer on gel filtration. After cleavage with enterokinase, the 24.4 kDa native protein fragment ran on SDS/PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa. Immunoblot analysis with a polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant YSA1H revealed the presence of a protein of apparent molecular mass 33 kDa in various human cells, including erythrocytes. The sequence of YSA1H contains a MutT sequence signature motif. A major proposed function of the MutT motif proteins is to eliminate toxic nucleotide metabolites from the cell. Hence the function of YSA1H might be to remove free ADP-ribose arising from NAD(+) and protein-bound poly- and mono-(ADP-ribose) turnover to prevent the occurrence of non-enzymic protein glycation.	eng	331	337	The Biochemical journal	344 Pt 2	Pt 2	1999	Dec	01	D000245/Q000378;D000246/Q000378;D000247/Q000378;D000595;D001483;D003001;D015226/Q000378;D006801;D008969;D011755/Q000235;D017386;D013379;D014018;D000096964	Adenosine Diphosphate Glucose/metabolism;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Adenosine Diphosphate Sugars/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Base Sequence;Cloning, Molecular;Dinucleoside Phosphates/metabolism;Humans;Molecular Sequence Data;Pyrophosphatases/genetics;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Substrate Specificity;Tissue Distribution;Nudix Hydrolases	Gasmi L;Cartwright JL;McLennan AG	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
610	10090333	Carbonic anhydrase IV activity is localized on the exterior surface of human erythrocytes.	Carbonic anhydrase (CA) cytoplasmic isozymes CA I and CA II were found in human erythrocyte membrane ghosts, when prepared at pH 5.4 and pH 7.4, but not in ghosts prepared at pH 8.2. These findings could indicate that previously reported CA activity of ghosts was owing to contamination by CA I and CA II during the preparation of the ghosts. However, using a sensitive micro-assay, CA activity was also found in ghosts prepared at pH 8.2. This activity constitutes 0.2% of the erythrocytes' total CA-activity, and originates from a membrane-associated isoform of CA, located at the exterior membrane surface. It has immunochemical and kinetic properties like those of the membrane-bound CA IV, previously isolated from kidney, lung and small blood vessels. Its function is possibly to interact with the red cell membrane anionic transport protein, band 3, for the bicarbonate/chloride exchange.	eng	211	218	Acta physiologica Scandinavica	165	2	1999	Feb		D000042;D000818;D015153;D002245/Q000378;D002257/Q000494;D002256/Q000187;D002256/Q000378;D002417;D002463/Q000187;D004591;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000201;D005016/Q000494;D006801;D005779	Absorption;Animals;Blotting, Western;Carbon Dioxide/metabolism;Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors/pharmacology;Carbonic Anhydrases/drug effects;Carbonic Anhydrases/metabolism;Cattle;Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Ethoxzolamide/pharmacology;Humans;Immunodiffusion	Wistrand PJ;Carter ND;Conroy CW;Mahieu I	Journal, Articles							Erythro	True

612	10064135	Cytidine triphosphate synthase activity and mRNA expression in normal human blood cells.	Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthase is one of the key enzymes in pyrimidine nucleotide anabolic pathways. The activity of this enzyme is elevated in various malignancies including acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). In this study we investigated the activity of CTP synthase in various human blood cells isolated from healthy volunteers by density centrifugation and elutriation centrifugation. We also investigated the mRNA expression of CTP synthase in lymphocytes and monocytes. The highest activity of CTP synthase was found in thrombocytes (6.48 nmol CTP x mg(-1) x h(-1)), followed by that of monocytes (2.23), lymphocytes (1.69), granulocytes (0.52) and erythrocytes (0.42). The activity of CTP synthase in whole blood samples was at an intermediate level (1.27). The mRNA expression of CTP synthase in monocytes was comparable to that observed in lymphocytes.	eng	41	46	Biological chemistry	380	1	1999	Jan		D001792/Q000201;D015152;D019731/Q000096;D019731/Q000097;D004789;D004912/Q000201;D006098/Q000201;D006801;D008214/Q000201;D009000/Q000201;D012333/Q000096;D012333/Q000097	Blood Platelets/enzymology;Blotting, Northern;Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases/biosynthesis;Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases/blood;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Granulocytes/enzymology;Humans;Lymphocytes/enzymology;Monocytes/enzymology;RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis;RNA, Messenger/blood	Verschuur AC;Van Gennip AH;Muller EJ;Voûte PA;Vreken P;Van Kuilenburg AB	Journal, Articles							ERYTHRO;erythrocyte	True
613	10391223	Mutations in a new gene encoding a thiamine transporter cause thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia syndrome.	Thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia syndrome (TRMA; MIM 249270) is an autosomal recessive disorder with features that include megaloblastic anaemia, mild thrombocytopenia and leucopenia, sensorineural deafness and diabetes mellitus. Treatment with pharmacologic doses of thiamine ameliorates the megaloblastic anaemia and diabetes mellitus. A defect in the plasma membrane transport of thiamine has been demonstrated in erythrocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from TRMA patients. The gene causing TRMA was assigned to 1q23.2-q23.3 by linkage analysis. Here we report the cloning of a new gene, SLC19A2, identified from high-through-put genomic sequences due to homology with SLC19A1, encoding reduced folate carrier 1 (refs 8-10). We cloned the entire coding region by screening a human fetal brain cDNA library. SLC19A2 encodes a protein (of 497 aa) predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains. We identified 2 frameshift mutations in exon 2. a 1-bp insertion and a 2-bp deletion, among four Iranian families with TRMA. The sequence homology and predicted structure of SLC19A2, as well as its role in TRMA, suggest that its gene product is a thiamine carrier, the first to be identified in complex eukaryotes.	eng	309	312	Nature genetics	22	3	1999	Jul		D000595;D000749/Q000150;D000749/Q000188;D000749/Q000235;D001483;D002352/Q000235;D003001;D018076/Q000235;D003638/Q000150;D003638/Q000235;D048909;D003920/Q000235;D005260;D006801;D008297;D026901;D008969;D009154;D010375;D017386;D013577;D013831/Q000378;D013831/Q000627	Amino Acid Sequence;Anemia, Megaloblastic/complications;Anemia, Megaloblastic/drug therapy;Anemia, Megaloblastic/genetics;Base Sequence;Carrier Proteins/genetics;Cloning, Molecular;DNA, Complementary/genetics;Deafness/complications;Deafness/genetics;Diabetes Complications;Diabetes Mellitus/genetics;Female;Humans;Male;Membrane Transport Proteins;Molecular Sequence Data;Mutation;Pedigree;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Syndrome;Thiamine/metabolism;Thiamine/therapeutic use	Diaz GA;Banikazemi M;Oishi K;Desnick RJ;Gelb BD	Journal, Articles							Red Blood Cell	True
614	10410961	Determination of differential activities of soluble and membrane-bound catechol-O-methyltransferase in tissues and erythrocytes.	Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) exists as two isoenzymes, a membrane-bound form (MB-COMT) and a soluble form (S-COMT), with different roles in the metabolism of catecholamines and other catechol compounds. This report documents an HPLC assay for separate estimation of S-COMT and MB-COMT activity and examines activities of the two isoenzymes among different rat tissues and in human and rat erythrocytes. Activities of MB-COMT and S-COMT varied widely among tissues. There were higher activities of S-COMT than MB-COMT in all tissues except the adrenal medulla where MB-COMT was the predominant isoenzyme, consistent with the importance of this tissue and MB-COMT for the O-methylation of catecholamines. MB-COMT and S-COMT in rat and human erythrocytes showed divergent levels and patterns of activity. The assay represents a rapid and accurate method for quantifying MB-COMT and S-COMT in various tissues and examining the relative roles of COMT isoenzymes in the metabolism of catechol compounds in health and disease.	eng	347	353	Journal of chromatography.

616	10224133	Cloning and characterization of a mammalian lithium-sensitive bisphosphate 3'-nucleotidase inhibited by inositol 1,4-bisphosphate.	"Discovery of a structurally conserved metal-dependent lithium-inhibited phosphomonoesterase protein family has identified several potential cellular targets of lithium as used to treat manic depression. Here we describe identification of a novel family member using a ""computer cloning"" strategy. Human and murine cDNA clones encoded proteins sharing 92% identity and were highly expressed in kidney. Native and recombinant protein harbored intrinsic magnesium-dependent bisphosphate nucleotidase activity (BPntase), which removed the 3'-phosphate from 3'-5' bisphosphate nucleosides and 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate with Km and Vmax values of 0.5 microM and 40 micromol/min/mg. Lithium uncompetitively inhibited activity with a Ki of 157 microM. Interestingly, BPntase was competitively inhibited by inositol 1,4-bisphosphate with a Ki of 15 microM. Expression of mammalian BPntase complemented defects in hal2/met22 mutant yeast. These data suggest that BPntase's physiologic role in nucleotide metabolism may be regulated by inositol signaling pathways. The presence of high levels of BPntase in the kidney are provocative in light of the roles of bisphosphorylated nucleotides in regulating salt tolerance, sulfur assimilation, detoxification, and lithium toxicity. We propose that inhibition of human BPntase may account for lithium-induced nephrotoxicity, which may be overcome by supplementation of current therapeutic regimes with inhibitors of nucleotide biosynthesis, such as methionine."	eng	13619	13628	The Journal of biological chemistry	274	19	1999	May	07	D000595;D000818;D001483;D003001;D018076;D004791/Q000494;D005816;D006801;D007295/Q000494;D007700;D008094/Q000378;D051379;D008969;D009708/Q000037;D009708/Q000235;D009708/Q000378;D012441/Q000235;D017386	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Base Sequence;Cloning, Molecular;DNA, Complementary;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Genetic Complementation Test;Humans;Inositol Phosphates/pharmacology;Kinetics;Lithium/metabolism;Mice;Molecular Sequence Data;Nucleotidases/antagonists & inhibitors;Nucleotidases/genetics;Nucleotidases/metabolism;Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid	Spiegelberg BD;Xiong JP;Smith JJ;Gu RF;York JD	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
617	10564085	Serine/threonine protein phosphatases and regulation of K-Cl cotransport in human erythrocytes.	Activation of K-Cl cotransport is associated with activation of membrane-bound serine/threonine protein phosphatases (S/T-PPases). We characterize red blood cell S/T-PPases and K-Cl cotransport activity regarding protein phosphatase inhibitors and response to changes in ionic strength and cell size. Protein phosphatase type 1 (PP1) activity is highly sensitive to calyculin A (CalA) but not to okadaic acid (OA). PP2A activity is highly sensitive to CalA and OA. CalA completely inhibits K-Cl cotransport activity, whereas OA partially inhibits K-Cl cotransport. Membrane PP1 and membrane PP2A activities are elevated in cells suspended in hypotonic solutions, where K-Cl cotransport is elevated. Increases in membrane PP1 activity (62 +/- 10% per 100 meq/l) result from decreases in intracellular ionic strength and correlate with increases in K-Cl cotransport activity (54 +/- 10% per 100 meq/l). Increases in membrane PP2A activity (270 +/- 77% per 100 mosM) result from volume increases and also correlate with increases in K-Cl cotransport activity (420 +/- 47% per 100 mosM). The characteristics of membrane-associated PP1 and PP2A are consistent with a role for both phosphatases in K-Cl cotransport activation in human erythrocytes.	eng	C926	C936	The American journal of physiology	277	5	1999	Nov		D000755/Q000378;D001692/Q000502;D002352/Q000378;D048429/Q000502;D003600/Q000378;D003681/Q000378;D004791/Q000494;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007476/Q000494;D008387;D008565/Q000378;D009761/Q000494;D019319/Q000494;D009994;D010080/Q000494;D010749/Q000037;D010749/Q000378;D012694/Q000378;D027981;D013912/Q000378;D014882/Q000502;D000096922	Anemia, Sickle Cell/metabolism;Biological Transport/physiology;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cell Size/physiology;Cytosol/metabolism;Dehydration/metabolism;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Ionophores/pharmacology;Marine Toxins;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Nystatin/pharmacology;Okadaic Acid/pharmacology;Osmolar Concentration;Oxazoles/pharmacology;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism;Serine/metabolism;Symporters;Threonine/metabolism;Water-Electrolyte Balance/physiology;K Cl- Cotransporters	Bize I;Güvenç B;Robb A;Buchbinder G;Brugnara C	Journal, Articles					10.1152/ajpcell.1999.277.5.C926		Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
618	10575355	myo-[3H]-inositol loaded erythrocytes and white ghosts: two models to investigate the phosphatidylinositol synthesis in human red cells.	Human erythrocytes were loaded with myo-[(3)H]-inositol in the presence or absence of cytidine trisphosphate to investigate the synthesis of membrane phosphoinositides in the intact red cell. The addition of cytidylic nucleotides to the loading mixture yielded a four-fold increase in the [(3)H]-labeling of the membranes. The [(3)H]-labeling of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was distinguished by two chromatographic techniques. Experiments performed on white ghosts demonstrated the presence of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase and phosphatidylinositol synthase. These results and those already reported allow to discuss a possible turnover of the inositol polar head.	eng	1011	1014	Biochimie	81	11	1999	Nov		D000328;D051607;D003570/Q000097;D002798/Q000097;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D007294/Q000097;D008565;D008954;D010716/Q000097;D017855/Q000097	Adult;CDP-Diacylglycerol-Inositol 3-Phosphatidyltransferase;Cytidine Triphosphate/blood;Diacylglycerol Cholinephosphotransferase/blood;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Inositol/blood;Membrane Proteins;Models, Biological;Phosphatidylinositols/blood;Transferases (Other Substituted Phosphate Groups)/blood	Piatti E;Piacentini MP;Fraternale D;Bucchini A;Mangani F;Accorsi A	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
619	10548543	Identification and molecular characterization of acyl-CoA synthetase in human erythrocytes and erythroid precursors.	Full-length cDNA species encoding two forms of acyl-CoA synthetase from a K-562 human erythroleukaemic cell line were cloned, sequenced and expressed. The first form, named long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 5 (LACS5), was found to be a novel, unreported, human acyl-CoA synthetase with high similarity to rat brain ACS2 (91% identical). The second form (66% identical with LACS5) was 97% identical with human liver LACS1. The LACS5 gene encodes a highly expressed 2.9 kb mRNA transcript in human haemopoietic stem cells from cord blood, bone marrow, reticulocytes and fetal blood cells derived from fetal liver. An additional 6.3 kb transcript is also found in these erythrocyte precursors; 2.9 and 9.6 kb transcripts of LACS5 are found in human brain, but transcripts are virtually absent from human heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, spleen and skeletal muscle. The 78 kDa expressed LACS5 protein used the long-chain fatty acids palmitic acid, oleic acid and arachidonic acid as substrates. Antibodies directed against LACS5 cross-reacted with erythrocyte membranes. We conclude that early erythrocyte precursors express at least two different forms of acyl-CoA synthetase and that LACS5 is present in mature erythrocyte plasma membranes.	eng	135	143	The Biochemical journal	344 Pt 1	Pt 1	1999	Nov	15	D000328;D000595;D000818;D001483;D003066/Q000097;D003066/Q000737;D003066/Q000235;D017931/Q000235;D018076/Q000235;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D005312/Q000166;D005312/Q000201;D006412/Q000201;D006801;D066298;D007231;D020014;D008969;D008970;D012333/Q000097;D012333/Q000235;D012333/Q000378;D051381;D017386;D014018	Adult;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Base Sequence;Coenzyme A Ligases/blood;Coenzyme A Ligases/chemistry;Coenzyme A Ligases/genetics;DNA Primers/genetics;DNA, Complementary/genetics;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Fetal Blood/cytology;Fetal Blood/enzymology;Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Infant, Newborn;K562 Cells;Molecular Sequence Data;Molecular Weight;RNA, Messenger/blood;RNA, Messenger/genetics;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Rats;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Tissue Distribution	Malhotra KT;Malhotra K;Lubin BH;Kuypers FA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
620	10491340	Uptake and antioxidant effects of ergothioneine in human erythrocytes.	Ergothioneine is a fungal metabolite that may have antioxidant functions in mammalian cells. Although it accumulates to low millimolar concentrations in liver and other tissues, it is not thought to be taken up by mature erythrocytes. During a study of the function of ergothioneine as an antioxidant in human erythrocytes, we found that these cells do take up ergothioneine from the surrounding medium. Ergothioneine concentrations in freshly prepared erythrocytes were 2-9-fold higher than in plasma from the same donor. Slow but progressive accumulation of ergothioneine to about 125% of basal levels was observed in erythrocytes over a 4 h incubation. After a 2 h incubation, intracellular ergothioneine concentrations rose on addition of increasing amounts of ergothioneine to the incubation medium, although saturation was not evident in cells from all donors. Both initial levels and rates of ergothioneine uptake varied in erythrocytes from different donors. Intracellular ergothioneine was stable to depletion of GSH by N-ethylmaleimide and to a more severe oxidant stress induced by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of catalase. These results show that human erythrocytes do take up ergothioneine; however, the GSH results do not support an antioxidant role for ergothioneine in erythrocytes.	eng	407	411	Clinical science (London, England : 1979)	97	4	1999	Oct		D000328;D000975/Q000378;D018929;D004305;D004880/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D005978/Q000097;D006801;D006861/Q000494;D016877/Q000494;D018384/Q000502	Adult;Antioxidants/metabolism;Cell Culture Techniques;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Ergothioneine/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glutathione/blood;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology;Oxidants/pharmacology;Oxidative Stress/physiology	Mitsuyama H;May JM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
621	10523376	Identification of diadenosine hexaphosphate in human erythrocytes.	Diadenosine polyphosphates have been identified as important regulators of vascular tone and blood pressure. In reference to the background of the well-known vasoconstriction induced by hemolysate, we questioned whether this action may be due in part to the presence of diadenosine polyphosphates in human erythrocytes. Therefore, erythrocytes were separated from other blood cells and deproteinated. To concentrate and purify nucleotides, the extract was chromatographed by anion exchange, affinity, and reversed-phase columns. In one of the purified fractions, diadenosine hexaphosphate (diadenosine 5', 5'-P(1), P(6) hexaphosphate [AP(6)A]) was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and enzymatic analysis. Hemolysate of erythrocytes injected into the isolated perfused rat kidney induced a dose-dependent vasoconstriction, which was partially inhibited by P(2)-purinoceptor antagonist. The data document the existence of AP(6)A in erythrocytes. AP(6)A may be involved in the pathogenesis of vasospasm induced by free hemoglobin.	eng	872	875	Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)	34	4 Pt 2	1999	Oct		D000818;D015226/Q000032;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D051381;D014662/Q000032	Animals;Dinucleoside Phosphates/analysis;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Rats;Vasoconstrictor Agents/analysis	Luo J;Jankowski J;Tepel M;von Der Giet M;Zidek W;Schlüter H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
622	10515881	An inositolphosphate-binding immunophilin, IPBP12.	A novel inositolphosphate-binding protein has been identified and shown to be an immunophilin. This protein, which was isolated from human erythrocyte membranes and from K562 (human erythroleukemia) cell membranes, has robust peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity that is strongly inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of FK506 or rapamycin, indicating a member of the FKBP (FK506-binding protein) class. However, unlike the cytosolic FKBP12, the isomerase activity of this membrane-associated immunophilin is strongly inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP(4)), and phosphatidylinositol 4- and 4,5-phosphates, which are suggested to be physiological ligands. The demonstration of a single 12-kD protein that binds both IP(4) or IP(3) and anti-FKBP12 provides strong support for the inositolphosphate-binding immunophilin having an apparent mass of 12 kD, and it is suggested that the protein might be called IPBP12 for 12-kD inositol phosphate binding protein. When an internal tryptic peptide derived from IPBP12 was sequenced, a sequence also present in human cytokeratin 10 was identified, suggesting a cytoskeletal localization for the immunophilin. While purifying IPBP12, it was found that it is immunoprecipitated with specific proteins that include a protein kinase and a phosphoprotein phosphatase. The latter is indicated to be phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (PP-2A). It is suggested that immunophilins promote the assembly of multiprotein complexes that often include a protein kinase or a phosphoprotein phosphatase or both.	eng	2778	2789	Blood	94	8	1999	Oct	15	D000595;D015672/Q000737;D006801;D020104/Q000037;D020104/Q000302;D020104/Q000378;D007295/Q000378;D007295/Q000494;D020014/Q000737;D046911;D008969;D009363/Q000302;D009363/Q000378;D019696/Q000037;D019696/Q000302;D019696/Q000378;D010749/Q000378;D011494/Q000378;D054648;D015290;D016559/Q000494;D022021	Amino Acid Sequence;Erythroid Precursor Cells/chemistry;Humans;Immunophilins/antagonists & inhibitors;Immunophilins/isolation & purification;Immunophilins/metabolism;Inositol Phosphates/metabolism;Inositol Phosphates/pharmacology;K562 Cells/chemistry;Macromolecular Substances;Molecular Sequence Data;Neoplasm Proteins/isolation & purification;Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism;Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/antagonists & inhibitors;Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/isolation & purification;Peptidylprolyl Isomerase/metabolism;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism;Protein Kinases/metabolism;Protein Phosphatase 2;Second Messenger Systems;Tacrolimus/pharmacology;Tacrolimus Binding Proteins	Cunningham EB	Journal, Articles							Erythro;erythrocyte;erythro	True

We determined the plasma, erythrocyte, and urinary concentration of guanidino compounds in 30 hemodialysis patients and 15 patients with chronic renal failure who had not undergone hemodialysis. Guanidino compounds were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma levels of taurocyamine, guanidinosuccinic acid, alpha-N-acetyl-L-arginine, creatine, guanidinobutyric acid, guanidine, and methylguanidine were significantly increased in patients with chronic renal failure with or without hemodialysis. In contrast, plasma guanidinoacetic acid concentrations were significantly decreased. Erythrocyte concentrations of creatinine, guanidinosuccinic acid, guanidine and methylguanidine were also markedly elevated. No correlation was observed between plasma creatinine concentration and erythrocyte concentration of guanidinosuccinic acid or methylguanidine. However, there was a significant correlation between plasma and erythrocyte methylguanidine, and between plasma and erythrocyte guanidinosuccinic acid.	eng	499	514	Renal failure	21	5	1999	Sep		D000328;D000704;D002851/Q000379;D002851/Q000706;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D005470/Q000379;D005470/Q000706;D006146/Q000032;D006146/Q000378;D006801;D007676/Q000378;D007676/Q000628;D008297;D008875;D006435	Adult;Analysis of Variance;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/statistics & numerical data;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Fluorometry/methods;Fluorometry/statistics & numerical data;Guanidines/analysis;Guanidines/metabolism;Humans;Kidney Failure, Chronic/metabolism;Kidney Failure, Chronic/therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Renal Dialysis	Tanaka A;Takahashi Y;Mizokuchi M;Shimada N;Koide H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
624	10524211	Isolation, molecular characterization, and tissue-specific expression of ECP-51 and ECP-54 (TIP49), two homologous, interacting erythroid cytosolic proteins.	We isolated two proteins, ECP-51 and ECP-54, from human erythrocyte cytosol by affinity chromatography using a peptide of the integral membrane protein stomatin as bait. Partial amino acid sequence information obtained by microsequencing allowed us to clone the respective cDNAs. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences revealed that ECP-51 and ECP-54 are homologous (44.2% amino acid identity) and contain ATP-binding sites. ECP-54 was identified as TIP49/RUVBL1/NMP238, which is a component of a large nuclear protein complex, possibly the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme; ECP-51 is a novel protein. Using the two-hybrid system, we showed that these proteins interact with each other. The interaction of ECP-51 and ECP-54 with the stomatin peptide and the localization to the nucleus and cytoplasm suggest an additional function for these proteins as chaperone components.	eng	365	370	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1446	3	1999	Sep	03	D000074183;D000595;D001798/Q000378;D002352/Q000737;D002352/Q000235;D002352/Q000302;D002846;D003001;D003600/Q000378;D004265;D017931;D019992;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D008565;D008969;D016133;D016415;D017386	ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities;Amino Acid Sequence;Blood Proteins/metabolism;Carrier Proteins/chemistry;Carrier Proteins/genetics;Carrier Proteins/isolation & purification;Chromatography, Affinity;Cloning, Molecular;Cytosol/metabolism;DNA Helicases;DNA Primers;Databases as Topic;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Membrane Proteins;Molecular Sequence Data;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid	Salzer U;Kubicek M;Prohaska R	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
625	10477268	Model of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate metabolism in the human erythrocyte based on detailed enzyme kinetic equations: in vivo kinetic characterization of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthase/phosphatase using 13C and 31P NMR.	This is the first in a series of three papers [see also Mulquiney and Kuchel (1999) Biochem. J. 342, 579-594; Mulquiney and Kuchel (1999) Biochem. J. 342, 595-602] that present a detailed mathematical model of erythrocyte metabolism which explains the regulation and control of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) metabolism. 2,3-BPG is a modulator of haemoglobin oxygen affinity and hence plays an important role in blood oxygen transport and delivery. This paper presents an in vivo kinetic characterization of 2,3-BPG synthase/phosphatase (BPGS/P), the enzyme that catalyses both the synthesis and degradation of 2,3-BPG. Much previous work had indicated that the behaviour of this enzyme in vitro is markedly different from that in vivo. (13)C and (31)P NMR were used to monitor the time courses of selected metabolites when erythrocytes were incubated with or without [U-(13)C]glucose. Simulations of the experimental time courses were then made. By iteratively changing the parameters of the BPGS/P part of the model until a good match between the NMR-derived data and simulations were achieved, it was possible to characterize BPGS/P kinetically in vivo. This work revealed that: (1) the pH-dependence of the synthase activity results largely from a strong co-operative inhibition of the synthase activity by protons; (2) 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycerate are much weaker inhibitors of 2,3-BPG phosphatase in vivo than in vitro; (3) the K(m) of BPGS/P for 2,3-BPG is significantly higher than that measured in vitro; (4) the maximal activity of the phosphatase in vivo is approximately twice that in vitro, when P(i) is the sole activator (second substrate); and (5) 2-phosphoglycollate appears to play no role in the activation of the phosphatase in vivo. Using the newly determined kinetic parameters, the percentage of glycolytic carbon flux that passes through the 2, 3-BPG shunt in the normal in vivo steady state was estimated to be 19%.	eng	567	580	The Biochemical journal	342 Pt 3	Pt 3	1999	Sep	15	D019794/Q000378;D001731/Q000378;D002138;D002478;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006019;D006801;D006863;D007700;D009682;D008564;D008956;D010744/Q000737;D010744/Q000378	2,3-Diphosphoglycerate/metabolism;Bisphosphoglycerate Mutase/metabolism;Calibration;Cells, Cultured;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycolysis;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Membrane Potentials;Models, Chemical;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/chemistry;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism	Mulquiney PJ;Bubb WA;Kuchel PW	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
626	10477269	Model of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate metabolism in the human erythrocyte based on detailed enzyme kinetic equations: equations and parameter refinement.	Over the last 25 years, several mathematical models of erythrocyte metabolism have been developed. Although these models have identified the key features in the regulation and control of erythrocyte metabolism, many important aspects remain unexplained. In particular, none of these models have satisfactorily accounted for 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) metabolism. 2,3-BPG is an important modulator of haemoglobin oxygen affinity, and hence an understanding of the regulation of 2,3-BPG concentration is important for understanding blood oxygen transport. A detailed, comprehensive, and hence realistic mathematical model of erythrocyte metabolism is presented that can explain the regulation and control of 2,3-BPG concentration and turnover. The model is restricted to the core metabolic pathways, namely glycolysis, the 2,3-BPG shunt and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and includes membrane transport of metabolites, the binding of metabolites to haemoglobin and Mg(2+), as well as pH effects on key enzymic reactions and binding processes. The model is necessarily complex, since it is intended to describe the regulation and control of 2,3-BPG metabolism under a wide variety of physiological and experimental conditions. In addition, since H(+) and blood oxygen tension are important external effectors of 2,3-BPG concentration, it was important that the model take into account the large array of kinetic and binding phenomena that result from changes in these effectors. Through an iterative loop of experimental and simulation analysis many values of enzyme-kinetic parameters of the model were refined to yield close conformity between model simulations and 'real' experimental data. This iterative process enabled a single set of parameters to be found which described well the metabolic behaviour of the erythrocyte under a wide variety of conditions.	eng	581	596	The Biochemical journal	342 Pt 3	Pt 3	1999	Sep	15	D019794/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D019298/Q000031;D019298/Q000378;D006019;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008274/Q000378;D008956;D009243/Q000378;D009249/Q000378;D010710/Q000378	2,3-Diphosphoglycerate/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose-6-Phosphate/analogs & derivatives;Glucose-6-Phosphate/metabolism;Glycolysis;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Magnesium/metabolism;Models, Chemical;NAD/metabolism;NADP/metabolism;Phosphates/metabolism	Mulquiney PJ;Kuchel PW	Journal, Articles								True
627	10477270	Model of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate metabolism in the human erythrocyte based on detailed enzyme kinetic equations: computer simulation and metabolic control analysis.	This is the third of three papers [see also Mulquiney, Bubb and Kuchel (1999) Biochem. J. 342, 565-578; Mulquiney and Kuchel (1999) Biochem. J. 342, 579-594] for which the general goal was to explain the regulation and control of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) metabolism in human erythrocytes. 2,3-BPG is a major modulator of haemoglobin oxygen affinity and hence is vital in blood oxygen transport. A detailed mathematical model of erythrocyte metabolism was presented in the first two papers. The model was refined through an iterative loop of experiment and simulation and it was used to predict outcomes that are consistent with the metabolic behaviour of the erythrocyte under a wide variety of experimental and physiological conditions. For the present paper, the model was examined using computer simulation and Metabolic Control Analysis. The analysis yielded several new insights into the regulation and control of 2,3-BPG metabolism. Specifically it was found that: (1) the feedback inhibition of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase by 2, 3-BPG are equally as important as the product inhibition of 2,3-BPG synthase in controlling the normal in vivo steady-state concentration of 2,3-BPG; (2) H(+) and oxygen are effective regulators of 2,3-BPG concentration and that increases in 2,3-BPG concentrations are achieved with only small changes in glycolytic rate; (3) these two effectors exert most of their influence through hexokinase and phosphofructokinase; (4) flux through the 2,3-BPG shunt changes in absolute terms in response to different energy demands placed on the cell. This response of the 2,3-BPG shunt contributes an [ATP]-stabilizing effect. A 'cost' of this is that 2, 3-BPG concentrations are very sensitive to the energy demand of the cell and; (5) the flux through the 2,3-BPG shunt does not change in response to different non-glycolytic demands for NADH.	eng	597	604	The Biochemical journal	342 Pt 3	Pt 3	1999	Sep	15	D019794/Q000378;D003198;D004548;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D005246;D006019;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008956;D010101;D010427	2,3-Diphosphoglycerate/metabolism;Computer Simulation;Elasticity;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Feedback;Glycolysis;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Models, Chemical;Oxygen Consumption;Pentose Phosphate Pathway	Mulquiney PJ;Kuchel PW	Journal, Articles							RBC;red blood cell;Red Blood Cell	True
628	10942414	Human erythrocyte pyrimidine 5-nucleotidase, PN-I, is identical to p36, a protein associated to lupus inclusion formation in response to alpha-interferon.	Erythrocyte maturation is accompanied by RNA degradation and release of mononucleotides. We have previously purified PN-I, a pyrimidine nucleotidase whose deficiency is associated with hemolytic anemia. Computer-aided analysis of PN-I tryptic and CNBr peptide sequences revealed substantial identity with tryptic peptide sequences reported for p36, an alpha-interferon-induced protein. PN-I partial sequences were matched through the expressed sequence tag database with different human complementary DNA (cDNA) clones, whose sequences were exploited to screen a human placenta cDNA library. PN-I cDNA, coding for a 286-residue protein, was expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding a fully active recombinant enzyme. The recombinant protein sequence comprised the peptide sequences determined for PN-I and p36. Rabbit antisera raised against two peptides deriving from p36 and PN-I tryptic digestions, respectively, recognized both wild-type and recombinant PN-I. Molecular properties of the two proteins were essentially the same. We conclude that p36 and PN-I are identical proteins.

629	11078710	Nitrite uptake and metabolism and oxidant stress in human erythrocytes.	Nitric oxide, when released into the bloodstream, is quickly scavenged by Hb in erythrocytes or oxidized to nitrite. Nitrite can also enter erythrocytes and oxidize Hb. The goals of this work were to determine the mechanism of erythrocyte nitrite uptake and whether this uptake causes oxidant stress in these cells. Erythrocytes took up 0.8 mM nitrite with a half-time of 11 min. Nitrite uptake was sensitive to temperature and to the pH and ionic composition of the medium but was not inhibited by the specific anion-exchange inhibitor DIDS. About 25% of nitrite uptake occurred on the sodium-dependent phosphate transporter and the rest as diffusion of nitrous acid or other species across the plasma membrane. Methemoglobin formation increased in proportion to the intracellular nitrite concentration. Nitrite reacted with erythrocyte ascorbate, but ascorbate loading of cells decreased nitrite-induced methemoglobin formation only at high nitrite concentrations. In conclusion, nitrite rapidly enters erythrocytes and reacts with oxyhemoglobin but does not exert a strong oxidant stress on these cells.	eng	C1946	C1954	American journal of physiology.

630	10672002	Insulin stimulates NHE1 activity by sequential activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C zeta in human erythrocytes.	The signaling cascade linking insulin receptor stimulation to the activation of Na/H exchanger (NHE) was investigated in human erythrocytes, a simple cell model expressing the NHE1 isoform and protein kinase C (PKC) alpha and zeta isoforms only. Our results demonstrate the presence of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase in these cells and its activation by insulin. With a similar time-course, insulin also promoted both the translocation and activation of PKC zeta, but had no effect on PKC alpha. Inhibition of PtdIns 3-kinase with wortmannin prevented the activation of PKC zeta by insulin. Stimulation of NHE1 was observed after 10 min of insulin treatment and persisted for at least 60 min. This effect was totally abolished by wortmannin or GF 109203X, an inhibitor of all PKC isoforms, but not by Gö 6976, a specific inhibitor of conventional and novel PKCs (e.g. PKC alpha). These data indicate that PKC zeta activation is mediated by a PtdIns 3-kinase-dependent mechanism and that NHE1 stimulation involves the sequential activation of PtdIns 3-kinase and PKC zeta. In addition, insulin stimulation of NHE1 occurred without altering the phosphorylation state of the exchanger, suggesting that the phosphorylation of an ancillary protein by PKC zeta would be responsible for activation of the transporter.	eng	955	962	European journal of biochemistry	267	4	2000	Feb		D000730/Q000494;D001692/Q000187;D002227/Q000494;D004789/Q000187;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007211/Q000494;D007328/Q000494;D007527/Q000037;D007527/Q000378;D008301/Q000494;D019869/Q000378;D000081082;D010766/Q000187;D019000/Q000378;D011233;D011485/Q000187;D011493/Q000037;D011493/Q000378;D051571;D015398/Q000187;D017923/Q000378;D013997;D000077191	Androstadienes/pharmacology;Biological Transport/drug effects;Carbazoles/pharmacology;Enzyme Activation/drug effects;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Indoles/pharmacology;Insulin/pharmacology;Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Maleimides/pharmacology;Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism;Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors;Phosphorylation/drug effects;Phosphotyrosine/metabolism;Precipitin Tests;Protein Binding/drug effects;Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors;Protein Kinase C/metabolism;Protein Kinase C-alpha;Signal Transduction/drug effects;Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/metabolism;Time Factors;Wortmannin	Sauvage M;Mazière P;Fathallah H;Giraud F	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

632	10710494	In vivo rates of erythrocyte glutathione synthesis in children with severe protein-energy malnutrition.	Although the compromised GSH status of children with edematous protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) has been documented, the in vivo kinetic mechanism(s) responsible for this is not known. To determine if decreased synthesis contributes to the alteration of GSH homeostasis, the fractional and absolute rates of synthesis of erythrocyte GSH were determined shortly after admission (study 1), approximately 9 days postadmission (study 2), and at recovery (study 3) in seven children with edematous PEM and seven children with nonedematous PEM. Children with edematous PEM had significantly lower erythrocyte GSH and slower absolute rates of GSH synthesis than children with nonedematous PEM both shortly after admission, when they were both malnourished and infected, and approximately 9 days later, when the infection had resolved but they were still malnourished. At these times, the edematous group also had significantly lower erythrocyte GSH concentrations and absolute rates of synthesis than at recovery. Plasma and erythrocyte-free cysteine concentrations of the edematous group were significantly lower at studies 1 and 2 than at recovery. In contrast, erythrocyte GSH concentrations, rates of GSH synthesis, and plasma and erythrocyte free cysteine concentrations of the nonedematous group were similar at all three time points and greater at studies 1 and 2 than in the edematous group. These results confirm that GSH deficiency is characteristic of edematous PEM and suggest that this is due to a reduced rate of synthesis secondary to a shortage in cysteine.	eng	E405	E412	American journal of physiology.

633	10764208	Cationic amino acid transport through system y+L in erythrocytes of patients with lysinuric protein intolerance.	We test the hypothesis that lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI), a rare autosomal recessive defect of cationic amino acid transport, results from the absence of the recently described y+L amino acid transporter. We compare fluxes of lysine (1 microM) into erythrocytes of normal subjects with those of patients homozygous for the LPI mutation. No significant differences in fluxes through system y+L in normal or LPI cells were found, excluding the possibility that system y+L cannot be expressed in patients with LPI. Reasons for supposing that there may be tissue-specific processing of two recently described genes encoding the y+L transporter are discussed. Polymerase chain reaction measurement of expression of these two genes in an erythroleukemic cell line suggests that alternatively there may be an as-yet-unidentified additional member of this gene family.	eng	513	516	Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology	439	5	2000	Mar		D000293;D000328;D000592/Q000235;D000592/Q000378;D015703/Q000235;D015703/Q000378;D001692/Q000502;D002352/Q000235;D002352/Q000378;D002412/Q000493;D002648;D018076;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000378;D027261;D015870/Q000502;D006801;D020014;D008239/Q000493;D015345;D012333/Q000032	Adolescent;Adult;Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/genetics;Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/metabolism;Antigens, CD/genetics;Antigens, CD/metabolism;Biological Transport/physiology;Carrier Proteins/genetics;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cations/pharmacokinetics;Child;DNA, Complementary;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fusion Regulatory Protein-1;Gene Expression/physiology;Humans;K562 Cells;Lysine/pharmacokinetics;Oligonucleotide Probes;RNA, Messenger/analysis	Boyd CA;Deves R;Laynes R;Kudo Y;Sebastio G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
634	10719179	Identification of oxidized protein hydrolase of human erythrocytes as acylpeptide hydrolase.	Partial amino acid sequence of 80 kDa oxidized protein hydrolase (OPH), a serine protease present in human erythrocyte cytosol (Fujino et al., J. Biochem. 124 (1998) 1077-1085) that is adherent to oxidized erythrocyte membranes and preferentially degrades oxidatively damaged proteins (Beppu et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1196 (1994) 81-87; Fujino et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1374 (1998) 47-55) was determined. The N-terminal amino acid of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP)-labeled OPH was suggested to be masked. Six peptide fragments of OPH obtained by digestion of DFP-labeled OPH with lysyl endopeptidase were isolated by use of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and the sequence of more than eight amino acids from the N-terminal position of each peptide was determined. Results of homology search of amino acid sequence of each peptide strongly suggested that the protein was identical with human liver acylpeptide hydrolase (ACPH). OPH showed ACPH activity when N-acetyl-L-alanine p-nitroanilide and N-acetylmethionyl L-alanine were used as substrates. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged recombinant ACPH (rACPH) was prepared by use of baculovirus expression system as a 107-kDa protein from cDNA of human erythroleukemic cell line K-562. rACPH reacted with anti-OPH antiserum from rabbit. rACPH showed OPH activity when hydrogen peroxide-oxidized or glycated bovine serum albumin was used as substrates. As well as the enzyme activities of OPH, those of rACPH were inhibited by DFP. The results clearly demonstrate that ACPH, whose physiological function has not yet been well characterized, can play an important role as OPH in destroying oxidatively damaged proteins in living cells.	eng	102	112	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1478	1	2000	Mar	16	D000595;D016367/Q000235;D002851;D003001;D004912/Q000201;D015870;D006801;D007531/Q000737;D008969;D010084;D010446/Q000737;D010447/Q000737;D010447/Q000235;D011480/Q000737;D012697;D012710/Q000737	Amino Acid Sequence;Baculoviridae/genetics;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cloning, Molecular;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Gene Expression;Humans;Isoflurophate/chemistry;Molecular Sequence Data;Oxidation-Reduction;Peptide Fragments/chemistry;Peptide Hydrolases/chemistry;Peptide Hydrolases/genetics;Protease Inhibitors/chemistry;Serine Endopeptidases;Serum Albumin, Bovine/chemistry	Fujino T;Watanabe K;Beppu M;Kikugawa K;Yasuda H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
635	10819963	Transmembrane movement of diether phospholipids in human erythrocytes and human fibroblasts.	We have synthesized spin-labeled (SL) and fluorescently labeled diacyl, 1-alkyl-2-acyl-, and di-alkyl glycerophospholipids. The sn-2 chain was a short chain with either a nitroxide group or a 7-nitro-2, 1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl (NBD). After incorporation in the exoplasmic leaflet of human erythrocytes, we found that SL-phosphatidylcholine (PC) redistributed very slowly across the plasma membrane, less than 20% reaching the cytoplasmic leaflet in 3 h at 37 degrees C. In contrast, SL-phosphatidylserine (PS) accumulated on the cytoplasmic leaflet with the same plateau corresponding to 90% of the probes inside. The characteristic times for inward redistribution were different for the three PS analogues: at 37 degrees C, the t(1/2) for the diacyl, alkyl-acyl, and dialkyl compounds were 2.3, 3.5, and 41 min, respectively. ATP depletion or incubation with N-ethylmaleimide inhibited the rapid translocation of the PS derivatives. The diether PS bearing an NBD group translocated very slowly in human erythrocytes and no acceleration by ATP could be measured. On the other hand, in human fibroblasts, the diether NBD-PS and SL-PS were both transported from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic monolayer of the plasma membrane as it is the case for the transport of the respective diester PS analogues. These results prove that the ether bonds do not prevent completely PS binding and translocation by the aminophospholipid translocase despite a probable hindrance due to the ether linkage on the sn-2 chain. Because of the high stability of the ether linkage, SL and NBD diether analogues should be useful to investigate lipid traffic in cultured cells.	eng	4994	5003	Biochemistry	39	17	2000	May	02	D001692;D002462/Q000378;D002462/Q000648;D002478;D004910/Q000378;D004910/Q000648;D005347/Q000378;D005347/Q000648;D005456;D020404/Q000737;D020404/Q000378;D006801;D013113	Biological Transport;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Cell Membrane/ultrastructure;Cells, Cultured;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/ultrastructure;Fibroblasts/metabolism;Fibroblasts/ultrastructure;Fluorescent Dyes;Glycerophospholipids/chemistry;Glycerophospholipids/metabolism;Humans;Spin Labels	Fellmann P;Hervé P;Pomorski T;Müller P;Geldwerth D;Herrmann A;Devaux PF	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
636	11185987	Multi-effective properties of homogentisic acid revealed in reactions with human hemoglobin and human erythrocytic hemoglobin.	Homogentisic acid (HGA) causes oxidation of human oxyhemoglobin and reduction of methemoglobin. The rate of oxidation of oxyhemoglobin by HGA is greatly accelerated in the presence of myo-inositol hexakis-phosphate (P6-inositol) or superoxide dismutase (SOD), but is inhibited in the presence of catalase. The reduction rate of methemoglobin by HGA is accelerated in the presence of P6-inositol but is greatly inhibited in the presence of SOD. It is suggested that the semiquinone and quinone form of HGA and oxygen radicals may be involved in the mechanism of oxido-reductive reactions of human hemoglobin with HGA. In addition, a new anodic hemoglobin found by isoelectric focusing electrophoresis was produced during the reaction of oxyhemoglobin with HGA. When human erythrocytes were exposed to HGA for several hours at 37 degrees C (pH 7.4), the anodic oxyhemoglobin (HGA-modified hemoglobin) and its half met-form hemoglobin [(alpha3+beta2+)2 of HGA-modified hemoglobin] were produced in significant amounts. HGA-modified hemoglobin was stably purified and showed increased oxygen affinity, absence of titratable sulfhydryl groups, and the absorption spectrum of normal oxyhemoglobin. Our results demonstrate that HGA shows multiple effects on human hemoglobin and erythrocytic hemoglobin, which is consistent with the evidence that HGA is involved in various pathological conditions such as arthritis and carcinogenesis in humans.	eng	318	324	International journal of hematology	72	3	2000	Oct		D004912/Q000378;D006454/Q000737;D006454/Q000378;D006713/Q000737;D006713/Q000378;D006801	Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemoglobins/chemistry;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Homogentisic Acid/chemistry;Homogentisic Acid/metabolism;Humans	Yoneda Y;Akazawa M;Koizumi J;Takasaki M;Yamaguchi J;Tomoda A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True

638	10962014	The molecular basis for Na-dependent phosphate transport in human erythrocytes and K562 cells.	The kinetics of sodium-stimulated phosphate flux and phosphate-stimulated sodium flux in human red cells have been previously described (Shoemaker, D.G., C.A. Bender, and R.B. Gunn. 1988. J. Gen. Physiol. 92:449-474). However, despite the identification of multiple isoforms in three gene families (Timmer, R.T., and R.B. Gunn. 1998. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 274:C757-C769), the molecular basis for the sodium-phosphate cotransporter in erythrocytes is unknown. Most cells express multiple isoforms, thus disallowing explication of isoform-specific kinetics and function. We have found that erythrocyte membranes express one dominant isoform, hBNP-1, to which the kinetics can thus be ascribed. In addition, because the erythrocyte Na-PO(4) cotransporter can also mediate Li-PO(4) cotransport, it has been suggested that this transporter functions as the erythrocyte Na-Li exchanger whose activity is systematically altered in patients with bipolar disease and patients with essential hypertension. To determine the molecular basis for the sodium-phosphate cotransporter, we reasoned that if the kinetics of phosphate transport in a nucleated erythroid-like cell paralleled those of the Na-activated pathway in anucleated erythrocytes and yet were distinct from those known for other Na-PO(4) cotransporters, then the expressed genes may be the same in both cell types. In this study, we show that the kinetics of sodium phosphate cotransport were similar in anuclear human erythrocytes and K562 cells, a human erythroleukemic cell line. Although the erythrocyte fluxes were 750-fold smaller, the half-activation concentrations for phosphate and sodium and the relative cation specificities for activation of (32)PO(4) influx were similar. Na-activation curves for both cell types showed cooperativity consistent with the reported stoichiometry of more than one Na cotransported per PO(4). In K562 cells, external lithium activation of phosphate influx was also cooperative. Inhibition by arsenate, K(I) = 2.6-2.7 mM, and relative inhibition by amiloride, amiloride analogs, phosphonoformate, and phloretin were similar. These characteristics were different from those reported for hNaPi-3 and hPiT-1 in other systems. PCR analysis of sodium-phosphate cotransporter isoforms in K562 cells demonstrated the presence of mRNAs for hPiT-1, hPiT-2, and hBNP-1. The mRNAs for hNaPi-10 and hNaPi-3, the other two known isoforms, were absent. Western analysis of erythrocytes and K562 cells with isoform-specific antibodies detected the presence of only hBNP-1, an isoform expressed in brain neurons and glia. The similarities in the kinetics and the expression of only hBNP-1 protein in the two cell types is strong evidence that hBNP-1 is the erythrocyte and K562 cell sodium-phosphate cotransporter.	eng	363	378	The Journal of general physiology	116	3	2000	Sep		D000595;D000818;D001483;D001693;D002352/Q000037;D002352/Q000097;D002352/Q000235;D017931/Q000235;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D020014;D007700;D008969;D010710/Q000097;D010802;D016133;D020033/Q000037;D020033/Q000097;D020033/Q000235;D012964/Q000097;D050608;D027981	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Base Sequence;Biological Transport, Active;Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors;Carrier Proteins/blood;Carrier Proteins/genetics;DNA Primers/genetics;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;K562 Cells;Kinetics;Molecular Sequence Data;Phosphates/blood;Phylogeny;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Protein Isoforms/antagonists & inhibitors;Protein Isoforms/blood;Protein Isoforms/genetics;Sodium/blood;Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins;Symporters	Timmer RT;Gunn RB	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
639	10947968	Multidrug resistance protein 1 regulates lipid asymmetry in erythrocyte membranes.	The role of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) in the maintenance of transbilayer lipid asymmetry in the erythrocyte membrane was investigated. The transbilayer distribution of endogenous phospholipids and [(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl (NBD)-labelled lipid analogues was compared in the absence and the presence of inhibitors of MRP1. At equilibrium the transbilayer distribution of the NBD analogues (in the absence of MRP1 inhibitors) was very similar to that of the endogenous lipids. Inhibition of MRP1 by verapamil or indomethacin resulted in a shift in the amount of probe that was internalized: approx. 50% of NBD-labelled phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and 9% of NBD-sphingomyelin (NBD-Spm) were no longer extractable by BSA in cells treated with inhibitor, in comparison with 25% and 3% for control cells respectively. To verify whether inhibition of MRP1 also affected the distribution of the endogenous phospholipids, phospholipase A2 and sphingomyelinase were used to assess the amount of each of the various lipid classes present in the membrane outer leaflet. No shift in phospholipid distribution was observed after 5 h of incubation with verapamil or indomethacin. However, after 48 h of incubation with these inhibitors, significantly smaller amounts of PtdCho and Spm were present in the outer membrane leaflet. No appreciable change was observed in the distribution of phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylserine. Decreased hydrolysis of PtdCho and Spm was not due to endovesicle formation, as revealed by electron microscopy. This is the first report to show that MRP1 has a role in the maintenance of the outwards orientation of endogenous choline-containing phospholipids in the erythrocyte membrane.	eng	531	535	The Biochemical journal	350 Pt 2	Pt 2	2000	Sep	01	D009327/Q000031;D009327/Q000494;D018528/Q000378;D000614;D015119/Q000494;D000894/Q000494;D002462/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000648;D005456/Q000494;D006801;D006868;D007213/Q000494;D008051/Q000378;D008854;D027425;D010713/Q000378;D010741/Q000378;D054467;D010743/Q000378;D013108/Q000378;D013997;D014665/Q000494;D014700/Q000494	4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan/analogs & derivatives;4-Chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan/pharmacology;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism;Aminocaproates;Aminocaproic Acid/pharmacology;Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/ultrastructure;Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology;Humans;Hydrolysis;Indomethacin/pharmacology;Lipid Bilayers/metabolism;Microscopy, Electron;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins;Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism;Phospholipases A/metabolism;Phospholipases A2;Phospholipids/metabolism;Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism;Time Factors;Vasodilator Agents/pharmacology;Verapamil/pharmacology	Dekkers DW;Comfurius P;van Gool RG;Bevers EM;Zwaal RF	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

Physiol. 275, H1726, 1998). Membrane proteins involved in the release of ATP from erythrocytes now appear to include members of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) family (C. F. Higgins, Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 8, 67, 1992; C. F. Higgins, Cell 82, 693, 1995). In addition to defining physiologically the presence of ABC proteins in RBCs, accumulating gel electrophoretic evidence suggests that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1), respectively, constitute significant proteins in the red blood cell membrane. As such, this finding makes the mature erythrocyte compartment a major mammalian repository of these important ABC proteins. Because of its relative structural simplicity and ready accessibility, the erythrocyte offers an ideal system to explore details of the physiological functions of ABC proteins. Moreover, the presence of different ABC proteins in a single membrane implies that interaction among these proteins and with other membrane proteins may be the norm and not the exception in terms of modulation of their functions.	eng	165	180	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	27	1	2001			D018528/Q000494;D000251/Q000494;D000255/Q000097;D000255/Q000493;D000818;D015703/Q000494;D001081;D001692;D003550/Q000097;D003550/Q000209;D003550/Q000503;D019005/Q000235;D019005/Q000494;D004910/Q000737;D004910/Q000378;D004910/Q000473;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000473;D006801;D051379;D018345;D027425	ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/pharmacology;Adenosine Triphosphatases/pharmacology;Adenosine Triphosphate/blood;Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacokinetics;Animals;Antigens, CD/pharmacology;Apyrase;Biological Transport;Cystic Fibrosis/blood;Cystic Fibrosis/etiology;Cystic Fibrosis/physiopathology;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/genetics;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/chemistry;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/pathology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/pathology;Humans;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins	Abraham EH;Sterling KM;Kim RJ;Salikhova AY;Huffman HB;Crockett MA;Johnston N;Parker HW;Boyle WE;Hartov A;Demidenko E;Efird J;Kahn J;Grubman SA;Jefferson DM;Robson SC;Thakar JH;Lorico A;Rappa G;Sartorelli AC;Okunieff P	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
641	11817695	Zinc uptake by human erythrocytes with and without serum albumins in the medium.	Different mechanisms of Zn uptake are present in mammalian cells. The variations in the Zn uptake by human erythrocytes in the absence and presence of albumins, bovine and human, as well as the differences of Zn uptake with and without 4-4'-diidothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid have been analyzed in this study. The results show a significantly greater rate of Zn uptake in the absence rather than in the presence of albumins in the extracellular medium and being significantly greater with bovine than with human serum albumin when the experiments were performed in media with equimolar concentrations of Zn. However, when comparing Zn uptake in a medium without albumin with similar free-Zn concentration to Zn ultrafiltrable (20%) of other one with albumin, a significantly greater Zn uptake on the latter was observed. The DIDS inhibition on Zn uptake is higher if the albumin is also present in the medium. These results suggest that in Zn uptake by erythrocytes the albumin directly or indirectly would be involved, facilitating the well-known processes of passive transport and anionic exchanger.	eng	45	56	Biological trace element research	84	1-3	2001			D000418/Q000378;D000818;D000838;D001639/Q000378;D001692;D002417;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D007474;D007477;D012709/Q000378;D013997;D015032/Q000378;D015032/Q000493	Albumins/metabolism;Animals;Anions;Bicarbonates/metabolism;Biological Transport;Cattle;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Ion Exchange;Ions;Serum Albumin/metabolism;Time Factors;Zinc/metabolism;Zinc/pharmacokinetics	Gálvez M;Moreno JA;Elósegui LM;Escanero JF	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
642		Hereditary Orotic Aciduria and Other Disorders of Pyrimidine Metabolism	Pyrimidines and purines are the building blocks of DNA and RNA and are thus required for the retention and transmission of genetic information. In addition they function in the formation of coenzymes and active intermediates in carbohydrate and phospholipid metabolism. Purines and pyrimidines have two routes for nucleotide formation, the de novo pathway, which begins with ribose phosphate, amino acids, CO2, and ammonia; and the salvage pathway, which takes free bases and nucleosides back to nucleotides. De novo and salvage pathways are balanced and connected through the enzymes, which degrade the nucleotides to _-amino acids, CO2, and ammonia.In contrast to the well-known defects of purine metabolism, most of the seven defects of pyrimidine metabolism are recently discovered: hereditary orotic aciduria (UMP synthase deficiency; MIM 25890, 25892), pyrimidine 5_-nucleotidase deficiency (MIM 26612), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency (MIM 27427), dihydropyrimidinase (dihydropyrimidinuria, MIM), ureidopropionase deficiency, thymidine phosphorylase deficiency, and pyrimidine 5_-superactivity. Purine metabolism has an easily recognizable, easily measurable endpoint in uric acid. There is no equivalent compound in pyrimidine metabolism.The first defect, hereditary orotic aciduria, is in the de novo synthetic pathway. This autosomal recessive disorder results from a severe deficiency of the last two activities in the pathway, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine-5_-monophosphate decarboxylase. Although orotic aciduria was thought to be unique because of the loss of two enzymes, it is now known that these activities reside in separate domains of a single polypeptide coded by a single gene. This bifunctional protein, uridine-5_-monophosphate synthase, has been purified, the amino acid sequence determined by cDNA sequencing, and the gene localized to chromosome 3q13. Two point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions and loss of enzyme activity have been identified in one orotic aciduria patient.There are 15 known patients with hereditary orotic aciduria. All have had a macrocytic hypochromic megaloblastic anemia and orotic acid crystalluria. Thirteen have been treated with uridine with good effect in the majority. Five young adults remain well but require continued therapy. One adult has not received uridine therapy and is well despite persisting anemia. Other features have included renal tract obstruction by crystals, cardiac malformations, and strabismus. Infections have been a problem in some, associated with various abnormalities of in vitro tests of immune function. One patient had severe congenital abnormalities. Mild intellectual impairment has been an inconstant feature prior to treatment. The progressive neurologic deterioration in one young adult may be unrelated to the metabolic error.The other disorders involve defects in the pyrimidine degradative pathway. Deficiency of pyrimidine-5_-nucleotidase causes hemolytic anemia, possibly due to accumulation in erythrocytes of pyrimidine nucleotides, mostly uridine triphosphate (UTP) and cytidine triphosphate (CTP). The disorder is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner, and there is no specific treatment available. Pyrimidine 5_-nucleotidase superactivity has been described in four unrelated patients with developmental delay and neurologic abnormalities. The patients were treated with uridine with good effect. Deficiency of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase causes an increase in blood and urine levels of uracil and thymine. This deficiency is detected in a variety of clinical situations including pediatric metabolic screens for neurologic ...	eng						2001						Book, Section	Valle DL, Antonarakis S, Ballabio A, Beaudet AL, Mitchell GA	The Online Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease	McGraw-Hill Education	9.78007E+12	10.1036/ommbid.141		erythrocyte	True
643	11437348	RLIP76 is the major ATP-dependent transporter of glutathione-conjugates and doxorubicin in human erythrocytes.	We have recently demonstrated that RLIP76, a Ral-binding GTPase activating protein mediates ATP-dependent transport of glutathione (GSH) conjugates of electrophiles (GS-E) as well as doxorubicin (DOX), and that it is identical with DNP-SG ATPase, a GS-E transporter previously characterized by us in erythrocyte membranes (Awasthi et al. Biochemistry 39, 9327-9334). Multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) belonging to the family of the ABC-transporters has also been suggested to be a GS-E transporter in human erythrocytes. Using immunological approaches, the present studies were designed to elucidate the relative contributions of RLIP76, MRP1, and P-glycoprotein (Pgp), in the ATP-dependent transport of GS-E and DOX in human erythrocytes. In Western blot analyses using antibodies against RLIP76, a strong expression of RLIP76 was observed in erythrocytes. Immunohistochemical studies using a fluorescent probe showed association of RLIP76 with erythrocyte membrane, which was consistent with its transport function. Neither MRP1 nor Pgp were detected in erythrocytes when the antibodies against MRP1 or Pgp were used. In erythrocyte inside-out vesicles (IOVs) coated with antibodies against RLIP76, a dose-dependent inhibition of the ATP-dependent transport of DOX and GS-E, including S-(dinitrophenyl)glutathione (DNP-SG), leukotriene C(4), and the GSH conjugate of 4-hydroxynonenal, was observed with a maximal inhibition of about 70%. On the contrary, in the IOVs coated with the antibodies against MRP1 or Pgp no significant inhibition of the ATP-dependent transport of these compounds was observed. These findings suggest that RLIP76 is the major ATP-dependent transporter of GS-E and DOX in human erythrocytes.	eng	171	179	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics	391	2	2001	Jul	15	D020168/Q000276;D020168/Q000378;D018528/Q000276;D018528/Q000378;D000255/Q000378;D000970/Q000493;D001692;D002352/Q000378;D004317/Q000493;D004912/Q000378;D005455;D020690;D005978/Q000737;D005978/Q000378;D006801;D020014;D027425	ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/immunology;ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/immunology;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics;Biological Transport;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fluorescent Antibody Technique;GTPase-Activating Proteins;Glutathione/chemistry;Glutathione/metabolism;Humans;K562 Cells;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins	Sharma R;Singhal SS;Cheng J;Yang Y;Sharma A;Zimniak P;Awasthi S;Awasthi YC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
644	11428554	Determination, activity and biological role of adenylosuccinate lyase in blood cells.	Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency, which is associated with severe mental retardation and autistic features, was discovered in 1984. Since then this enzyme has been analyzed in many human tissues and it is now generally agreed that screening for this enzyme defect should be performed in all unexplained neurological diseases. The aim of the present study was to analyze adenylosuccinate lyase activity in blood cells by a fast simple method adaptable to screening purposes. The activity was also analyzed in B-lymphocytes from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The biological role of adenylosuccinate lyase and its importance in regulating cellular levels of AMP is discussed.	eng	277	283	Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie	55	5	2001	Jun		D000227/Q000097;D000264/Q000097;D000264/Q000502;D000368;D001402/Q000201;D002851;D006801;D015448/Q000201;D008875;D013056	Adenine Nucleotides/blood;Adenylosuccinate Lyase/blood;Adenylosuccinate Lyase/physiology;Aged;B-Lymphocytes/enzymology;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Humans;Leukemia, B-Cell/enzymology;Middle Aged;Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet	Tabucchi A;Carlucci F;Rosi F;Guerranti R;Marinello E	Journal, Articles								True
645	11294851	Mechanism of the formation and proteolytic release of H2O2-induced dityrosine and tyrosine oxidation products in hemoglobin and red blood cells.	Oxyhemoglobin exposed to a continuous flux of H(2)O(2) underwent oxidative modifications, including limited release of fluorescent fragmentation products. The main fragments formed were identified as oxidation products of tyrosine, including dopamine, dopamine quinone, and dihydroxyindol. Further release of these oxidation products plus dityrosine was only seen after proteolytic degradation of the oxidatively modified hemoprotein. A possible mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of these oxidation products that includes cyclization, decarboxylation, and further oxidation of the intermediates. Release of dityrosine is proposed as a useful technique for evaluating selective proteolysis after an oxidative stress, because dityrosine is metabolically stable, and it is only released after enzymatic hydrolysis of the oxidatively modified protein. The measurement can be accomplished by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection or by high efficiency thin layer chromatography. Comparable results, in terms of dityrosine release, were obtained using red blood cells of different sources after exposing them to a flux of H(2)O(2). Furthermore, dityrosine has been reported to occur in a wide variety of oxidatively modified proteins. These observations suggest that dityrosine formation and release can be used as a highly specific marker for protein oxidation and selective proteolysis.	eng	24129	24136	The Journal of biological chemistry	276	26	2001	Jun	29	D015415/Q000032;D002478;D003653;D004298/Q000031;D004298/Q000378;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D006454/Q000737;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D006861/Q000494;D008958;D010084;D018384;D010108/Q000737;D010108/Q000187;D010108/Q000378;D014443/Q000031;D014443/Q000378	Biomarkers/analysis;Cells, Cultured;Decarboxylation;Dopamine/analogs & derivatives;Dopamine/metabolism;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemoglobins/chemistry;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology;Models, Molecular;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Oxyhemoglobins/chemistry;Oxyhemoglobins/drug effects;Oxyhemoglobins/metabolism;Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives;Tyrosine/metabolism	Giulivi C;Davies KJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
646	11283793	Transaldolase deficiency: liver cirrhosis associated with a new inborn error in the pentose phosphate pathway.	This article describes the first patient with a deficiency of transaldolase (TALDO1 [E.C.2.2.1.2]). Clinically, the patient presented with liver cirrhosis and hepatosplenomegaly during early infancy. In urine and plasma, elevated concentrations of ribitol, D-arabitol, and erythritol were found. By incubating the patient's lymphoblasts and erythrocytes with ribose-5-phosphate and subsequently analyzing phosphate sugar metabolites, we discovered a deficiency of transaldolase. Sequence analysis of the transaldolase gene from this patient showed a homozygous deletion of 3 bp. This deletion results in absence of serine at position 171 of the transaldolase protein. This amino acid is invariable between species and is located in a conserved region, indicating its importance for enzyme activity. The detection of this new inborn error of pentose metabolism has implications for the diagnostic workup of liver problems of unknown etiology.	eng	1086	1092	American journal of human genetics	68	5	2001	May		D000595;D001483;D002648;D002675;D017124/Q000235;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006720;D006801;D007231;D008099/Q000473;D008103/Q000201;D008103/Q000235;D008103/Q000378;D008214/Q000378;D008297;D008661/Q000201;D008661/Q000235;D008661/Q000378;D008969;D010427/Q000235;D010429/Q000097;D010429/Q000652;D012333/Q000235;D012333/Q000378;D012267/Q000378;D017384/Q000235;D013154/Q000473;D013402/Q000097;D013402/Q000652;D014153/Q000172;D014153/Q000235;D014153/Q000378;D014174/Q000378	Amino Acid Sequence;Base Sequence;Child;Child, Preschool;Conserved Sequence/genetics;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Homozygote;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Liver/pathology;Liver Cirrhosis/enzymology;Liver Cirrhosis/genetics;Liver Cirrhosis/metabolism;Lymphocytes/metabolism;Male;Metabolism, Inborn Errors/enzymology;Metabolism, Inborn Errors/genetics;Metabolism, Inborn Errors/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Pentose Phosphate Pathway/genetics;Pentoses/blood;Pentoses/urine;RNA, Messenger/genetics;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Ribosemonophosphates/metabolism;Sequence Deletion/genetics;Spleen/pathology;Sugar Alcohols/blood;Sugar Alcohols/urine;Transaldolase/deficiency;Transaldolase/genetics;Transaldolase/metabolism;Transketolase/metabolism	Verhoeven NM;Huck JH;Roos B;Struys EA;Salomons GS;Douwes AC;van der Knaap MS;Jakobs C	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
647	11669302	Protein kinase C isoforms in human erythrocytes.	Erythrocytes are the most abundant cells in blood and carry out the vital function of oxygen transport. These cells lack nuclei and do not synthesise new proteins. Their cellular responses are modulated entirely by post-translational modifications in existing proteins. Phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) plays a significant role in red cell physiology. To date PKC alpha and zeta are the only isoforms reported to be expressed in erythrocytes. Upon activation they influence cytoskeletal integrity and erythrocyte functions. In this study we report for the first time the presence of PKC iota and PKC mu in addition to PKC alpha and zeta in human erythrocytes. All isoforms were present only in the cytosolic fraction. PKC alpha was the only isoform that translocated to the membrane upon stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). It could thus mediate several of the reported PMA-regulated membrane modifications. Investigations on alterations in PMA-mediated phosphorylation of erythrocyte skeletal components in disorders such as chronic myeloid leukaemia can now focus on PKC alpha, which is the only isoform in erythrocytes, which translocates to the membrane on stimulation of the cells.	eng	531	534	Annals of hematology	80	9	2001	Sep		D004789;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007527/Q000097;D011493/Q000097	Enzyme Activation;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Isoenzymes/blood;Protein Kinase C/blood	Govekar RB;Zingde SM	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

649	12432216	Gene expression and biological significance of hexokinase in erythroid cells.	Red blood cells (RBCs) express two hexokinase (HK) isoforms, HK-I and HK-R. Both isozymes are generated from the HK-I gene by use of an alternate promoter. Gene structure and exon-intron organization of the HK-I gene have been elucidated from a sequence of three contiguous genomic clones localized at human chromosome 10. The sequence spans about 131 kb, and consists of 25 exons, which include 6 testis- and 1 erythroid-specific exons. HK-R has been shown as an erythroid-specific isozyme whose expression is turned on in the early erythroid-progenitors and is significantly induced during their differentiation. HK-R unfolds major HK activity in immature RBCs and is rapidly degraded during the maturation process. HK-I has a porin-binding domain in its N-terminus. Recent studies have shown that HK isozymes with a porin-binding domain play a role in mitochondrial integrity, suggesting that HK-I-deficient erythroid cells might be eliminated by apoptosis. It is most likely that RBCs are most labile as a result of HK-I/R deficiency since the HK-I gene but not the other isozyme genes are expressed in fetal and adult RBCs.	eng	204	209	Acta haematologica	108	4	2002			D000743/Q000201;D000743/Q000473;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000473;D015870;D006593/Q000172;D006593/Q000235;D006801;D007527/Q000172;D007527/Q000235;D011401/Q000235	Anemia, Hemolytic/enzymology;Anemia, Hemolytic/pathology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/pathology;Gene Expression;Hexokinase/deficiency;Hexokinase/genetics;Humans;Isoenzymes/deficiency;Isoenzymes/genetics;Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics	Murakami K;Kanno H;Tancabelic J;Fujii H	Journal, Articles							RBC;Red blood cell;Erythrocyte;erythro	True
650	11861637	Identification of the erythrocyte Rh blood group glycoprotein as a mammalian ammonium transporter.	The Rh blood group proteins are well known as the erythrocyte targets of the potent antibody response that causes hemolytic disease of the newborn. These proteins have been described in molecular detail; however, little is known about their function. A transport function is suggested by their predicted structure and from phylogenetic analysis. To obtain evidence for a role in solute transport, we expressed Rh proteins in Xenopus oocytes and now demonstrate that the erythroid Rh-associated glycoprotein mediates uptake of ammonium across cell membranes. Rh-associated glycoprotein carrier-mediated uptake, characterized with the radioactive analog of ammonium [(14)C]methylamine (MA), had an apparent EC(50) of 1.6 mm and a maximum uptake rate (V(max)) of 190 pmol/oocyte/min. Uptake was independent of the membrane potential and the Na(+) gradient. MA transport was stimulated by raising extracellular pH or by lowering intracellular pH, suggesting that uptake was coupled to an outwardly directed H(+) gradient. MA uptake was insensitive to additions of amiloride, amine-containing compounds tetramethyl- and tetraethylammonium chloride, glutamine, and urea. However, MA uptake was significantly antagonized by ammonium chloride with inhibition kinetics (IC(50) = 1.14 mm) consistent with the hypothesis that the uptake of MA and ammonium involves a similar H(+)-coupled counter-transport mechanism.	eng	12499	12502	The Journal of biological chemistry	277	15	2002	Apr	12	D000818;D001798;D002352/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006023/Q000378;D006023/Q000502;D006031;D006801;D007700;D008562/Q000378;D008562/Q000502;D009865/Q000378;D000644/Q000378;D011994/Q000378;D012204;D014981	Animals;Blood Proteins;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycoproteins/metabolism;Glycoproteins/physiology;Glycosylation;Humans;Kinetics;Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism;Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology;Oocytes/metabolism;Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Rh-Hr Blood-Group System;Xenopus	Westhoff CM;Ferreri-Jacobia M;Mak DO;Foskett JK	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
651	12180982	Xanthosine and xanthine. Substrate properties with purine nucleoside phosphorylases, and relevance to other enzyme systems.	Substrate properties of xanthine (Xan) and xanthosine (Xao) for purine nucleoside phosphorylases (PNP) of mammalian origin have been reported previously, but only at a single arbitrarily selected pH and with no kinetic constants. Additionally, studies have not taken into account the fact that, at physiological pH, Xao (pKa = 5.7) is a monoanion, while Xan (pKa = 7.7) is an equilibrium mixture of the neutral and monoanionic forms. Furthermore the monoanionic forms, unlike those of guanosine (Guo) and inosine (Ino), and guanine (Gua) and hypoxanthine (Hx), are still 6-oxopurines. The optimum pH for PNP from human erythrocytes and calf spleen with both Xao and Xan is in the range 5-6, whereas those with Guo and Gua, and Ino and Hx, are in the range 7-8. The pH-dependence of substrate properties of Xao and Xan points to both neutral and anionic forms as substrates, with a marked preference for the neutral species. Both neutral and anionic forms of 6-thioxanthine (pKa = 6.5 +/- 0.1), but not of 2-thioxanthine (pKa = 5.9 +/- 0.1), are weaker substrates. Phosphorolysis of Xao to Xan by calf spleen PNP at pH 5.7 levels off at 83% conversion, due to equilibrium with the reverse synthetic pathway (equilibrium constant 0.05), and not by product inhibition. Replacement of Pi by arsenate led to complete arsenolysis of Xao. Kinetic parameters are reported for the phosphorolytic and reverse synthetic pathways at several selected pH values. Phosphorolysis of 200 micro m Xao by the human enzyme at pH 5.7 is inhibited by Guo (IC50 = 10 +/- 2 micro m), Hx (IC50 = 7 +/- 1 micro m) and Gua (IC50 = 4.0 +/- 0.2 micro m). With Gua, inhibition was shown to be competitive, with Ki = 2.0 +/- 0.3 micro m. By contrast, Xao and its products of phosphorolysis (Xan and R1P), were poor inhibitors of phosphorolysis of Guo, and Xan did not inhibit the reverse reaction with Gua. Possible modes of binding of the neutral and anionic forms of Xan and Xao by mammalian PNPs are proposed. Attention is directed to the fact that the structural properties of the neutral and ionic forms of XMP, Xao and Xan are also of key importance in many other enzyme systems, such as IMP dehydrogenase, some nucleic acid polymerases, biosynthesis of caffeine and phosphoribosyltransferases.	eng	4048	4057	European journal of biochemistry	269	16	2002	Aug		D000818;D002417;D004798/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D006147/Q000378;D006151/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D019271/Q000378;D007288/Q000378;D007700;D008956;D015394;D011485;D011683/Q000378;D012263/Q000737;D012263/Q000378;D013154/Q000201;D013329;D013379;D019820/Q000737;D019820/Q000378;D014970/Q000378	Animals;Cattle;Enzymes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Guanine/metabolism;Guanosine/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Hypoxanthine/metabolism;Inosine/metabolism;Kinetics;Models, Chemical;Molecular Structure;Protein Binding;Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/metabolism;Ribonucleosides/chemistry;Ribonucleosides/metabolism;Spleen/enzymology;Structure-Activity Relationship;Substrate Specificity;Xanthine/chemistry;Xanthine/metabolism;Xanthines/metabolism	Stoychev G;Kierdaszuk B;Shugar D	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
652	12228763	Formation of phosphatidylethanol in vitro in red blood cells from healthy volunteers and chronic alcoholics.	Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) is an abnormal phospholipid, formed only in the presence of ethanol via a transphosphatidylation reaction of phospholipase D (PLD). PEth in blood is a promising new marker of alcohol abuse. Blood PEth is found almost exclusively in red cells. This study was performed to investigate a possible PEth formation in human red cells from alcoholics and healthy individuals, at physiologically relevant ethanol concentrations. Blood was drawn from six healthy volunteers (controls) and six chronic inpatient alcoholics. Hematological analyses were performed, and red blood cells were separated and incubated in plasma with ethanol to study PEth formation. Lipids were extracted and PEth analyzed with high pressure liquid chromatography and evaporative light-scattering detection. Incubation of red cells in 50 mM ethanol yielded detectable PEth after 12 hours. Formation of PEth was concentration dependent at 10 to 50 mM ethanol. In vitro formation of PEth was significantly higher (P <.001) in red cells from alcoholics (5.2 +/- 1.1 micromol/l) compared to controls (2.4 +/- 0.6 micromol/l) (mean +/- SD). A significant correlation (P <.01) was observed between initial mean corpuscular volume and accumulated PEth. This study demonstrates that PEth is formed in human red cells at physiologically relevant ethanol concentrations. Alcoholics accumulate about twice as much PEth than controls. The accumulation rate of PEth is slower in red cells compared to rates reported for other tissues.	eng	79	83	The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine	140	2	2002	Aug		D000328;D000368;D000437/Q000175;D000437/Q000378;D015415;D002492/Q000493;D002851;D004912/Q000378;D000431/Q000493;D005260;D020404/Q000032;D020404/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D008297;D008875;D010739/Q000378	Adult;Aged;Alcoholism/diagnosis;Alcoholism/metabolism;Biomarkers;Central Nervous System Depressants/pharmacokinetics;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Ethanol/pharmacokinetics;Female;Glycerophospholipids/analysis;Glycerophospholipids/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Male;Middle Aged;Phospholipase D/metabolism	Varga A;Alling C	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
653	11975663	Fructosamine 3-kinase is involved in an intracellular deglycation pathway in human erythrocytes.	Fructosamine 3-kinase, which phosphorylates low-molecular-mass and protein-bound fructosamines on the third carbon of their deoxyfructose moiety, is quite active in erythrocytes, and was proposed to initiate a process removing fructosamine residues from proteins. In the present study, we show that incubation of human erythrocytes with 200 mM glucose not only caused the progressive formation of glycated haemoglobin, but also increased the level of an anionic form of haemoglobin containing alkali-labile phosphate, to approx. 5% of total haemoglobin. 1-Deoxy-1-morpholinofructose (DMF), a substrate and competitive inhibitor of fructosamine 3-kinase, doubled the rate of accumulation of glycated haemoglobin, but markedly decreased the amount of haemoglobin containing alkali-labile phosphate. The latter corresponds therefore to haemoglobin bound to a fructosamine 3-phosphate group (FN3P-Hb). Returning erythrocytes incubated with 200 mM glucose and DMF to a low-glucose medium devoid of DMF caused a decrease in the amount of glycated haemoglobin, a transient increase in FN3P-Hb and a net decrease in the sum (glycated haemoglobin+FN3P-Hb). These effects were prevented by DMF, indicating that fructosamine 3-kinase is involved in the removal of fructosamine residues. The second step of this 'deglycation' process is most likely a spontaneous decomposition of the fructosamine 3-phosphate residues to a free amine, 3-deoxyglucosone and P(i). This is consistent with the findings that 2-oxo-3-deoxygluconate, the product of 3-deoxyglucosone oxidation, is formed in erythrocytes incubated for 2 days with 200 mM glucose in a sufficient amount to account for the removal of fructosamine residues from proteins, and that DMF appears to inhibit the formation of 2-oxo-3-deoxygluconate from elevated glucose concentrations.	eng	801	808	The Biochemical journal	365	Pt 3	2002	Aug	01	D004912/Q000201;D005632/Q000031;D005632/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D006442/Q000378;D006801;D008239/Q000031;D008239/Q000378;D015394;D009025/Q000378;D010766;D017853/Q000378;D011994/Q000378	Erythrocytes/enzymology;Fructose/analogs & derivatives;Fructose/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Glycated Hemoglobin/metabolism;Humans;Lysine/analogs & derivatives;Lysine/metabolism;Molecular Structure;Morpholines/metabolism;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism	Delpierre G;Collard F;Fortpied J;Van Schaftingen E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
654	12435804	Discovery of novel targets of quinoline drugs in the human purine binding proteome.	The quinolines have been used in the treatment of malaria, arthritis, and lupus for many years, yet the precise mechanism of their action remains unclear. In this study, we used a functional proteomics approach that exploited the structural similarities between the quinoline compounds and the purine ring of ATP to identify quinoline-binding proteins. Several quinoline drugs were screened by displacement affinity chromatography against the purine binding proteome captured with gamma-phosphate-linked ATP-Sepharose. Screening of the human red blood cell purine binding proteome identified two human proteins, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) and quinone reductase 2 (QR2). In contrast, no proteins were detected upon screening of the Plasmodium falciparum purine binding proteome with the quinolines. In a complementary approach, we passed cell lysates from mice, red blood cells, or P. falciparum over hydroxychloroquine- or primaquine-Sepharose. Consistent with the displacement affinity chromatography screen, ALDH and QR2 were the only proteins recovered from mice and human red blood cell lysate and no proteins were recovered from P. falciparum. Furthermore, the activity of QR2 was potently inhibited by several of the quinolines in vitro. Our results show that ALDH1 and QR2 are selective targets of the quinolines and may provide new insights into the mechanism of action of these drugs.	eng	1364	1372	Molecular pharmacology	62	6	2002	Dec		D000255/Q000378;D000444/Q000037;D000444/Q000302;D000444/Q000378;D000080924;D000818;D000962/Q000737;D000962/Q000378;D002738/Q000737;D002738/Q000378;D002847;D004791/Q000494;D004912/Q000737;D006801;D007527/Q000037;D007527/Q000302;D007527/Q000378;D015767/Q000737;D015767/Q000378;D051379;D016660/Q000037;D016660/Q000302;D016660/Q000378;D010963/Q000737;D010963/Q000187;D010963/Q000254;D011319/Q000737;D011319/Q000378;D020543/Q000378;D050697;D012685/Q000737	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/isolation & purification;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/metabolism;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family;Animals;Antimalarials/chemistry;Antimalarials/metabolism;Chloroquine/chemistry;Chloroquine/metabolism;Chromatography, Agarose;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Humans;Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Mefloquine/chemistry;Mefloquine/metabolism;Mice;NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/antagonists & inhibitors;NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/isolation & purification;NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/metabolism;Plasmodium falciparum/chemistry;Plasmodium falciparum/drug effects;Plasmodium falciparum/growth & development;Primaquine/chemistry;Primaquine/metabolism;Proteome/metabolism;Retinal Dehydrogenase;Sepharose/chemistry	Graves PR;Kwiek JJ;Fadden P;Ray R;Hardeman K;Coley AM;Foley M;Haystead TA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
655	11795870	Human erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase, PN-I.	Erythrocyte maturation is accompanied by RNA degradation and release of mononucleotides. Pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase, PN-I, has been purified and characterized. The molecular and enzymatic properties determined for the enzyme shows a 36-kDa and 5.1 pI monomeric protein with no disulfide bridges and no phosphate content. The activity is dependent on Mg(2+), while it is inactivated by heavy metals and by thiol-reactive reagents. PN-I is specific for pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphates, including the antineoplastic agents 5'-AZTMP and 5'-Ara-CMP. PN-I possess phosphotransferase activity able to exchange phosphate between pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphates and pyrimidine nucleosides, including AZT and Ara-Cyd. Amino acid sequence has been obtained from tryptic and CNBr peptides. PN-I cDNA sequence, coding for a 286-residue protein, has been retrieved from tag database, amplified by PCR, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was fully active and showed identical properties with respect to PN-I. Substantial identity has been revealed with the partial sequences reported for p36, an alpha-interferon-induced protein. The significance of this identity is discussed.	eng	184	190	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics	397	2	2002	Jan	15	D015720/Q000378;D000595;D001483;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D008969;D010770/Q000378;D013379	5'-Nucleotidase/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Base Sequence;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Molecular Sequence Data;Phosphotransferases/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Amici A;Magni G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

657	12453637	Characterization of a sialate pyruvate-lyase in the cytosol of human erythrocytes.	Sialate pyruvate-lyases, also known as sialate aldolases (EC 4.1.3.3), reversibly catalyse the cleavage of free N-acetylneuraminic acids to form pyruvate and N-acetylmannosamine. These enzymes are widely distributed and are present in numerous pro- and eukaryotic cells, in which they are localized only in the cytosol. They play an important role in the regulation of sialic acid metabolism by controlling the intracellular concentration of sialic acids of biosynthetic or exogenous origin, thus preventing the accumulation of toxic levels of this sugar. Application of an original colorimetric micromethod for N-acetylmannosamine determination, as well as the use of [4,5,6,7,8,9-14C]N-acetylneuraminic acid, led us to evidence a cytosolic neuraminate aldolase activity in human red blood cells (RBCs) and then to define the main characteristics of this enzyme: Michaelis-Menten type, K(m:) 1.4 +/- 0.05 mM, optimal pH: 7.6 +/- 0.2, optimal temperature: 70 +/- 2 degrees C, inhibition by heavy metals: Ag(+) and Hg(++). These enzyme parameters are close to those of the bacterial and mammalian aldolases described up to now. At the moment, the presence of sialate pyruvate-lyase in the cytosol of red blood cells remains an enigma.	eng	655	660	Biochimie	84	7	2002	Jul		D001345;D002250;D002384;D002412/Q000494;D002855;D003600/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008670/Q000494;D019158/Q000737;D019158/Q000378;D007652/Q000097;D019289/Q000494;D013379;D013696;D013997	Autoradiography;Carbon Radioisotopes;Catalysis;Cations/pharmacology;Chromatography, Thin Layer;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Metals/pharmacology;N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/chemistry;N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/metabolism;Oxo-Acid-Lyases/blood;Pyruvic Acid/pharmacology;Substrate Specificity;Temperature;Time Factors	Bulai T;Bratosin D;Artenie V;Montreuil J	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
658	12070037	Band 3 is an anchor protein and a target for SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase in human erythrocytes.	Tyr phosphorylation of the multifunctional transmembrane protein band 3 has been implicated in several erythrocyte functions and disorders. We previously demonstrated that pervanadate treatment of human erythrocytes induces band-3 Tyr phosphorylation, which is catalyzed by the sequential action of tyrosine kinase Syk and tyrosine kinase(s) belonging to the Src family. In this study, we show that Tyr phosphorylation of band 3, elicited by pervanadate, N-ethylmaleimide, or diamide, greatly increases band-3 interaction with the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in parallel with the translocation of SHP-2 to erythrocyte membranes. These events seem to be mediated by Src-like catalyzed phosphorylation of band 3 because both SHP-2 translocation to cellular membranes and its interaction with Tyr-phosphorylated protein are greatly counteracted by PP2, a specific inhibitor of Src kinases. Binding-competition experiments demonstrate that SHP-2 recruitment to band 3 occurs via its SH2 domain(s). In particular, our data support the view that SHP-2 docks specifically with P-Y359 of band 3. Experiments performed with intact erythrocytes in the presence of the SHP-2 inhibitor calpeptin suggest that, once recruited to Tyr-phosphorylated band 3, the tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylates the protein. P-Y8, 21, and 904 are the residues affected by SHP-2, as judged by (32)P-peptide mapping of band 3 digested with trypsin. These results indicate that in treated erythrocytes, recruitment of cytosolic SHP-2 to band 3 is a prerequisite for the subsequent dephosphorylation of the transmembrane protein.	eng	276	282	Blood	100	1	2002	Jul	01	D001457/Q000378;D001665;D002462/Q000737;D002462/Q000378;D003600/Q000737;D003600/Q000378;D004791/Q000494;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D047908;D010766/Q000187;D011485;D021381;D054592;D017027/Q000037;D017027/Q000378;D054593	Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Binding Sites;Cell Membrane/chemistry;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Cytosol/chemistry;Cytosol/metabolism;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins;Phosphorylation/drug effects;Protein Binding;Protein Transport;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism;SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases	Bordin L;Brunati AM;Donella-Deana A;Baggio B;Toninello A;Clari G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
659	12082497	Increased red cell sodium-lithium countertransport and lymphocyte cytosolic calcium are separate phenotypes in patients with essential hypertension.	Increased red blood cell sodium-lithium countertransport (SLC) activity and elevated intracellular calcium have been observed in hypertensive patients. The association of these ion transport abnormalities with each other and with another phenotype, insulin resistance, has been suggested. We investigated whether elevated SLC activity and increased lymphocyte cytosolic calcium (Ca(cyt)) occur in the same individuals and whether either is associated with hyperinsulinaemia. We measured SLC activity, lymphocyte Ca(cyt)and fasting insulin levels in hypertensive patients and normal subjects. Consistent with prior studies, SLC activity was significantly and positively correlated with fasting insulin levels (r = 0.45, P < 0.01). However, SLC activity and lymphocyte Ca(cyt) were significantly but inversely correlated (r = -0.42, P < 0.01) and lymphocyte Ca(cyt) was also inversely correlated with fasting insulin (r = -0.55, P < 0.001). When the study participants were instead separated into two groups based on fasting insulin levels, those above the median (15 microU/ml) had significantly higher SLC activity and significantly lower Ca(cyt). When separated by lymphocyte Ca(cyt) levels (above or below 120 nM) those patients with low lymphocyte Ca(cyt) had significantly higher SLC activity and significantly higher insulin levels. Multiple linear regression showed that fasting insulin was significantly predictive of SLC activity (P = 0.05) and Ca(cyt) (P < 0.01). Thus, elevated SLC activity and increased lymphocyte Ca(cyt) are separate and distinct ion transport phenotypes in hypertensive patients, linked through a relationship to hyperinsulinaemia that is direct with SLC activity and inverse with lymphocyte Ca(cyt).	eng	353	358	Journal of human hypertension	16	5	2002	May		D000328;D017920/Q000378;D001692;D002118/Q000097;D003600/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005215;D005260;D006801;D006973/Q000097;D007328/Q000097;D008214/Q000378;D008297;D010641	Adult;Antiporters/metabolism;Biological Transport;Calcium/blood;Cytosol/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fasting;Female;Humans;Hypertension/blood;Insulin/blood;Lymphocytes/metabolism;Male;Phenotype	Romero JR;Rivera A;Monari A;Ceolotto G;Semplicini A;Conlin PR	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True

Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) catalyses the inactivation of catecholamines. It is widely distnbuted in most tissues in soluble (S-COMT) and membrane-bound (MB-COMT) forms.

In order to investigate whether this is true for human hypertension, we have evaluated the erythrocyte COMT assay in humans.	eng	589	594	Annals of clinical biochemistry	39	Pt 6	2002	Nov		D000328;D000368;D002394/Q000032;D002394/Q000378;D002851;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007700;D008297;D008875;D009638/Q000378;D015203;D013379;D013997	Adult;Aged;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/analysis;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/metabolism;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Kinetics;Male;Middle Aged;Norepinephrine/metabolism;Reproducibility of Results;Substrate Specificity;Time Factors	Masuda M;Tsunoda M;Yusa Y;Yamada S;Imai K	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
661	12384442	Phorbol ester stimulates a protein kinase C-mediated agatoxin-TK-sensitive calcium permeability pathway in human red blood cells.	Calcium entry into mature erythrocytes (red blood cells; RBCs) is associated with multiple changes in cell properties. At low intracellular Ca(2+), efflux of potassium and water predominates, leading to changes in erythrocyte rheology. At higher Ca(2+) content, activation of kinases and phosphatases, rupture of membrane-to-skeleton bridges, stimulation of a phospholipid scramblase and phospholipase C, and induction of transglutaminase-mediated protein cross-linking are also observed. Because the physiologic relevance of these latter responses depends partially on whether Ca(2+) entry involves a regulated channel or nonspecific leak, we explored mechanisms that initiate controlled Ca(2+) influx. Protein kinase C (PKC) was considered a prime candidate for the pathway regulator, and phorbol-12 myristate-13 acetate (PMA), a stimulator of PKC, was examined for its influence on erythrocyte Ca(2+). PMA was found to stimulate a rapid, dose-dependent influx of calcium, as demonstrated by the increased fluorescence of an entrapped Ca(2+)-sensitive dye, Fluo-3/AM. The PMA-induced entry was inhibited by staurosporine and the PKC-selective inhibitor chelerythrine chloride, but was activated by the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A. The PMA-promoted calcium influx was also inhibited by omega-agatoxin-TK, a calcium channel blocker specific for Ca(v)2.1 channels. To confirm that a Ca(v)2.1-like calcium channel exists in the mature erythrocyte membrane, RBC membrane preparations were immunoblotted with antiserum against the alpha(1A) subunit of the channel. A polypeptide of the expected molecular weight (190 kDa) was visualized. These studies indicate that an omega-agatoxin-TK-sensitive, Ca(v)2.1-like calcium permeability pathway is present in the RBC membrane and that it may function under the control of kinases and phosphatases.	eng	3392	3399	Blood	100	9	2002	Nov	01	D000328;D060848;D000470;D053119;D000001/Q000494;D002118/Q000097;D002121/Q000494;D020864/Q000187;D020864/Q000378;D020013;D048429/Q000187;D004075/Q000494;D004121/Q000494;D004791/Q000494;D004912/Q000187;D006801;D017136/Q000187;D007476/Q000494;D008387;D019319/Q000494;D009996;D010080/Q000494;D010617/Q000494;D010749/Q000037;D011493/Q000037;D011493/Q000502;D013111/Q000494;D019311/Q000494;D013755/Q000494	Adult;Agatoxins;Alkaloids;Benzophenanthridines;Calcimycin/pharmacology;Calcium/blood;Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology;Calcium Channels, N-Type/drug effects;Calcium Channels, N-Type/metabolism;Calcium Signaling;Cell Size/drug effects;Diglycerides/pharmacology;Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Humans;Ion Transport/drug effects;Ionophores/pharmacology;Marine Toxins;Okadaic Acid/pharmacology;Osmotic Fragility;Oxazoles/pharmacology;Phenanthridines/pharmacology;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors;Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors;Protein Kinase C/physiology;Spider Venoms/pharmacology;Staurosporine/pharmacology;Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology	Andrews DA;Yang L;Low PS	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
662	12388775	Na pump isoforms in human erythroid progenitor cells and mature erythrocytes.	This study is aimed at identifying the Na pump isoform composition of human erythroid precursor cells and mature human erythrocytes. We used purified and synchronously growing human erythroid progenitor cells cultured for 7-14 days. RNA was extracted from the progenitor cells on different days and analyzed by RT-PCR. The results showed that only the alpha1, alpha3, beta2, and beta3 subunit isoforms and the gamma modulator were present. Northern analysis of the erythroid progenitor cells again showed that beta2 but not beta1 or alpha2 isoforms were present. The erythroid cells display a unique beta subunit expression profile (called beta-profiling) in that they contain the message for the beta2 isoform but not beta1, whereas leukocytes and platelets are known to have the message for the beta1 but not for the beta2 isoform. This finding is taken to indicate that our preparations are essentially purely erythroid and free from white cell contamination. Western analysis of these cultured progenitor cells confirmed the presence of alpha1, alpha3, (no alpha2), beta2, beta3, and gamma together now with clear evidence that beta1 protein was also present at all stages. Western analysis of the Na pump from mature human erythrocyte ghosts, purified by ouabain column chromatography, has also shown that alpha1, alpha3, beta1, beta2, beta3, and gamma are present. Thus, the Na pump isoform composition of human erythroid precursor cells and mature erythrocytes contains the alpha1 and alpha3 isoforms of the alpha subunit, the beta1, beta2, and beta3 isoforms of the beta subunit, and the gamma modulator.	eng	14572	14577	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	99	22	2002	Oct	29	D002478;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000201;D015672/Q000166;D015672/Q000201;D006801;D007527;D012333;D000254/Q000235;D000254/Q000378	Cells, Cultured;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology;Erythroid Precursor Cells/enzymology;Humans;Isoenzymes;RNA, Messenger;Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/genetics;Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/metabolism	Hoffman JF;Wickrema A;Potapova O;Milanick M;Yingst DR	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;Erythro;erythrocyte;erythro	True
663	12009299	NADPH-dependent GMP reductase isoenzyme of human (GMPR2). Expression, purification, and kinetic properties.	GMP reductase (EC 1.6.6.8) is the only known metabolic step by which guanine nucleotides can be converted to the pivotal precursor of both adenine and guanine nucleotides. Human GMP reductase has been previously partially purified from erythrocytes and a chromosome 6-linked cDNA has been identified to correspond for encoding human GMP reductase. Here, we reported a distinct cDNA for human GMP reductase isoenzyme isolated from a human fetal brain library, and the GenBank accession number is AF419346. The deduced protein shows 90% identity with human GMP reductase reported (named GMPR1 compared with GMPR2 of this paper) and 69% with E. coli GMP reductase. Comparison of GMPR2 cDNA sequence with human genome indicates the corresponding gene spans about 6.6kb on chromosome 14, which encodes 348 amino acid residues. Northern hybridization analysis indicates a differential and disproportionate expression of mRNAs for GMPR1 and GMPR2, suggesting the existence of distinct molecular species of GMP reductase in human. The apparent Km of GMPR2 for NADPH and GMP are 26.6 and 17.4 microM, respectively. This is the first report suggesting the existence of two distinct types of human GMP reductase molecular species, which can be used to explain the bimodal saturation curve noted with the purified human erythrocyte GMP reductase.	eng	1035	1050	The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology	34	9	2002	Sep		D000595;D000818;D001483;D002413/Q000378;D002851;D002883;D050899;D015723;D006801;D006863;D007527/Q000737;D007527/Q000235;D007527/Q000302;D007527/Q000378;D008969;D009247/Q000737;D009247/Q000235;D009247/Q000302;D009247/Q000378;D009249/Q000378;D016415;D014018	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Base Sequence;Cations, Divalent/metabolism;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14;GMP Reductase;Gene Library;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Isoenzymes/chemistry;Isoenzymes/genetics;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/chemistry;NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/genetics;NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/isolation & purification;NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/metabolism;NADP/metabolism;Sequence Alignment;Tissue Distribution	Deng Y;Wang Z;Ying K;Gu S;Ji C;Huang Y;Gu X;Wang Y;Xu Y;Li Y;Xie Y;Mao Y	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
664	12125098	Glyceraldehyde metabolism in human erythrocytes in comparison with that of glucose and dihydroxyacetone.	Metabolism of D-glyceraldehyde in human erythrocytes in comparison with that of glucose and dihydroxyacetone was studied. Both trioses were metabolized to produce L-lactate at rates comparable to that of L-lactate formation from glucose. Almost complete inactivation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase by treatment of cells with iodoacetate resulted in a 95% decrease in L-lactate formation from the ketotriose as well as from glucose, whereas L-lactate formation from the aldotriose was only partially reduced (60%). D-Lactate was produced faster from either the aldotriose or the ketotriose than from glucose, but the ability of the two trioses to produce D-lactate was far lower than that to produce L-lactate. Almost complete inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase by disulfiram and of both aldose reductase and aldehyde reductase II by sorbinil, had no effect on L-lactate formation from D-glyceraldehyde. The present study suggests that D-glyceraldehyde is metabolized via two or more pathways including the glycolytic pathway after its phosphorylation by triokinase, and that neither oxidation to D-glyceric acid nor reduction to glycerol is a prerequisite for D-glyceraldehyde metabolism.	eng	223	226	Cell biochemistry and function	20	3	2002	Sep		D050260;D004098/Q000378;D004221/Q000494;D004791/Q000494;D004912/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D005985/Q000378;D024581/Q000378;D006019;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D007093/Q000494;D048289;D007461/Q000494;D007773/Q000378	Carbohydrate Metabolism;Dihydroxyacetone/metabolism;Disulfiram/pharmacology;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Glyceraldehyde/metabolism;Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (Phosphorylating)/metabolism;Glycolysis;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Imidazoles/pharmacology;Imidazolidines;Iodoacetates/pharmacology;Lactates/metabolism	Taguchi T;Murase S;Miwa I	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

666	12362340	Separation of human erythrocyte membrane associated proteins with one-dimensional and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by identification with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry.	"A classical proteomic analysis was used to establish a reference map of proteins associated with healthy human erythrocyte ghosts. Following osmotic lysis and differential centrifugation, ghost proteins were separated by either one-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1-DE) or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Selected protein bands or spots were excised and trypsinized before mass spectrometric analyses and data mining was performed using the SWISS-PROT and NCBI nonredundant databases. A total of 102 protein spots from a 2-D gel were successfully identified. These corresponded to 59 distinct polypeptides with the remaining 43 being isoforms. As for the 1-D gel, 44 polypeptides were identified, of which 19 were also found on the 2-D gel. Most of the 19 common polypeptides were membrane cytoskeletal proteins that are often referred to as the ""band"" proteins. The remaining 25 polypeptides that were found exclusively on 1-D gels were proteins with high hydrophobicity (e.g., sorbitol dehydrogenase and glucose transporter) and high molecular mass (e.g., Kell blood group glycoprotein and Janus-kinase 2). A higher number of signaling proteins was also identified on 1-D gels compared to 2-D gels.

667	12765793	Uptake of sialic acid by human erythrocyte. Characterization of a transport system.	Upon incubation of human red blood cells (RBC) with [4-9-14C] N-acetylneuraminic acid, the cells incorporated this sugar, as demonstrated by the identification of labelled N-acetylmannosamine in the cytosol, as a result of the action of the sialic acid pyruvate-lyase we discovered previously (Biochimie 84 (2002) 655). The mechanism is saturable and indicates the presence of a limited number of transporter molecules in the RBC membrane. This transport process may have relevance to the desialylation of membrane glycoconjugates which occurs during ageing of erythrocytes.	eng	241	244	Biochimie	85	1-2	2003			D001345;D001692;D002250;D002855;D003600/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D019158/Q000378;D027361/Q000378;D007652/Q000378;D012794/Q000097;D012794/Q000378;D027981/Q000378	Autoradiography;Biological Transport;Carbon Radioisotopes;Chromatography, Thin Layer;Cytosol/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/metabolism;Organic Anion Transporters/metabolism;Oxo-Acid-Lyases/metabolism;Sialic Acids/blood;Sialic Acids/metabolism;Symporters/metabolism	Bulai T;Bratosin D;Artenie V;Montreuil J	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
668	14621069	Polyamine levels and ornithine decarboxylase activity in blood and erythrocytes in human diseases.	Serum and erythrocyte levels of the polyamines spermine, spermidine and putrescine, as well as ornithine decarboxylase in erythrocytes, were studied in patients with different neoplasms (breast, lung and colon cancer) and in those with a nonmalignant proliferative disease (familial polyposis). The blood levels of polyamines and the spermine/putrescine ratio were significantly higher in all tumors and in nonmalignant colon polyposis. In erythrocyte ornithine decarboxylase activity, spermine and spermidine levels, as well as spermidine/putrescine and spermine/putrescine ratios showed a significant decrease after surgery and chemotherapy. Our data suggest that high levels of blood polyamines and erythrocyte ornithine decarboxylase activity are related to cell proliferation and cancer treatment, but that levels of polyamines in serum and erythrocytes are still significantly high after cancer treatment and are similar to those in polyposis disease. Polyamines are related to nuclear activity during differentiation; therefore, the altered turnover of polyamines could be a sign of abnormal nuclear function. Since polyamines stimulate protooncogene expression, their high levels could be considered an important cofactor in malignant cell transformation.	eng	17	22	International journal of clinical pharmacology research	23	1	2003			D000230/Q000097;D000230/Q000188;D000230/Q000201;D000970/Q000494;D000970/Q000627;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D009955/Q000097;D011073/Q000097	Adenocarcinoma/blood;Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy;Adenocarcinoma/enzymology;Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology;Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Ornithine Decarboxylase/blood;Polyamines/blood	Stabellini G;Calastrini C;Gagliano N;Dellavia C;Moscheni C;Vizzotto L;Occhionorelli S;Gioia M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
669	12669124	Store-mediated calcium entry in the regulation of phosphatidylserine exposure in blood cells from Scott patients.	Scott syndrome is a bleeding disorder, characterized by impaired surface exposure of procoagulant phosphatidylserine (PS) on platelets and other blood cells, following activation with Ca(2+)-elevating agents. Since store-mediated Ca(2+) entry (SMCE) forms an important part of the Ca(2+) response in various blood cells, it has been proposed that deficiencies in Ca(2+) entry may relate to the impaired PS exposure in the Scott syndrome. Here, we have tested this hypothesis by investigating the relationship between Ca(2+) fluxes and PS exposure in platelets as well as B-lymphoblasts derived from the original Scott patient (M.S.), a newly identified Welsh patient (V.W.) with similar bleeding symptoms, and two control subjects. Procoagulant activity of V.W. platelets in suspension, measured after stimulation with collagen/thrombin or Ca(2+)-ionophore, ionomycin, resulted in 52% or 17%, respectively, compared to that of correspondingly activated control platelets. Procoagulant activity of V.W. erythrocytes treated with Ca(2+)-ionophore resulted in less than 6% of the activity of control erythrocytes. Single-cell Ca(2+) responses of M.S. and V.W. platelets, adhering to collagen, were similar to those of platelets from control subjects, while PS exposure was reduced to 7% and 15%, respectively, compared to controls. Stimulation of non-apoptotic B-lymphoblasts derived from both patients and controls with Ca(2+)-ionophore or agents causing Ca(2+) mobilization and SMCE, resulted in similar Ca(2+) responses. However, in lymphoblasts from M.S. and V.W. Ca(2+)-induced PS exposure was reduced to 7% and 13% of the control lymphoblasts, respectively. We conclude that i. patient V.W. is a new case of Scott syndrome, ii. Ca(2+) entry in the platelets and lymphoblasts from both Scott patients is normal, and iii. elevated [Ca(2+)](i) as caused by SMCE is not sufficient to trigger PS exposure.	eng	687	695	Thrombosis and haemostasis	89	4	2003	Apr		D000328;D001402/Q000378;D001777;D001792/Q000378;D002118/Q000378;D016022;D003029/Q000378;D003094/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D005434;D006495/Q000097;D006495/Q000378;D006801;D015759/Q000494;D007476/Q000494;D010718/Q000378;D013577;D013917/Q000378;D013997	Adult;B-Lymphocytes/metabolism;Blood Coagulation;Blood Platelets/metabolism;Calcium/metabolism;Case-Control Studies;Coagulants/metabolism;Collagen/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Flow Cytometry;Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/blood;Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/metabolism;Humans;Ionomycin/pharmacology;Ionophores/pharmacology;Phosphatidylserines/metabolism;Syndrome;Thrombin/metabolism;Time Factors	Munnix IC;Harmsma M;Giddings JC;Collins PW;Feijge MA;Comfurius P;Heemskerk JW;Bevers EM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
670	12672655	Kinetic evidence that the Na-PO4 cotransporter is the molecular mechanism for Na/Li exchange in human red blood cells.	The molecular basis for Na/Li exchange is unknown. Li can be transported by the Na pump, anion exchanger (AE1), a background leak, and the Na/Li exchanger. In vivo the intraerythrocyte concentration of Li results from the balance of passive entry, mostly on AE1, and the active extrusion on the Na/Li exchanger. Here we show that erythrocytes have Li-activated PO4 transport that behaves as if it is mediated by the Na-PO4 cotransporter (hBNP1) and provide evidence that this Na/Li-PO4 cotransporter is also the mechanism for Na/Li exchange. First, external Li (>20 mM) activated PO4 influx severalfold. Li activation of PO4 influx was potentiated by the presence of external Na. Second, the ouabain-insensitive 22Na efflux was stimulated by external Li and then inhibited by external PO4. Third, phloretin inhibited Na- and Li-activated PO4 flux with the same Ki, 0.25 mM. Fourth, external PO4 (0.1-1.0 mM) inhibited ouabain-insensitive Li efflux only if external Na was present. Fifth, arsenate, a phosphate congener, inhibited both Na-PO4 cotransport and Li-activated PO4 flux with similar kinetics when Na or Li concentration was high but did not inhibit Liout/Nain exchange when Liout concentration was low. The collective results suggest that both Na and Li are substrates for at least two sites on the same PO4 cotransporter and that Na/Li exchange behaves as if it is mediated by this Na/Li-PO4 cotransporter when only one cation is bound. Plasma and intracellular PO4 concentrations may be important regulators of Li transport and its therapeutic effects.	eng	C446	C456	American journal of physiology.

671	14630365	Determination of thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in erythrocytes using 6-thioguanine as substrate and a non-extraction liquid chromatographic technique.	A non-extraction high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method has been developed for the determination of 6-methylthioguanine (6-MTG), as part of the determination of thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity (TPMT) in erythrocytes. Erythrocyte lysate is added to a glass vial containing substrates and incubation buffer, which is then sealed for the rest of the analysis. Enzyme incubation, sample preparation, and analysis are then undertaken without further sample-handling steps. The need for a solvent extraction step has been overcome by heating the incubate to 85 degrees C to stop the enzyme reaction. The heat inactivation step precipitates protein which upon centrifugation forms a thin film in the bottom of the glass vial enabling the supernatant to be injected directly onto the HPLC system. The assay shows excellent precision and recovery with a within-batch imprecision giving a co-efficient of variation of 2.9% (mean=41.5 nmol 6-MTG/gHb/h, n=10) and 5.1% (mean=12.6 nmol 6-MTG/g Hb/h, n=10). The between-batch imprecision gives a co-efficient of variation of 8.2% (mean=11.1 nmol 6-MTG/gHb/h, n=11) and 7.3% (mean=41.0 nmol 6-MTG/gHb/h, n=16). Determination of the TPMT activity in 120 people shows a range of enzyme activity of 11.3-63.8 nmol 6-MTG/gHb/h with a mean and median activity of 34.8 and 34.2 nmol 6-MTG/gHb/h, respectively. TPMT is increasingly used in clinical practice to ensure optimisation of treatment with thioguanine drugs. This direct HPLC method minimises sample-handling, reduces inherent imprecision, the possibility of laboratory error and with the potential for further automation, makes it ideal for use in a regional referral laboratory.	eng	111	115	Journal of chromatography.

672	14522954	Human pyridoxal phosphatase. Molecular cloning, functional expression, and tissue distribution.	Pyridoxal phosphatase catalyzes the dephosphorylation of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxine 5'-phosphate. A human brain cDNA clone was identified to the PLP phosphatase on the basis of peptide sequences obtained previously. The cDNA predicts a 296-amino acid protein with a calculated Mr of 31698. The open reading frame is encoded by two exons located on human chromosome 22q12.3, and the exon-intron junction contains the GT/AG consensus splice site. In addition, a full-length mouse PLP phosphatase cDNA of 1978 bp was also isolated. Mouse enzyme encodes a protein of 292 amino acids with Mr of 31512, and it is localized on chromosome 15.E1. Human and mouse PLP phosphatase share 93% identity in protein sequence. A BLAST search revealed the existence of putative proteins in organism ranging from bacteria to mammals. Catalytically active human PLP phosphatase was expressed in Escherichia coli, and characteristics of the recombinant enzyme were similar to those of erythrocyte enzyme. The recombinant enzyme displayed Km and kcat values for pyridoxal of 2.5 microM and 1.52 s(-1), respectively. Human PLP phosphatase mRNA is differentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner. A single mRNA transcript of 2.1 kb was detected in all human tissues examined and was highly abundant in the brain. Obtaining the molecular properties for the human PLP phosphatase may provide new direction for investigating metabolic pathway involving vitamin B6.	eng	50040	50046	The Journal of biological chemistry	278	50	2003	Dec	12	D000595;D000818;D001483;D001921/Q000378;D002884;D003001;D018076/Q000378;D019992;D004591;D004926/Q000378;D005091;D006801;D007438;D007700;D051379;D008957;D008969;D016366;D010455/Q000737;D010744/Q000096;D010744/Q000737;D010744/Q000235;D012333/Q000378;D011994/Q000737;D017386;D014018;D025101/Q000378	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Base Sequence;Brain/metabolism;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15;Cloning, Molecular;DNA, Complementary/metabolism;Databases as Topic;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Escherichia coli/metabolism;Exons;Humans;Introns;Kinetics;Mice;Models, Genetic;Molecular Sequence Data;Open Reading Frames;Peptides/chemistry;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/biosynthesis;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/chemistry;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins/chemistry;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Tissue Distribution;Vitamin B 6/metabolism	Jang YM;Kim DW;Kang TC;Won MH;Baek NI;Moon BJ;Choi SY;Kwon OS	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
673	12835614	Histamine N-methyltransferase gene polymorphisms in Chinese and their relationship with enzyme activity in erythrocytes.	The aim of this study was to identify polymorphisms in the histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) gene in Chinese and to assess their relationship with HNMT activity. One hundred and ninety-two unrelated subjects were recruited. HNMT polymorphisms were screened by direct sequencing with purified polymerase chain reaction products comprising all six exons, plus splice junctions, as well as approximately 2 kb of the 5'-flanking region (5'-FR). Erythrocyte HNMT activity was previously measured by radiochemical microassay. A total of 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, among which six SNPs had variant allele frequencies greater than 5%. Of the six common SNPs, three (-1637T>C, -463T>C and -411C>T) were located in 5'-FR, one (314C>T) in coding exons, and two (939A>G and 1097A>T) in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Most of these common SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium. Genotype-phenotype correlation analyses were performed for those common SNPs in 5'-FR and 3'-UTR. In males, no significant association was found between HNMT activity and these non-coding SNPs. However, in females, the -1637T>C or -463T>C tended to be associated with decreased HNMT activity, whereas the 939A>G or 1097A>T appeared to be correlated with increased enzymatic activity. HNMT polymorphisms differ considerably between Chinese and American. The common SNPs in 5'-FR (-1637T>C and -463T>C) and 3'-UTR (939A>G and 1097A>T) might conditionally regulate the activity of HNMT, or might be genetically linked to unknown mutation(s) underlying the HNMT phenotypic variance.	eng	389	397	Pharmacogenetics	13	7	2003	Jul		D020413;D024506;D000293;D000328;D000483;D044466/Q000235;D002681;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D005787;D005820;D014644;D006239;D006637/Q000235;D006637/Q000378;D006801;D015810;D008297;D011110;D012150;D020641;D012737;D044465/Q000235	3' Untranslated Regions;5' Flanking Region;Adolescent;Adult;Alleles;Asian People/genetics;China;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Gene Frequency;Genetic Testing;Genetic Variation;Haplotypes;Histamine N-Methyltransferase/genetics;Histamine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism;Humans;Linkage Disequilibrium;Male;Polymorphism, Genetic;Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Sex Factors;White People/genetics	Chen GL;Wang H;Wang W;Xu ZH;Zhou G;He F;Zhou HH	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
674	12765964	Alternative splicing of NHE-1 mediates Na-Li countertransport and associates with activity rate.	Sodium-lithium countertransport (SLC) is an ouabain-insensitive exchange of Na for Li found in the erythrocyte membrane of several mammalian species. Although increased SLC activity is presently the most consistent intermediate phenotype of essential hypertension and diabetic nephropathy in humans, the gene responsible for this membrane transport has not been identified. Because of functional similarities, SLC was suggested to represent an in vitro mode of operation of the Na-H exchanger (NHE). This hypothesis, however, has been long hampered by the total insensitivity of SLC to amiloride, which is an intrinsic inhibitor of the first isoform of NHE, the only NHE isoform detected in human erythrocytes. We describe here the identification in human reticulocytes and erythrocytes of an alternative splicing of NHE lacking the amiloride binding site. Transfection experiments with this spliced variant restore amiloride-insensitive, phloretin-sensitive SLC activity. Expression of both regular and spliced transcripts of NHE is increased in subjects with high SLC activity. Altogether, these findings, by extending to NHE the characteristics of inheritance and predictivity previously attributed to SLC, eventually restore the candidacy of NHE isoform 1 as a gene involved in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension and diabetic nephropathy.	eng	1511	1518	Diabetes	52	6	2003	Jun		D017398/Q000235;D000595;D017920/Q000097;D001483;D003001;D017931;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008094/Q000097;D008958;D008969;D010693/Q000494;D017433;D011994/Q000737;D011994/Q000378;D012156/Q000378;D020133;D016415;D012689;D012964/Q000097;D017923/Q000737;D017923/Q000235;D017923/Q000378;D014158	Alternative Splicing/genetics;Amino Acid Sequence;Antiporters/blood;Base Sequence;Cloning, Molecular;DNA Primers;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Lithium/blood;Models, Molecular;Molecular Sequence Data;Phloretin/pharmacology;Protein Structure, Secondary;Recombinant Proteins/chemistry;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Reticulocytes/metabolism;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid;Sodium/blood;Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/chemistry;Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/genetics;Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/metabolism;Transcription, Genetic	Zerbini G;Maestroni A;Breviario D;Mangili R;Casari G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
675	12773623	The hSK4 (KCNN4) isoform is the Ca2+-activated K+ channel (Gardos channel) in human red blood cells.	The question is, does the isoform hSK4, also designated KCNN4, represent the small conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ channel (Gardos channel) in human red blood cells? We have analyzed human reticulocyte RNA by RT-PCR, and, of the four isoforms of SK channels known, only SK4 was found. Northern blot analysis of purified and synchronously growing human erythroid progenitor cells, differentiating from erythroblasts to reticulocytes, again showed only the presence of SK4. Western blot analysis, with an anti-SK4 antibody, showed that human erythroid progenitor cells and, importantly, mature human red blood cell ghost membranes, both expressed the SK4 protein. The Gardos channel is known to turn on, given inside Ca2+, in the presence but not the absence of external Ko+ and remains refractory to Ko+ added after exposure to inside Ca2+. Heterologously expressed SK4, but not SK3, also shows this behavior. In inside-out patches of red cell membranes, the open probability (Po) of the Gardos channel is markedly reduced when the temperature is raised from 27 to 37 degrees C. Net K+ efflux of intact red cells is also reduced by increasing temperature, as are the Po values of inside-out patches of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing SK4 (but not SK3). Thus the envelope of evidence indicates that SK4 is the gene that codes for the Gardos channel in human red blood cells. This channel is important pathophysiologically, because it represents the major pathway for cell shrinkage via KCl and water loss that occurs in sickle cell disease.	eng	7366	7371	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	100	12	2003	Jun	10	D000595;D000755/Q000097;D000755/Q000235;D000818;D001483;D016466;D006224;D004247/Q000235;D004912/Q000378;D015672/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D051660;D007700;D008969;D015221/Q000097;D015221/Q000235;D015221/Q000378;D024681;D012313/Q000097;D012313/Q000235;D011994/Q000235;D011994/Q000378;D013696	Amino Acid Sequence;Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood;Anemia, Sickle Cell/genetics;Animals;Base Sequence;CHO Cells;Cricetinae;DNA/genetics;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Intermediate-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels;Kinetics;Molecular Sequence Data;Potassium Channels/blood;Potassium Channels/genetics;Potassium Channels/metabolism;Potassium Channels, Calcium-Activated;RNA/blood;RNA/genetics;Recombinant Proteins/genetics;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Temperature	Hoffman JF;Joiner W;Nehrke K;Potapova O;Foye K;Wickrema A	Journal, Articles							Erythro;Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;red cell	True
676	12628923	Protein kinase CK2 and protein kinase D are associated with the COP9 signalosome.	The COP9 signalosome (CSN) purified from human erythrocytes possesses kinase activity that phosphoryl ates proteins such as c-Jun and p53 with consequence for their ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent degradation. Here we show that protein kinase CK2 (CK2) and protein kinase D (PKD) co-purify with CSN. Immunoprecipitation and far-western blots reveal that CK2 and PKD are in fact associated with CSN. As indicated by electron microscopy with gold-labeled ATP, at least 10% of CSN particles are associated with kinases. Kinase activity, most likely due to CK2 and PKD, co-immuno precipitates with CSN from HeLa cells. CK2 binds to DeltaCSN3(111-403) and CSN7, whereas PKD interacts with full-length CSN3. CK2 phosphorylates CSN2 and CSN7, and PKD modifies CSN7. Both CK2 and PKD phosphorylate c-Jun as well as p53. CK2 phosphoryl ates Thr155, which targets p53 to degradation by the Ub system. Curcumin, emodin, DRB and resveratrol block CSN-associated kinases and induce degradation of c-Jun in HeLa cells. Curcumin treatment results in elevated amounts of c-Jun-Ub conjugates. We conclude that CK2 and PKD are recruited by CSN in order to regulate Ub conjugate formation.	eng	1302	1312	The EMBO journal	22	6	2003	Mar	17	D000255/Q000378;D000075686;D047390;D003474/Q000494;D004268;D004004/Q000494;D004642/Q000494;D004791/Q000494;D004912/Q000737;D006367;D006801;D046912;D010447;D010766;D011493/Q000037;D011493/Q000302;D011493/Q000378;D017346/Q000037;D017346/Q000302;D017346/Q000378;D021122;D011506/Q000737;D011506/Q000235;D011506/Q000378;D011506/Q000648;D016755/Q000235;D016755/Q000378;D011994/Q000737;D011994/Q000378;D000077185;D015398;D013267/Q000494;D013379;D016159/Q000235;D016159/Q000378;D014452/Q000378	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;COP9 Signalosome Complex;Casein Kinase II;Curcumin/pharmacology;DNA-Binding Proteins;Dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole/pharmacology;Emodin/pharmacology;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/chemistry;HeLa Cells;Humans;Multiprotein Complexes;Peptide Hydrolases;Phosphorylation;Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors;Protein Kinase C/isolation & purification;Protein Kinase C/metabolism;Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors;Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/isolation & purification;Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism;Protein Subunits;Proteins/chemistry;Proteins/genetics;Proteins/metabolism;Proteins/ultrastructure;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins/chemistry;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Resveratrol;Signal Transduction;Stilbenes/pharmacology;Substrate Specificity;Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics;Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism;Ubiquitins/metabolism	Uhle S;Medalia O;Waldron R;Dumdey R;Henklein P;Bech-Otschir D;Huang X;Berse M;Sperling J;Schade R;Dubiel W	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
677	12879156	The role of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) in transport of fluorescent anions across the human erythrocyte membrane.	We employed human red blood cells as a model system to check the affinity of MRP1 (Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein 1) towards fluorescein and a set of its carboxyl derivatives: 5/6-carboxyfluorescein (CF), 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5/6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) and calcein (CAL). We found significant differences in the characteristics of transport of the dyes tested across the erythrocyte membrane. Fluorescein is transported mainly in a passive way, while active efflux systems at least partially contribute to the transport of the other compounds. Inside-out vesicle studies revealed that active transport of calcein is masked by another, ATP-independent, transport activity. Inhibitor profiles of CF and BCECF transport are typical for substrates of organic anion transporters. BCECF is transported mainly via MRP1, as proven by the use of QCRL3, a monoclonal antibody known to specifically inhibit MRP1-mediated transport. Lack of effect of QCRL3 on CF uptake excludes the possibility of MRP1 being a transporter of this dye. No inhibition of CF accumulation by cGMP, thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine suggests also that this fluorescent marker is not a substrate for MRP5, another ABC transporter identified in the human erythrocyte membrane.	eng	79	90	The Journal of membrane biology	193	2	2003	May	15	D020168/Q000097;D000838;D004910/Q000378;D005452;D005456;D006801;D066298;D017136	ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/blood;Anions;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Fluoresceins;Fluorescent Dyes;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Ion Transport	Rychlik B;Balcerczyk A;Klimczak A;Bartosz G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
678	12888565	The blood group P1 synthase gene is identical to the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene. A clue to the solution of the P1/P2/p puzzle.	Blood group P1/P2 is a glycolipid antigen system for which the genetic mechanism has not yet been clarified. We analyzed the potential of the cloned Gb3/CD77 synthase to synthesize P1 antigen, because Gb3/CD77 and P1 share a common structure, Galalpha1,4Galbeta1,4Glc (NAc)-. L cell transfectants with Gb3/CD77 synthase cDNA expressed marginal levels of P1 on the cell surface but contained high levels of P1 in the cytoplasm. P2-type erythrocytes, which were serotyped as P2, also contained definite P1 antigen inside cells, although the amounts were lower than those of P1 cells. Only p erythrocytes lacked P1 antigen corresponding with function-losing mutations in the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene. Synthesis of P1 antigen from paragloboside in vitro was demonstrated using membrane fraction of the transfectants and a fusion enzyme with protein A. These results strongly suggested that P1 synthase is identical to Gb3/CD77 synthase and appear to propose a clue for the solution of the long-pending P1/P2/p puzzle. The P1/P2 difference might result from the difference in P1 quantity based on either different enzyme activity or the presence/absence of other enzyme modulators. Because P2 erythrocytes showed lower levels of Gb3/CD77 synthase mRNA than P1, 5'-upstream promoter regions were analyzed, resulting in the identification of two P2-specific homozygous mutations. Differences in the transcriptional regulation in erythrocytes might be a major factor determining P1/P2.	eng	44429	44438	The Journal of biological chemistry	278	45	2003	Nov	07	D000818;D000911;D001483;D001789/Q000096;D001789/Q000235;D002462/Q000201;D004912/Q000276;D005347;D005455;D005700/Q000096;D005700/Q000235;D015870;D005915/Q000096;D005915/Q000235;D005915/Q000378;D006801;D007075/Q000276;D007150;D007739;D051379;D008969;D009154;D011401/Q000235;D012333/Q000032;D051381;D011993;D020133;D017422;D013205/Q000235;D014162;D000519/Q000378	Animals;Antibodies, Monoclonal;Base Sequence;Blood Group Antigens/biosynthesis;Blood Group Antigens/genetics;Cell Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/immunology;Fibroblasts;Fluorescent Antibody Technique;Galactosyltransferases/biosynthesis;Galactosyltransferases/genetics;Gene Expression;Globosides/biosynthesis;Globosides/genetics;Globosides/metabolism;Humans;Immunoglobulin M/immunology;Immunohistochemistry;L Cells;Mice;Molecular Sequence Data;Mutation;Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics;RNA, Messenger/analysis;Rats;Recombinant Fusion Proteins;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Staphylococcal Protein A/genetics;Transfection;alpha-Galactosidase/metabolism	Iwamura K;Furukawa K;Uchikawa M;Sojka BN;Kojima Y;Wiels J;Shiku H;Urano T	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
679	12920120	Reaction of human hemoglobin with peroxynitrite. Isomerization to nitrate and secondary formation of protein radicals.	Peroxynitrite, a strong oxidant formed intravascularly in vivo, can diffuse onto erythrocytes and be largely consumed via a fast reaction (2 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1)) with oxyhemoglobin. The reaction mechanism of peroxynitrite with oxyhemoglobin that results in the formation of methemoglobin remains to be elucidated. In this work, we studied the reaction under biologically relevant conditions using millimolar oxyhemoglobin concentrations and a stoichiometric excess of oxyhemoglobin over peroxynitrite. The results support a reaction mechanism that involves the net one-electron oxidation of the ferrous heme, isomerization of peroxynitrite to nitrate, and production of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide. Homolytic cleavage of peroxynitrite within the heme iron allows the formation of ferrylhemoglobin in approximately 10% yields, which can decay to methemoglobin at the expense of reducing equivalents of the globin moiety. Indeed, spin-trapping studies using 2-methyl-2-nitroso propane and 5,5 dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) demonstrated the formation of tyrosyl- and cysteinyl-derived radicals. DMPO also inhibited covalently linked dimerization products and led to the formation of DMPO-hemoglobin adducts. Hemoglobin nitration was not observed unless an excess of peroxynitrite over oxyhemoglobin was used, in agreement with a marginal formation of nitrogen dioxide. The results obtained support a role of oxyhemoglobin as a relevant intravascular sink of peroxynitrite.	eng	44049	44057	The Journal of biological chemistry	278	45	2003	Nov	07	D015153;D003497/Q000737;D019281;D004578;D004591;D005914/Q000737;D006801;D006861/Q000737;D007150;D007501/Q000737;D007536;D008706/Q000737;D009566/Q000032;D009566/Q000737;D009573/Q000032;D010100/Q000032;D010108/Q000737;D030421/Q000737;D013053;D013113;D013481/Q000737;D014443/Q000031;D014443/Q000032	Blotting, Western;Cyclic N-Oxides/chemistry;Dimerization;Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Globins/chemistry;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry;Immunohistochemistry;Iron/chemistry;Isomerism;Methemoglobin/chemistry;Nitrates/analysis;Nitrates/chemistry;Nitrites/analysis;Oxygen/analysis;Oxyhemoglobins/chemistry;Peroxynitrous Acid/chemistry;Spectrophotometry;Spin Labels;Superoxides/chemistry;Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives;Tyrosine/analysis	Romero N;Radi R;Linares E;Augusto O;Detweiler CD;Mason RP;Denicola A	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
680	14577607	Metabolism, not autoxidation, plays a role in alpha-oxoaldehyde- and reducing sugar-induced erythrocyte GSH depletion: relevance for diabetes mellitus.	Erythrocyte and lens reduced glutathione (GSH) levels are often lower in patients with diabetes whereas erythrocyte dicarbonyl levels are often higher. We hypothesise that high plasma carbohydrates may be metabolised by glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways to form alpha-oxoaldehydes, which deplete cellular GSH. Our aims were: (1) to compare the effectiveness of various carbohydrates or metabolites at depleting erythrocyte GSH, (2) to determine if GSH loss is related to the autoxidation or metabolism of carbohydrates. It was found that erythrocyte GSH was depleted by 50% (ED-50) at t = 2.5 h when erythrocytes were incubated with the following: methylglyoxal (MG) 23 microM, glyoxal 75 microM, DL-glyceraldehyde 299 microM, deoxyribose 606 microM, xylitol 626 microM, and ribose 2 mM. The glycolytic inhibitors, sodium arsenate and KF prevented ribose, deoxyribose, xylitol and MG-induced GSH depletion in erythrocytes over 2 h. However, the antioxidant trolox and the ferric chelator detapac did not affect MG-induced GSH depletion. These data suggest that the carbohydrates or glyceraldehyde were metabolised to form carbonyls such as MG which depleted erythrocyte GSH as a result of catalysis by glyoxalase I. None of the carbohydrates were autoxidised to carbonyls over this time period. We speculate that as a result of GSH depletion, subsequent glycoxidative stress affects erythrocyte function and contributes to diabetic complications.	eng	331	338	Molecular and cellular biochemistry	252	1-2	2003	Oct		D000447/Q000378;D050260;D004912/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D005978/Q000097;D006019/Q000187;D006801;D019344/Q000097;D010084	Aldehydes/metabolism;Carbohydrate Metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Glutathione/blood;Glycolysis/drug effects;Humans;Lactic Acid/blood;Oxidation-Reduction	Beard KM;Shangari N;Wu B;O'Brien PJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
681	14580160	Characteristics of prolidase from the erythrocytes of normal humans and patients with prolidase deficiency and their mother.	Prolidases I and II were highly purified from human erythrocytes. The effects of various amino acids, MnCl2 and mercaptoethanol, on these two enzymes were investigated. Normal prolidase II was very labile in the absence of MnCl2 or mercaptoethanol. The activity of prolidase II was maintained at about 76% by pre-incubation with MnCl2; it was then activated up to 140% by treatment with mercaptoethanol for 60 minutes at 37 degrees C. Normal prolidases I and II showed the highest activity against glycylproline or methionylproline in the presence of MnCl2. The activity of prolidase I against glycylproline was enhanced strongly by glycine and MnCl2, but not activated in the absence of MnCl2. The activity of prolidase II against methionylproline was enhanced three-fold in the presence of glycine and MnCl2, but its activity against glycylproline was very low even in the presence of MnCl2. A stronger enhancement of this activity was found in normal erythrocytes, and a lower level of this activity was found in erythrocytes of patients treated with glycine, MnCl2 and mercaptoethanol compared to those treated with glycine and MnCl2. The activity of prolidase II against methionylproline in all erythrocytes, of normal humans and of patients, was strongly activated by the addition of glycine with MnCl2 but suppressed by the addition of mercaptoethanol.	eng	1323	1328	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	41	10	2003	Oct		D002712/Q000737;D002852;D004150/Q000097;D004150/Q000172;D004795;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D017895/Q000737;D008623/Q000737	Chlorides/chemistry;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Dipeptidases/blood;Dipeptidases/deficiency;Enzyme Stability;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Manganese Compounds/chemistry;Mercaptoethanol/chemistry	Nakayama K;Awata S;Zhang J;Kaba H;Manabe M;Kodama H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
682	14559119	Increased formation of methylglyoxal and protein glycation, oxidation and nitrosation in triosephosphate isomerase deficiency.	Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency is associated with the accumulation of dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) to abnormally high levels, congenital haemolytic anaemia and a clinical syndrome of progressive neuromuscular degeneration leading to infant mortality. DHAP degrades spontaneously to methylglyoxal (MG)--a potent precursor of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). MG is detoxified to D-lactate intracellularly by the glyoxalase system. We investigated the changes in MG metabolism and markers of protein glycation, oxidation and nitrosation in a Hungarian family with two germline identical brothers, compound heterozygotes for triosephosphate isomerase deficiency, one with clinical manifestations of chronic neurodegeneration and the other neurologically intact. The concentration of MG and activity of glyoxalase I in red blood cells (RBCs) were increased, and the concentrations of D-lactate in blood plasma and D-lactate urinary excretion were also increased markedly in the propositus. There were concomitant increases in MG-derived AGEs and the oxidative marker dityrosine in hemoglobin. Smaller and nonsignificant increases were found in the neurologically unaffected brother and parents. There was a marked increase (15-fold) in urinary excretion of the nitrosative stress marker 3-nitrotyrosine in the propositus. The increased derangement of MG metabolism and associated glycation, oxidative and nitrosative stress in the propositus may be linked to neurodegenerative process in triosephosphate isomerase deficiency.	eng	121	132	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1639	2	2003	Oct	15	D004912/Q000201;D006031;D006801;D007791/Q000378;D009566/Q000378;D015538;D010084;D011506/Q000378;D011765/Q000378;D013869/Q000378;D014305/Q000172;D014305/Q000378	Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glycosylation;Humans;Lactoylglutathione Lyase/metabolism;Nitrates/metabolism;Nitrosation;Oxidation-Reduction;Proteins/metabolism;Pyruvaldehyde/metabolism;Thiolester Hydrolases/metabolism;Triose-Phosphate Isomerase/deficiency;Triose-Phosphate Isomerase/metabolism	Ahmed N;Battah S;Karachalias N;Babaei-Jadidi R;Horányi M;Baróti K;Hollan S;Thornalley PJ	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
683	15630208	Formation of N-(hexanoyl)ethanolamine, a novel phosphatidylethanolamine adduct, during the oxidation of erythrocyte membrane and low-density lipoprotein.	The primary amino groups of biomolecules such as aminophospholipids, as well as proteins, are the potential targets of covalent modifications by lipid peroxidation products; however, little attention has been paid to the modification of aminophospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The purpose of this study is to characterize the formation of a novel modified phospholipid, N-(hexanoyl)phosphatidylethanolamine (HEPE), in the reaction of PE with lipid hydroperoxides using mass spectrometric analyses. Upon reaction of egg PE with 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid or other oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids followed by phospholipase D-mediated hydrolysis, the formation of N-(hexanoyl)ethanolamine (HEEA), a head group of HEPE, was confirmed by isotope dilution liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Moreover, increasing HEEA was detected in the hydrolysates of oxidized erythrocyte ghosts and low-density lipoprotein with their increasing lipid peroxidation levels. Collectively, these results suggest that the N-hexanoylated product of phospholipid, HEPE, can be generated during lipid peroxidation and may serve as one mechanism for the covalent modification of aminophospholipids in vivo.	eng	263	266	BioFactors (Oxford, England)	21	1-4	2004			D004910/Q000378;D004983/Q000737;D006801;D008054;D008077/Q000097;D009682;D013058;D008563/Q000097;D010084;D010714/Q000737	Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Ethanolamines/chemistry;Humans;Lipid Peroxides;Lipoproteins, LDL/blood;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Mass Spectrometry;Membrane Lipids/blood;Oxidation-Reduction;Phosphatidylethanolamines/chemistry	Tsuji K;Kawai Y;Kato Y;Osawa T	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
684	14752116	Human erythrocyte recycling of ascorbic acid: relative contributions from the ascorbate free radical and dehydroascorbic acid.	Recycling of ascorbic acid from its oxidized forms helps to maintain the vitamin in human erythrocytes. To determine the relative contributions of recycling from the ascorbate radical and dehydroascorbic acid, we studied erythrocytes exposed to a trans-membrane oxidant stress from ferricyanide. Ferricyanide was used both to induce oxidant stress across the cell membrane and to quantify ascorbate recycling. Erythrocytes reduced ferricyanide with generation of intracellular ascorbate radical, the concentrations of which saturated with increasing intracellular ascorbate and which were sustained over time in cells incubated with glucose. Ferricyanide also generated dehydroascorbic acid that accumulated in the cells and incubation medium to concentrations much higher than those of the radical, especially in the absence of glucose. Ferricyanide-stimulated ascorbate recycling from dehydroascorbic acid depended on intracellular GSH but was well maintained at the expense of intracellular ascorbate when GSH was severely depleted by diethylmaleate. This likely reflects continued radical reduction, which is not dependent on GSH. Erythrocyte hemolysates showed both NAD- and NADPH-dependent ascorbate radical reduction. The latter was partially due to thioredoxin reductase. GSH-dependent dehydroascorbate reduction in hemolysates, which was both direct and enzyme-dependent, was greater than that of the radical reductase activity but of lower apparent affinity. Together, these results suggest an efficient two-tiered system in which high affinity reduction of the ascorbate radical is sufficient to remove low concentrations of the radical that might be encountered by cells not under oxidant stress, with back-up by a high capacity system for reducing dehydroascorbate under conditions of more severe oxidant stress.	eng	14975	14982	The Journal of biological chemistry	279	15	2004	Apr	09	D001205/Q000378;D002462/Q000378;D003683/Q000378;D004305;D004912/Q000378;D005292/Q000494;D005609;D005947/Q000378;D005978/Q000378;D006801;D008298/Q000494;D008954;D009243/Q000378;D009249/Q000378;D016877/Q000378;D010100/Q000378;D013312;D013997	Ascorbic Acid/metabolism;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Dehydroascorbic Acid/metabolism;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Ferricyanides/pharmacology;Free Radicals;Glucose/metabolism;Glutathione/metabolism;Humans;Maleates/pharmacology;Models, Biological;NAD/metabolism;NADP/metabolism;Oxidants/metabolism;Oxygen/metabolism;Stress, Physiological;Time Factors	May JM;Qu ZC;Cobb CE	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
685	15078100	Kinetic mechanism of quinone oxidoreductase 2 and its inhibition by the antimalarial quinolines.	Quinone oxidoreductase 2 (QR2) purified from human red blood cells was recently shown to be a potential target of the quinoline antimalarial compounds [Graves et al., (2002) Mol. Pharmacol. 62, 1364]. QR2 catalyzes the two-electron reduction of menadione via the oxidation of N-alkylated or N-ribosylated nicotinamides. To investigate the mechanism and consequences of inhibition of QR2 by the quinolines further, we have used steady-state and transient-state kinetics to define the mechanism of QR2. Importantly, we have shown that QR2 when isolated from an overproducing strain of E. coli is kinetically equivalent to the enzyme from the native human red blood cell source. We observe ping-pong kinetics consistent with one substrate/inhibitor binding site that shows selectivity for the oxidation state of the FAD cofactor, suggesting that selective inhibition of the liver versus red blood cell forms of malaria may be possible. The reductant N-methyldihydronicotinamide and the inhibitor primaquine bind exclusively to the oxidized enzyme. In contrast, the inhibitors quinacrine and chloroquine bind exclusively to the reduced enzyme. The quinone substrate menadione, on the other hand, binds nonspecifically to both forms of the enzyme. Single-turnover kinetics of the reductive half-reaction are chemically and kinetically competent and confirm the inhibitor selectivity seen in the steady-state experiments. Our studies shed light on the possible in vivo potency of the quinolines and provide a foundation for future studies aimed at creating more potent QR2 inhibitors and at understanding the physiological significance of QR2.	eng	4538	4547	Biochemistry	43	15	2004	Apr	20	D000962/Q000494;D001667;D002738/Q000494;D003300/Q000032;D006801;D007700;D009536/Q000031;D009536/Q000737;D010084;D011319/Q000494;D011796/Q000494;D011804/Q000494;D011808/Q000037;D011808/Q000737;D011808/Q000302;D011994/Q000037;D011994/Q000737;D011994/Q000302;D013053;D013379;D015032/Q000032	Antimalarials/pharmacology;Binding, Competitive;Chloroquine/pharmacology;Copper/analysis;Humans;Kinetics;Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives;Niacinamide/chemistry;Oxidation-Reduction;Primaquine/pharmacology;Quinacrine/pharmacology;Quinolines/pharmacology;Quinone Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors;Quinone Reductases/chemistry;Quinone Reductases/isolation & purification;Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors;Recombinant Proteins/chemistry;Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification;Spectrophotometry;Substrate Specificity;Zinc/analysis	Kwiek JJ;Haystead TA;Rudolph J	Journal, Articles							red blood cell	True
686	15137908	Fructosamine 3-kinase-related protein and deglycation in human erythrocytes.	Fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K), an enzyme initially identified in erythrocytes, catalyses the phosphorylation of fructosamines on their third carbon, leading to their destabilization and their removal from protein. We show that human erythrocytes also contain FN3K-related protein (FN3K-RP), an enzyme that phosphorylates psicosamines and ribulosamines, but not fructosamines, on the third carbon of their sugar moiety. Protein-bound psicosamine 3-phosphates and ribulosamine 3-phosphates are unstable, decomposing at pH 7.1 and 37 degrees C with half-lives of 8.8 h and 25 min respectively, as compared with 7 h for fructosamine 3-phosphates. NMR analysis indicated that 1-deoxy-1-morpholinopsicose (DMP, a substrate for FN3K and FN3K-RP), like 1-deoxy-1-morpholinofructose (DMF, a substrate of FN3K), penetrated erythrocytes and was converted into the corresponding 3-phospho-derivative. Incubation of erythrocytes with 50 mM allose, 200 mM glucose or 10 mM ribose for 24 h resulted in the accumulation of glycated haemoglobin, and this accumulation was approx. 1.9-2.6-fold higher if DMP, a competitive inhibitor of both FN3K and FN3K-RP, was present in the incubation medium. Incubation with 50 mM allose or 200 mM glucose also caused the accumulation of ketoamine 3-phosphates, which was inhibited by DMP. By contrast, DMF, a specific inhibitor of FN3K, only affected the glucose-dependent accumulation of glycated haemoglobin and ketoamine 3-phosphates. These data indicate that FN3K-RP can phosphorylate intracellular, protein-bound psicosamines and ribulosamines, thus leading to deglycation.	eng	137	143	The Biochemical journal	382	Pt 1	2004	Aug	15	D000588/Q000737;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000201;D005632/Q000031;D005632/Q000737;D005947/Q000378;D006442/Q000737;D006801;D007649/Q000737;D009025/Q000737;D010710/Q000737;D010766;D017853/Q000378;D013379	Amines/chemistry;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Fructose/analogs & derivatives;Fructose/chemistry;Glucose/metabolism;Glycated Hemoglobin/chemistry;Humans;Ketamine/chemistry;Morpholines/chemistry;Phosphates/chemistry;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Collard F;Wiame E;Bergans N;Fortpied J;Vertommen D;Vanstapel F;Delpierre G;Van Schaftingen E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
687	15292511	Tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channels and muscarinic and purinergic receptors identified in human erythroid progenitor cells and red blood cell ghosts.	This article concerns the identification of different types of voltage-gated Na(+) channels and of muscarinic and purinergic receptors that are expressed in human erythroid precursor cells and red cell ghosts. We analyzed, by RT-PCR, RNA that was extracted from purified and synchronously growing human erythroid progenitor cells, differentiating from erythroblasts to reticulocytes in 7 to 14 days. These extracts were free of white cell and platelet contamination. Two types of voltage-gated, tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na(+) channels were found. These were Na(v)1.4 and Na(v)1.7, the former known to be present in skeletal muscle and the latter in peripheral nerve. By using a pan Na(+) channel antibody and Western blotting, an immunoreactive channel was detected in ghosts of human red blood cells, consistent with the expression of these two channels. The transcripts for four of the five known subtypes of muscarinic receptors were also identified, including subtypes M2, M3, M4, and M5, whereas subtype M1 was not found. Expression was also detected for the purinergic type receptors P2X(1), P2X(4), P2X(7), and P2Y(1) whereas types P2Y(2), P2Y(4), and P2Y(6) were not found. We also searched for but did not find transcripts for hBNP-1, a type 1b human brain sodium phosphate cotransporter, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Implications regarding the presence of these different types of channels and receptors in human red blood cells and their functional significance are discussed.	eng	12370	12374	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	101	33	2004	Aug	17	D001483;D017931/Q000235;D004910/Q000145;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D015672/Q000187;D015672/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D011976/Q000145;D011976/Q000187;D011976/Q000235;D011976/Q000378;D011983/Q000145;D011983/Q000187;D011983/Q000235;D011983/Q000378;D020133;D015222/Q000145;D015222/Q000187;D015222/Q000235;D015222/Q000378;D013779/Q000494	Base Sequence;DNA Primers/genetics;Erythrocyte Membrane/classification;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects;Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Receptors, Muscarinic/classification;Receptors, Muscarinic/drug effects;Receptors, Muscarinic/genetics;Receptors, Muscarinic/metabolism;Receptors, Purinergic/classification;Receptors, Purinergic/drug effects;Receptors, Purinergic/genetics;Receptors, Purinergic/metabolism;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Sodium Channels/classification;Sodium Channels/drug effects;Sodium Channels/genetics;Sodium Channels/metabolism;Tetrodotoxin/pharmacology	Hoffman JF;Dodson A;Wickrema A;Dib-Hajj SD	Journal, Articles							Erythro;Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;red cell	True
688	15294349	Phenol and catechol induce prehemolytic and hemolytic changes in human erythrocytes.	The toxic potency of two industrially used compounds (phenol and catechol) was studied in human blood cells in vitro. Catechol was found to be a more harmful toxin than phenol, since it provokes statistically significant changes in the function of erythrocytes even at low doses. Most of the changes was statistically significant for the doses of 50 ppm of catechol and 250 ppm of phenol. Both compounds induced methaemoglobin formation, glutathione depletion and conversion of oxyhaemoglobin to methaemoglobin, which is associated with superoxide anion production and lead to formation of ferryl hemoglobin, hydrogen peroxide or hydroxyl radicals. It is known that oxidation of catechol leads to formation of semiquinone radicals. Semiquinones are able to bind to nucleophilic residues like -SH or -NH2 of proteins and these macromolecules may undergo inactivation. We observed among especially susceptible to action of catechol are catalase (CAT) (100 ppm) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (250 ppm). Decrease of the activity of catalase and SOD by catechol induced radical species formation. This lead to inhibition of another protective enzymes such as glutathione-S-transferase (500 ppm), glutathione reductase (1000 ppm), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (1000 ppm). Cytotoxicity of phenol or catechol was noted as hemolysis. Haemoglobin liberated from erythrocytes in this process may further generate oxygen free radicals and subsequently initiate enzymes damage. It seems to be essential that in phenol and catechol toxicity special role play damages of heme proteins and other proteins molecule, and damages of lipids are not so important.	eng	73	84	Toxicology letters	152	1	2004	Aug	30	D016227/Q000032;D002374/Q000494;D002396/Q000633;D018929;D004202/Q000633;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000502;D005609;D005978/Q000378;D006454/Q000378;D006461/Q000187;D006801;D019800/Q000633;D013482/Q000494	Benzoquinones/analysis;Catalase/pharmacology;Catechols/toxicity;Cell Culture Techniques;Disinfectants/toxicity;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/physiology;Free Radicals;Glutathione/metabolism;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Hemolysis/drug effects;Humans;Phenol/toxicity;Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacology	Bukowska B;Kowalska S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
689	15548894	Heme degradation by reactive oxygen species.	Heme proteins play a major role in various biological functions, such as oxygen sensing, electron transport, signal transduction, and antioxidant defense enzymes. Most of these reactions are carried out by redox reactions of heme iron. As the heme is not recycled, most cells containing heme proteins have the microsomal mixed function oxygenase, heme oxygenase, which enzymatically degrades heme to biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and iron. However, the red cell with the largest pool of heme protein, hemoglobin, contains no heme oxygenase, and enzymatic degradation of the red cell heme occurs only after the senescent red cells are removed by the reticuloendothelial system. Therefore, only nonenzymatic heme degradation initiated when the heme iron undergoes redox reactions in the presence of oxygen-producing reactive oxygen species takes place in the red cell. Unlike enzymatic degradation, which specifically attacks the alpha-methene bridge, reactive oxygen species randomly attack all the carbon methene bridges of the tetrapyrrole rings, producing various pyrrole products in addition to releasing iron. This review focuses on the literature related to nonenzymatic heme degradation with special emphasis on hemoglobin, the dominant red cell heme protein.	eng	967	978	Antioxidants & redox signaling	6	6	2004	Dec		D000818;D000975/Q000737;D004730/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006418/Q000737;D006801;D006861/Q000737;D007501/Q000737;D008956;D010100/Q000378;D011524/Q000737;D017382	Animals;Antioxidants/chemistry;Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Heme/chemistry;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry;Iron/chemistry;Models, Chemical;Oxygen/metabolism;Protoporphyrins/chemistry;Reactive Oxygen Species	Nagababu E;Rifkind JM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True

691	15572441	Human Rhesus-associated glycoprotein mediates facilitated transport of NH(3) into red blood cells.	Rhesus (Rh) antigens are carried by a membrane complex that includes Rh proteins (D and CcEe), Rh-associated glycoproteins (RhAG), and accessory chains (LW and CD47) associated by noncovalent bonds. In heterologous expression systems, RhAG and its kidney orthologs function as ammonium transporters. In red blood cells (RBCs), it is generally accepted that NH(3) permeates by membrane lipid diffusion. We have revisited these issues by studying RBC and ghosts from human and mouse genetic variants with defects of proteins that comprise the Rh complex. In both normal and mutant cells, stopped-flow analyses of intracellular pH changes in the presence of inwardly directed methylammonium (CH(3)NH(+)(3)+CH(3)NH(2)) or ammonium (NH(+)(4)+NH(3)) gradients showed a rapid alkalinization phase. Cells from human and mouse variants exhibited a decrease in their kinetic rate constants that was strictly correlated to the degree of reduction of their RhAG/Rhag expression level. Rate constants were not affected by a reduction of Rh, CD47, or LW. CH(3)NH(2)/NH(3) transport was characterized by (i) a sensitivity to mercurials that is reversible by 2-mercaptoethanol and (ii) a reduction of alkalinization rate constants after bromelain digestion, which cleaves RhAG. The results show that RhAG facilitates CH(3)NH(2)/NH(3) movement across the RBC membrane and represents a potential example of a gas channel in mammalian cells. In RBCs, RhAG may transport NH(3) to detoxifying organs, like kidney and liver, and together with nonerythroid tissue orthologs may contribute to the regulation of the systemic acid-base balance.	eng	17222	17227	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	101	49	2004	Dec	07	D000136;D000641/Q000378;D000818;D001798/Q000235;D001798/Q000502;D002463;D004912/Q000378;D015870;D014644;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008562/Q000235;D008562/Q000502;D008744/Q000378;D051379	Acid-Base Equilibrium;Ammonia/metabolism;Animals;Blood Proteins/genetics;Blood Proteins/physiology;Cell Membrane Permeability;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Gene Expression;Genetic Variation;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics;Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology;Methylamines/metabolism;Mice	Ripoche P;Bertrand O;Gane P;Birkenmeier C;Colin Y;Cartron JP	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythro	True
692	15499831	NAD glycohydrolase activities and ADP-ribose uptake in erythrocytes from normal subjects and cancer patients.	Erythrocytes from cancer patients exhibited up to fivefold higher NAD glycohydrolase activities than control erythrocytes from normal subjects and also similarly increased [14C] ADP-ribose uptake values. When [adenosine-14C] NAD was used instead of free [14C] ADP-ribose, the uptake was dependent on ecto-NAD glycohydrolase activity. This was reflected in the inhibition of ADP-ribose uptake from [adenosine-14C] NAD by Cibacron Blue. ADP-ribose uptake in erythrocytes appeared to be complex: upon incubation with free [14C] ADP-ribose, the radiolabel associated with erythrocytes was located in nearly equal parts in cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Part of [14C] ADP-ribose binding to the membrane was covalent, as indicated by its resistance to trichloroacetic acid-treatment. A preincubation with unlabeled ADP-ribose depressed subsequent erythrocyte NAD glycohydrolase activity and binding of [14C] ADP-ribose to erythrocyte membrane; but it failed to inhibit the transfer of labeled ADP-ribose to erythrocyte cytoplasm. On the other hand, incubation with [adenosine-14C] NAD did not result in a similar covalent binding of radiolabel to erythrocyte membrane. In line with this finding, a preincubation with unlabeled NAD was not inhibitory on subsequent NAD glycohydrolase reaction and ADP-ribose binding. ADP-ribose binding and NAD glycohydrolase activities were found also in solubilized erythrocyte membrane proteins and, after size fractionation, mainly in a protein fraction of around 45kDa-molecular weight.	eng	41	53	Bioscience reports	24	1	2004	Feb		D036541/Q000097;D051997;D000246/Q000097;D000328;D000368;D015703/Q000097;D003593/Q000378;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D066298;D008297;D008562;D008875;D008970;D009244/Q000097;D009369/Q000097;D009369/Q000201	ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/blood;ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/blood;Adult;Aged;Antigens, CD/blood;Cytoplasm/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Male;Membrane Glycoproteins;Middle Aged;Molecular Weight;NAD+ Nucleosidase/blood;Neoplasms/blood;Neoplasms/enzymology	Albeniz I;Demir O;Nurten R;Bermek E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
693	14527338	Differential sorting of tyrosine kinases and phosphotyrosine phosphatases acting on band 3 during vesiculation of human erythrocytes.	One of the most intensively studied post-translational modifications of erythrocyte proteins is the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of band 3, which is strictly regulated in vivo by PTKs (protein-tyrosine kinases) and PTPs (protein-phosphotyrosine phosphatases). Two PTKs (p72(syk) and p56/53(lyn)) and two PTP activities (PTP1B and SHPTP-2) have been immunologically identified so far in mature human erythrocytes. We have shown previously that band 3 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon a decrease in cell volume, as occurs when erythrocytes treated with Ca(2+)/Ca(2+) ionophore (A23187) lose KCl and release microvesicles. Similar levels of band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation in vesicles and in the parent cells are induced by this treatment. However, we have found that tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3 in vesicles is more stable than in whole erythrocytes. Examination of how the identified PTPs and PTKs are partitioned between the vesicles and the remnant cells during vesiculation reveals that PTP1B, unlike the PTKs, is retained entirely in the parent cell compartment. Since a tight association between PTP1B and band 3 has been documented previously, we have investigated the partitioning of PTP1B and band 3 between the membrane and the membrane-skeletal fractions prepared from resting or Ca(2+)/A23187-treated cells. Our results rule out the possibility that the preferential retention of PTP1B within the cell was due to an increase in the amount of membrane-skeleton-associated band 3 (and of PTP1B) during the release of spectrin-free vesicles, suggesting a more complex modality of interaction of PTP1B with band 3 in the erythrocyte membrane. Analysis of erythrocytes of different cell ages revealed that PTP1B, unlike the other enzymes examined, was quantitatively conserved during erythrocyte aging. This suggests important roles for the down-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of band 3 in erythrocyte physiology, and for vesiculation as a mechanism of human erythrocyte senescence.	eng	489	497	The Biochemical journal	377	Pt 2	2004	Jan	15	D001457/Q000378;D000001/Q000494;D002462/Q000201;D016922;D022162/Q000201;D003599/Q000201;D004910/Q000201;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007476/Q000494;D010766;D021381;D054562;D017027/Q000032;D017027/Q000378;D011505/Q000032;D011505/Q000378;D014443/Q000378	Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Calcimycin/pharmacology;Cell Membrane/enzymology;Cellular Senescence;Cytoplasmic Vesicles/enzymology;Cytoskeleton/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Ionophores/pharmacology;Phosphorylation;Protein Transport;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/analysis;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism;Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis;Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism;Tyrosine/metabolism	Minetti G;Ciana A;Balduini C	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
694	15234337	Evaluation of pentitol metabolism in mammalian tissues provides new insight into disorders of human sugar metabolism.	To more completely elucidate the pathways of sugar metabolism in human, we have evaluated the formation and degradation of pentitols in human fibroblasts and erythrocytes. Cultured human fibroblasts were incubated with d-arabinose, d-ribose, d-ribulose, and d-xylulose. Formation of arabitol and ribitol was analyzed by gas chromatography of the incubation medium and cell homogenate. We found that the pentoses d-arabinose and d-ribose could cross cell membranes, which indicate possible pentitol formation from extracellular pentoses. Fibroblasts formed 17+/-4 nmol arabitol/4 days/mg protein from d-arabinose and ribitol production rates of 70+/-15 nmol/4 days/mg protein were found after d-ribose incubation. Following d-ribulose incubation 13 nmol ribitol/4 days/mg protein was found. Human cultured fibroblasts were also incubated with d-arabitol, ribitol, and xylitol. Analyzing the incubation medium and cell homogenate revealed an absence of pentose formation. However, export of the pentitols arabitol and ribitol across the cell membrane was demonstrated, indicating that pentitols can be cleared from the body without metabolic conversion. Finally, human erythrocytes were incubated with d-/l-arabitol, ribitol, sorbitol, and xylitol. Activities of potential pentitol dehydrogenases were evaluated by a fluorometric assay. No evidence for ribitol and arabitol degradation was observed in human erythrocytes, as compared to polyol dehydrogenase activities ranging from 1.3 to 6.1 pmol NADH/min/microl erythrocytes observed using sorbitol and xylitol. Our results indicate that ribitol and arabitol are metabolic end products in humans.	eng	231	237	Molecular genetics and metabolism	82	3	2004	Jul		D002462/Q000378;D002478;D002849;D004912/Q000378;D005347/Q000378;D005470;D006801;D010429/Q000378;D012255/Q000378;D013402/Q000378	Cell Membrane/metabolism;Cells, Cultured;Chromatography, Gas;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fibroblasts/metabolism;Fluorometry;Humans;Pentoses/metabolism;Ribitol/metabolism;Sugar Alcohols/metabolism	Huck JH;Roos B;Jakobs C;van der Knaap MS;Verhoeven NM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
695	15238149	Molecular basis of Japanese variants of pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase deficiency.	The type-I isoform of pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (P5N-I) has an important role in the catabolism of pyrimidine mononucleotides during erythroid maturation. Two alternatively spliced forms of P5N-I mRNA have been identified, and we found another alternatively spliced form in reticulocytes, which included an additional 87-bp sequence. The sequence is located 6.2-kb downstream of the exon 2 and 2.7-kb upstream of the exon 3 sequence; consequently, the P5N-I gene encodes 11 exons, which span approximately 48 kb. We identified five novel mutations in nine families with P5N-I deficiency: two missense mutations (425C, 721C), one splice mutation (339C), one 1-bp insertion (251-insA-252) and one 9-bp deletion (del 192-200). All patients were homozygous for each mutation. The mutant P5N-I with 721C (G241R) had lower affinity for cytidine monophosphate, suggesting that Gly241 is important for substrate binding. Haplotype analysis showed that 721C, which had been identified in five unrelated families, was a founder mutation. The mutant P5N was then expressed in Cos-7. The degradation of P5N with 425C (L142P) was significantly faster than a wild-type control, and proteasome inhibitors restored the stability of L142P. These data suggest that L142P increases susceptibility to the degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.	eng	265	271	British journal of haematology	126	2	2004	Jul		D015720/Q000172;D015720/Q000235;D000293;D000328;D017398;D000743/Q000201;D000818;D001483;D019556;D002648;D002675;D004252;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007564;D008297;D008875;D008969;D009154;D011742/Q000378	5'-Nucleotidase/deficiency;5'-Nucleotidase/genetics;Adolescent;Adult;Alternative Splicing;Anemia, Hemolytic/enzymology;Animals;Base Sequence;COS Cells;Child;Child, Preschool;DNA Mutational Analysis;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Japan;Male;Middle Aged;Molecular Sequence Data;Mutation;Pyrimidine Nucleotides/metabolism	Kanno H;Takizawa T;Miwa S;Fujii H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythro	True
696	15114530	AICA-ribosiduria: a novel, neurologically devastating inborn error of purine biosynthesis caused by mutation of ATIC.	"In a female infant with dysmorphic features, severe neurological defects, and congenital blindness, a positive urinary Bratton-Marshall test led to identification of a massive excretion of 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide (AICA)-riboside, the dephosphorylated counterpart of AICAR (also termed ""ZMP""), an intermediate of de novo purine biosynthesis. ZMP and its di- and triphosphate accumulated in the patient's erythrocytes. Incubation of her fibroblasts with AICA-riboside led to accumulation of AICAR, not observed in control cells, suggesting impairment of the final steps of purine biosynthesis, catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme AICAR transformylase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC). AICAR transformylase was profoundly deficient, whereas the IMP cyclohydrolase level was 40% of normal. Sequencing of ATIC showed a K426R change in the transformylase region in one allele and a frameshift in the other. Recombinant protein carrying mutation K426R completely lacks AICAR transformylase activity."	eng	1276	1281	American journal of human genetics	74	6	2004	Jun		D000620/Q000031;D000620/Q000378;D001766/Q000151;D002675;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D005347/Q000187;D006801;D019877/Q000172;D019877/Q000235;D008661/Q000235;D008969;D009154/Q000235;D009709/Q000235;D009709/Q000378;D051027;D011687/Q000096;D011994/Q000235;D011994/Q000302;D011994/Q000378;D012265/Q000378	Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/metabolism;Blindness/congenital;Child, Preschool;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Fibroblasts/drug effects;Humans;Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases/deficiency;Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases/genetics;Metabolism, Inborn Errors/genetics;Molecular Sequence Data;Mutation/genetics;Nucleotide Deaminases/genetics;Nucleotide Deaminases/metabolism;Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase;Purines/biosynthesis;Recombinant Proteins/genetics;Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Ribonucleotides/metabolism	Marie S;Heron B;Bitoun P;Timmerman T;Van Den Berghe G;Vincent MF	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
697	14976052	Human potassium chloride cotransporter 1 (SLC12A4) promoter is regulated by AP-2 and contains a functional downstream promoter element.	Most K-Cl cotransport in the erythrocyte is attributed to potassium chloride cotransporter 1 (KCC1). K-Cl cotransport is elevated in sickle erythrocytes, and the KCC1 gene has been proposed as a modifier gene in sickle cell disease. To provide insight into our understanding of the regulation of the human KCC1 gene, we mapped the 5' end of the KCC1 cDNA, cloned the corresponding genomic DNA, and identified the KCC1 gene promoter. The core promoter lacks a TATA box and is composed of an initiator element (InR) and a downstream promoter element (DPE), a combination found primarily in Drosophila gene promoters and rarely observed in mammalian gene promoters. Mutational analyses demonstrated that both the InR and DPE sites were critical for full promoter activity. In vitro DNase I footprinting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and reporter gene assays identified functional AP-2 and Sp1 sites in this region. The KCC1 promoter was transactivated by forced expression of AP-2 in heterologous cells. Sequences encoding the InR, DPE, AP-2, and Sp1 sites were 100% conserved between human and murine KCC1 genes. In vivo studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with antihistone H3 and antihistone H4 antibodies demonstrated hyperacetylation of this core promoter region.	eng	4302	4309	Blood	103	11	2004	Jun	01	D020121/Q000235;D000107;D001483;D006528;D002843;D003001;D004268/Q000378;D041905;D006367;D006801;D020014;D008969;D011233;D011401/Q000235;D016329/Q000378;D027981/Q000235;D027981/Q000378;D050656;D014157/Q000378;D024363;D000096922	5' Untranslated Regions/genetics;Acetylation;Base Sequence;Carcinoma, Hepatocellular;Chromatin;Cloning, Molecular;DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism;Erythroid Cells;HeLa Cells;Humans;K562 Cells;Molecular Sequence Data;Precipitin Tests;Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics;Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism;Symporters/genetics;Symporters/metabolism;Transcription Factor AP-2;Transcription Factors/metabolism;Transcription Initiation Site;K Cl- Cotransporters	Zhou GP;Wong C;Su R;Crable SC;Anderson KP;Gallagher PG	Journal, Articles							Erythro;erythrocyte	True
698	15095787	Band 3 is a target protein of spectrin's E2/E3 activity: implication for sickle cell disease and normal red blood cell aging.	We have demonstrated that a 125 kDa red blood cell (RBC) membrane protein, being a target of spectrin's E2/E3 activity, is ubiquitinated band 3. This demonstration was based on copurification of this biotinylated-ubiquitinated protein with band 3, immunoprecipitation with band 3 antibody and analysis of proteins associated with strepavidin sepharose by micro liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (microLC/MS/MS). Further, we demonstrated the presence of ubiquitinated band 3 in vivo by Western blotting of purified band 3 with a monoclonal antibody (FK2) against ubiquitin. The implications of these results for sickle cell disease and RBC aging are discussed.	eng	171	177	Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)	50	2	2004	Mar		D000755/Q000097;D000755/Q000378;D001457/Q000032;D001457/Q000378;D004591;D004905;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D013058/Q000379;D008970;D013049/Q000032;D013049/Q000378;D014452/Q000378	Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood;Anemia, Sickle Cell/metabolism;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/analysis;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Mass Spectrometry/methods;Molecular Weight;Spectrin/analysis;Spectrin/metabolism;Ubiquitins/metabolism	Chang TL;Cubillos FF;Kakhniashvili DG;Goodman SR	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
699	14963112	The human erythrocyte proteome: analysis by ion trap mass spectrometry.	"This report describes an analysis of the red blood cell proteome by ion trap tandem mass spectrometry in line with liquid chromatography. Mature red blood cells lack all internal cell structures and consist of cytoplasm within a plasma membrane envelope. To maximize outcome, total red blood cell protein was divided into two fractions of membrane-associated proteins and cytoplasmic proteins. Both fractions were divided into subfractions, and proteins were identified in each fraction separately through tryptic digestion. Membrane protein digests were collected from externally exposed proteins, internally exposed proteins, ""spectrin extract"" mainly consisting of membrane skeleton proteins, and membrane proteins minus spectrin extract. Cytoplasmic proteins were divided into 21 fractions based on molecular mass by size exclusion chromatography. The tryptic peptides were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by ion trap tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 181 unique protein sequences were identified: 91 in the membrane fractions and 91 in the cytoplasmic fractions. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was identified with high sequence coverage in both membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. Identified proteins include membrane skeletal proteins, metabolic enzymes, transporters and channel proteins, adhesion proteins, hemoglobins, cellular defense proteins, proteins of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, G-proteins of the Ras family, kinases, chaperone proteins, proteases, translation initiation factors, and others. In addition to the known proteins, there were 43 proteins whose identification was not determined."	eng	501	509	Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP	3	5	2004	May		D002458;D002851;D003593/Q000378;D030562;D004910/Q000378;D005987;D006801;D020543;D021241	Cell Fractionation;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cytoplasm/metabolism;Databases, Protein;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases;Humans;Proteome;Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization	Kakhniashvili DG;Bulla LA;Goodman SR	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
700	15039022	Phosphotyrosine phosphatases acting on band 3 in human erythrocytes of different age: PTP1B processing during cell ageing.	The phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of human red blood cell (RBC) band 3 is regulated in vivo by constitutively active tyrosine-kinases (PTKs) and phosphotyrosine-phosphatases (PTPs), identified so far as, respectively, p72(syk) and p56/53(lyn), and PTP1B and SHPTP-2. Tyr-phosphorylation of band 3 increases upon reduction of cell volume as in hypertonic media or during Ca(2+)-induced membrane vesiculation. We show here that old RBCs display higher Tyr-phosphorylation levels of band 3 than younger cells under hypertonic conditions, at least in part due to the reduced cell volume of old RBCs, a condition of lowered threshold for activation of volume-sensitive PTKs. We have also analysed the membrane-bound PTP activity and the relative abundance of PTP1B (as the main membrane-associated PTP) in RBCs of different age. Immunodetection of PTP1B in purified ghost membranes revealed that the catalytic, N-terminal domain of the PTP is partially cleaved, in an age-dependent manner, from the membrane-bound domain, and it is lost during the preparation of ghost membranes. This suggests that erythrocytes may undergo in vivo activation of the Ca(2+)-dependent calpain system that proteolytically regulates PTP1B activity, as already documented for other cell types. On the other hand, the assay of the PTP activity that remains associated with the membranes of RBCs of different age indicated that the PTP undergoes oxidative inactivation that can be further differentiated into reversible and irreversible components.	eng	169	173	Bioelectrochemistry (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	62	2	2004	May		D001457/Q000378;D002469/Q000379;D004229/Q000494;D004905;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000648;D006801;D006982/Q000494;D010084;D010766;D054562;D017027/Q000378	Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Cell Separation/methods;Dithiothreitol/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/ultrastructure;Humans;Hypertonic Solutions/pharmacology;Oxidation-Reduction;Phosphorylation;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism	Ciana A;Minetti G;Balduini C	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
701	14726390	Cytosolic phospholipase A2 type IVA is present in human red cells.	Phospholipase A(2) type IVA (IVAPLA(2)) is a cytosolic enzyme that on activation selectively releases arachidonic acid (AA) from cell membrane phospholipids. Both AA and lysophospholipid, products of the enzymic reaction, can function as signal transducers in cellular interactions. The enzyme is present in most cells, including polymorphs, eosinophils, and platelets. This study used affinity purification to extract IVAPLA(2) from red cell lysate prepared from leukocyte- and platelet-depleted human blood to overcome the masking effect of hemoglobin on Western blot detection. We show that IVAPLA(2) is present in red cells as a 90-kDa protein.	eng	3562	3564	Blood	103	9	2004	May	01	D015153;D002846;D003600/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D054513;D006801;D008970;D010741/Q000032;D010741/Q000302;D054467;D020298/Q000201	Blotting, Western;Chromatography, Affinity;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Group IV Phospholipases A2;Humans;Molecular Weight;Phospholipases A/analysis;Phospholipases A/isolation & purification;Phospholipases A2;U937 Cells/enzymology	Macdonald DJ;Boyle RM;Glen AC;Horrobin DF	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell	True

703	15272009	Plasmodium induces swelling-activated ClC-2 anion channels in the host erythrocyte.	Intraerythrocytic growth of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum depends on delivery of nutrients. Moreover, infection challenges cell volume constancy of the host erythrocyte requiring enhanced activity of cell volume regulatory mechanisms. Patch clamp recording demonstrated inwardly and outwardly rectifying anion channels in infected but not in control erythrocytes. The molecular identity of those channels remained elusive. We show here for one channel type that voltage dependence, cell volume sensitivity, and activation by oxidation are identical to ClC-2. Moreover, Western blots and FACS analysis showed protein and functional ClC-2 expression in human erythrocytes and erythrocytes from wild type (Clcn2(+/+)) but not from Clcn2(-/-) mice. Finally, patch clamp recording revealed activation of volume-sensitive inwardly rectifying channels in Plasmodium berghei-infected Clcn2(+/+) but not Clcn2(-/-) erythrocytes. Erythrocytes from infected mice of both genotypes differed in cell volume and inhibition of ClC-2 by ZnCl(2) (1 mm) induced an increase of cell volume only in parasitized Clcn2(+/+) erythrocytes. Lack of ClC-2 did not inhibit P. berghei development in vivo nor substantially affect the mortality of infected mice. In conclusion, activation of host ClC-2 channels participates in the altered permeability of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes but is not required for intraerythrocytic parasite survival.	eng	41444	41452	The Journal of biological chemistry	279	40	2004	Oct	01	D000818;D000090007;D002463;D048429;D018118/Q000096;D018118/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000469;D005786;D006801;D051379;D018345;D009995;D018408;D010962/Q000254;D010962/Q000502	Animals;CLC-2 Chloride Channels;Cell Membrane Permeability;Cell Size;Chloride Channels/biosynthesis;Chloride Channels/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Gene Expression Regulation;Humans;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Osmosis;Patch-Clamp Techniques;Plasmodium berghei/growth & development;Plasmodium berghei/physiology	Huber SM;Duranton C;Henke G;Van De Sand C;Heussler V;Shumilina E;Sandu CD;Tanneur V;Brand V;Kasinathan RS;Lang KS;Kremsner PG;Hübner CA;Rust MB;Dedek K;Jentsch TJ;Lang F	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
704	15449937	Crystal structures of HbA2 and HbE and modeling of hemoglobin delta 4: interpretation of the thermal stability and the antisickling effect of HbA2 and identification of the ferrocyanide binding site in Hb.	Hemoglobin A(2) (alpha(2)delta(2)) is an important hemoglobin variant which is a minor component (2-3%) in the circulating red blood cells, and its elevated concentration in beta-thalassemia is a useful clinical diagnostic. In beta-thalassemia major, where there is beta-chain production failure, HbA(2) acts as the predominant oxygen deliverer. HbA(2) has two more important features. (1) It is more resistant to thermal denaturation than HbA, and (2) it inhibits the polymerization of deoxy sickle hemoglobin (HbS). Hemoglobin E (E26K(beta)), formed as a result of the splice site mutation on exon 1 of the beta-globin gene, is another important hemoglobin variant which is known to be unstable at high temperatures. Both heterozygous HbE (HbAE) and homozygous HbE (HbEE) are benign disorders, but when HbE combines with beta-thalassemia, it causes E/beta-thalassemia which has severe clinical consequences. In this paper, we present the crystal structures of HbA(2) and HbE at 2.20 and 1.74 A resolution, respectively, in their R2 states, which have been used here to provide the probable explanations of the thermal stability and instability of HbA(2) and HbE. Using the coordinates of R2 state HbA(2), we modeled the structure of T state HbA(2) which allowed us to address the structural basis of the antisickling property of HbA(2). Using the coordinates of the delta-chain of HbA(2) (R2 state), we also modeled the structure of hemoglobin homotetramer delta(4) that occurs in the case of rare HbH disease. From the differences in intersubunit contacts among beta(4), gamma(4), and delta(4), we formed a hypothesis regarding the possible tetramerization pathway of delta(4). The crystal structure of a ferrocyanide-bound HbA(2) at 1.88 A resolution is also presented here, which throws light on the location and the mode of binding of ferrocyanide anion with hemoglobin, predominantly using the residues involved in DPG binding. The pH dependence of ferrocyanide binding with hemoglobin has also been investigated.	eng	12477	12488	Biochemistry	43	39	2004	Oct	05	D017398/Q000235;D000986/Q000737;D000986/Q000378;D001665;D003460;D018360;D005295/Q000378;D018698/Q000235;D006443/Q000737;D006443/Q000378;D006446/Q000737;D006446/Q000235;D006446/Q000378;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D008239/Q000235;D008706/Q000031;D008706/Q000737;D008958;D009154;D011489;D011499;D021122/Q000737;D021122/Q000378;D013816	Alternative Splicing/genetics;Antisickling Agents/chemistry;Antisickling Agents/metabolism;Binding Sites;Crystallization;Crystallography, X-Ray;Ferrocyanides/metabolism;Glutamic Acid/genetics;Hemoglobin A2/chemistry;Hemoglobin A2/metabolism;Hemoglobin E/chemistry;Hemoglobin E/genetics;Hemoglobin E/metabolism;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Lysine/genetics;Methemoglobin/analogs & derivatives;Methemoglobin/chemistry;Models, Molecular;Mutation;Protein Denaturation;Protein Processing, Post-Translational;Protein Subunits/chemistry;Protein Subunits/metabolism;Thermodynamics	Sen U;Dasgupta J;Choudhury D;Datta P;Chakrabarti A;Chakrabarty SB;Chakrabarty A;Dattagupta JK	Journal, Articles							red blood cell	True
705	15304508	Extracellular ATP increases cation fluxes in human erythrocytes by activation of the P2X7 receptor.	Canine erythrocytes are known to undergo a reversible increase in cation permeability when incubated with extracellular ATP. We have examined the expression and function of P2X receptors on human erythrocytes using confocal microscopy and a panel of anti-P2X(1-7) antibodies and have measured monovalent cation fluxes in the presence of various nucleotide agonists. Human erythrocytes expressed P2X7 receptors on all cells examined from eight of eight subjects, as well as P2X2 at a far lower staining intensity in six of eight subjects. ATP stimulated the efflux of 86Rb+ (K+) from human erythrocytes in a dose-dependent fashion with an EC50 of approximately 95 microM. Other nucleotides also induced an efflux of 86Rb+ from erythrocytes with an order of agonist potency of 2'- and 3'-O(4-benzoylbenzoyl) ATP (BzATP) > ATP > 2-methylthio-ATP (2MeSATP) > adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATPgammaS), whereas ADP or UTP had no effect. ATP-induced efflux of 86Rb+ from erythrocytes was inhibited by extracellular Na+ and oxidized ATP, as well as by KN-62, an antagonist specific for the human P2X7 receptor. When erythrocytes were incubated in isotonic KCl medium, the addition of ATP stimulated an 86Rb+ influx approximately equal in magnitude to ATP-stimulated 86Rb+ efflux from the same cells. BzATP also stimulated the influx of 22Na+ into erythrocytes incubated in isotonic NaCl medium. Both ATP-induced efflux and influx of 86Rb+ and 22Na+ were impaired in erythrocytes from subjects who had inherited loss-of-function polymorphisms in the P2X7 receptor. These results suggest that the reversible permeabilization of erythrocytes by extracellular ATP is mediated by the P2X7 receptor.	eng	44749	44755	The Journal of biological chemistry	279	43	2004	Oct	22	D019307/Q000031;D019307/Q000494;D000255/Q000737;D000255/Q000378;D000818;D002412;D002417;D004305;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007477;D018613;D008856;D018048/Q000378;D058486;D012413/Q000737;D012413/Q000378;D012964/Q000737;D013997;D014544/Q000378	1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/analogs & derivatives;1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/pharmacology;Adenosine Triphosphate/chemistry;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Animals;Cations;Cattle;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Ions;Microscopy, Confocal;Microscopy, Fluorescence;Receptors, Purinergic P2/metabolism;Receptors, Purinergic P2X7;Rubidium/chemistry;Rubidium/metabolism;Sodium/chemistry;Time Factors;Uridine Triphosphate/metabolism	Sluyter R;Shemon AN;Barden JA;Wiley JS	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
706	16309273	Effects of 5-fluorouracil on erythrocytes in relation to its cardiotoxicity: membrane structure and functioning.	In the present study, we showed that the antineoplastic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) induces in vitro exposure-time/dose-dependent changes on the level of an erythrocyte's morphology, ionic balance, and membrane fluidity. These changes are partially or fully irreversible, and we suggest that they are provoked by an irreversible depletion of ATP. Because of these changes that could also occur in vivo during 5-FU infusion, a certain amount of erythrocytes with echinocytic shape and diminished ability to deliver oxygen is present in blood for longer periods of time. This renders oxygen transport and delivery more difficult, leaving the heart with an insufficient supply of oxygen, thus leading to cardiotoxicity.	eng	1680	1685	Journal of chemical information and modeling	45	6	2005			D000964/Q000494;D000964/Q000633;D002851;D004734/Q000502;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000648;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000648;D005472/Q000494;D005472/Q000633;D006331/Q000139;D006461;D006801;D066298;D009682;D008560;D010101/Q000502;D011188/Q000097;D013113	Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology;Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/toxicity;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Energy Metabolism/physiology;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/ultrastructure;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/ultrastructure;Fluorouracil/pharmacology;Fluorouracil/toxicity;Heart Diseases/chemically induced;Hemolysis;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Membrane Fluidity;Oxygen Consumption/physiology;Potassium/blood;Spin Labels	Spasojević I;Maksimović V;Zakrzewska J;Bacić G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
707	16415502	Rabbit erythrocytes possess adenylyl cyclase type II that is activated by the heterotrimeric G proteins Gs and Gi.	Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release from rabbit erythrocytes occurs in response to deformation or reduced oxygen tension. A signal transduction pathway that relates these stimuli to ATP release has been proposed. This pathway includes the heterotrimeric G proteins, Gs and Gi, adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Importantly, adenylyl cyclase types II, IV and VII have been reported to be activated by both Gs and Gi. Here, we demonstrate that rabbit erythrocytes possess an adenylyl cyclase subtype that is activated both by the alpha subunit and the betagamma subunit of Gs and Gi, respectively. Washed rabbit erythrocytes released ATP when exposed to the beta adrenergic receptor-mediated activator of Gs, isoproterenol (ISO, 10 microM, n = 8, p < 0.05) as well as in response to incubation with a direct activator of Gi, mastoparan 7 (MAS7, 10 microM, n = 12, p < 0.05). In contrast, an inactive mastoparan derivative, mastoparan 17 (MAS 17, 10 microM, n = 6) did not stimulate ATP release. Importantly, incubation of washed rabbit erythrocytes with either isoprotenerol (ISO) (10 microM, n = 7) or MAS7 (10 microM, n = 11) resulted in increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (p < 0.01).Western analysis was used to determine if an adenylyl cyclase capable of being activated by both Gs and Gi was a component of rabbit erythrocyte membranes. We identified adenylyl cyclase type II with two antibodies generated against different epitopes of the protein. These results provide support for the hypothesis that, in rabbit erythrocytes, activation of either Gs or Gi results in the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase resulting in increases in cAMP leading, ultimately, to the release of ATP.	eng	222	228	Pharmacological reports : PR	57 Suppl		2005			D000255/Q000378;D000262/Q000378;D000818;D015153;D000242/Q000378;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D019206/Q000378;D019205/Q000378;D036341;D007545/Q000494;D008297;D010455/Q000494;D011817	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism;Animals;Blotting, Western;Cyclic AMP/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/metabolism;GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs/metabolism;Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins;Isoproterenol/pharmacology;Male;Peptides/pharmacology;Rabbits	Sprague R;Bowles E;Stumpf M;Ricketts G;Freidman A;Hou WH;Stephenson A;Lonigro A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
708	15795384	Discovery of the ergothioneine transporter.	Variants of the SLC22A4 gene are associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. SLC22A4 codes for an integral membrane protein, OCTN1, that has been presumed to carry organic cations like tetraethylammonium across the plasma membrane. Here, we show that the key substrate of this transporter is in fact ergothioneine (ET). Human OCTN1 was expressed in 293 cells. A substrate lead, stachydrine (alias proline betaine), was identified by liquid chromatography MS difference shading, a new substrate search strategy. Analysis of transport efficiency of stachydrine-related solutes, affinity, and Na+ dependence indicates that the physiological substrate is ET. Efficiency of transport of ET was as high as 195 microl per min per mg of protein. By contrast, the carnitine transporter OCTN2 from rat did not transport ET at all. Because ET is transported >100 times more efficiently than tetraethylammonium and carnitine, we propose the functional name ETT (ET transporter) instead of OCTN1. ET, all of which is absorbed from food, is an intracellular antioxidant with metal ion affinity. Its particular purpose is unresolved. Cells with expression of ETT accumulate ET to high levels and avidly retain it. By contrast, cells lacking ETT do not accumulate ET, because their plasma membrane is virtually impermeable for this compound. The real-time PCR expression profile of human ETT, with strong expression in CD71+ cells, is consistent with a pivotal function of ET in erythrocytes. Moreover, prominent expression of ETT in monocytes and SLC22A4 polymorphism associations suggest a protective role of ET in chronic inflammatory disorders.	eng	5256	5261	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	102	14	2005	Apr	05	D000818;D001483;D001693;D002352/Q000235;D002352/Q000378;D002460;D018076/Q000235;D004880/Q000378;D020869;D006801;D007249/Q000235;D007249/Q000378;D007700;D008565/Q000235;D008565/Q000378;D026901/Q000235;D026901/Q000378;D027701/Q000235;D027701/Q000378;D011392/Q000031;D011392/Q000378;D012333/Q000235;D012333/Q000378;D051381;D011994/Q000235;D011994/Q000378;D000074058;D000070590;D027981;D009626;D014018	Animals;Base Sequence;Biological Transport, Active;Carrier Proteins/genetics;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cell Line;DNA, Complementary/genetics;Ergothioneine/metabolism;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Inflammation/genetics;Inflammation/metabolism;Kinetics;Membrane Proteins/genetics;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics;Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism;Organic Cation Transport Proteins/genetics;Organic Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism;Proline/analogs & derivatives;Proline/metabolism;RNA, Messenger/genetics;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Rats;Recombinant Proteins/genetics;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Solute Carrier Family 22 Member 5;Solute Carrier Proteins;Symporters;Terminology as Topic;Tissue Distribution	Gründemann D;Harlfinger S;Golz S;Geerts A;Lazar A;Berkels R;Jung N;Rubbert A;Schömig E	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
709	15794947	cGMP (guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate) transport across human erythrocyte membranes.	Human erythrocytes produce cGMP that can be eliminated by phosphodiesterases or active efflux transporters. The efflux can be studied under controlled conditions as ATP-dependent uptake into inside-out membrane vesicles. However, widely differing values for the transport rates have been reported. We have here examined factors that influence the uptake rates measured and thus may explain these discrepancies. Both the ionic composition of the buffer used during uptake and the mode of vesicle preparation were found to affect the observed transport rates. Furthermore it was apparent that different blood donors expressed on their erythrocytes different amounts of both MRP4 and MRP5, transporters that have been putatively linked to cGMP efflux across erythrocyte membranes. These differences in expression were reflected in differences in rates of cGMP uptake into inside-out erythrocyte membrane vesicles. Calculations based on the transport rates observed using vesicles suggest that efflux may be the principal means for eliminating cGMP from human erythrocytes.	eng	1257	1262	Biochemical pharmacology	69	8	2005	Apr	15	D000255/Q000378;D001693;D015153;D002021;D006152/Q000378;D004591;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D027425/Q000378;D014316	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Biological Transport, Active;Blotting, Western;Buffers;Cyclic GMP/metabolism;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism;Tritium	Wu CP;Woodcock H;Hladky SB;Barrand MA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
710	16008534	Kynurenine metabolism in multiple sclerosis.	Objective--Excitatory amino acid receptors are involved in the normal physiology of the brain, and may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc. It has been demonstrated that the blockade of one of these receptors ameliorates the symptoms of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). In a recent study, a decreased level of kynurenic acid was found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS. The only known endogenous excitotoxin receptor antagonist is the tryptophan metabolite kynurenic acid. Another metabolite is quinolinic acid, which exerts different action: it is an excitotoxin receptor agonist. The ratio of these two metabolites is determined by the activities of kynurenine aminotransferase I and II (KAT I and KAT II). In this study, we measured the activities of these enzymes and the concentration of kynurenic acid in the red blood cells (RBC) and in the plasma of patients with MS. KAT activities were detected both in the RBC and in the plasma. As compared with the control subjects, the KAT I and KAT II activities were significantly higher in the RBC of the patients. The concentration of kynurenic acid is elevated in the plasma of MS patients, and there is a tendency to an elevation in the RBC. These changes may indicate a compensatory protective mechanism against excitatory neurotoxic effects. Our data demonstrate the involvement of the kynurenine system in the pathogenesis of MS, which may predict a novel therapeutic intervention.	eng	93	96	Acta neurologica Scandinavica	112	2	2005	Aug		D000293;D000328;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D007736/Q000097;D007736/Q000378;D007737/Q000378;D008297;D008875;D009103/Q000097;D009103/Q000201;D009103/Q000378;D012008;D000637/Q000097;D000637/Q000378;D015854/Q000502	Adolescent;Adult;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Kynurenic Acid/blood;Kynurenic Acid/metabolism;Kynurenine/metabolism;Male;Middle Aged;Multiple Sclerosis/blood;Multiple Sclerosis/enzymology;Multiple Sclerosis/metabolism;Recurrence;Transaminases/blood;Transaminases/metabolism;Up-Regulation/physiology	Hartai Z;Klivenyi P;Janaky T;Penke B;Dux L;Vecsei L	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True

The transport of various S-nitrosothiols, NO and NO donors in human red blood cells (RBC) and the formation of erythrocytic S-nitrosoglutathione were investigated. Of the NO species tested only S-nitrosocysteine was found to form S-nitrosoglutathione in the RBC cytosol. L-Serine, L-cysteine and L-lysine inhibited formation of S-nitrosoglutathione. Incubation of RBC pre-incubated with S-[15N]nitroso-L-cysteine with native plasma or platelet-rich plasma led to formation of S-[15N]nitrosoalbumin and inhibited platelet aggregation, respectively. The specific transporter system of S-nitroso-L-cysteine in the RBC membrane may have implications for formation of S-nitrosoalbumin and S-nitrosohemoglobin and for transport of NO bioactivity within the vasculature.	eng	4119	4124	FEBS letters	579	19	2005	Aug	01	D000244/Q000494;D000596/Q000378;D001692;D001808/Q000378;D003545/Q000031;D003545/Q000097;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D009569/Q000378;D010974/Q000187;D026403/Q000097;D026403/Q000378	Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology;Amino Acids/metabolism;Biological Transport;Blood Vessels/metabolism;Cysteine/analogs & derivatives;Cysteine/blood;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Nitric Oxide/metabolism;Platelet Aggregation/drug effects;S-Nitrosothiols/blood;S-Nitrosothiols/metabolism	Sandmann J;Schwedhelm KS;Tsikas D	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythro	True
712	16099471	Kynurenine metabolism in plasma and in red blood cells in Parkinson's disease.	Substantial evidence indicates that neuroactive kynurenine metabolites play a role in the normal physiology of the human brain, and are involved in the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). A sidearm product of the pathway, kynurenic acid (KYNA), which is synthesized by the irreversible transamination of kynurenine (KYN) by kynurenine aminotransferases (KAT I and KAT II), is an excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist. In the present study we measured the level of KYNA and the activities of the biosynthetic enzyme isoforms KAT I and KAT II in the plasma and in the erythrocytes (RBC) of 19 PD patients and 17 age-matched controls. The KAT I and KAT II activities were significantly lower in the plasma of PD patients, followed by a tendency to a decrease in plasma KYNA. An elevated KYNA level correlated with a significant increase in KAT II activity in the RBC of PD patients. These data support the contribution of an altered KYNA metabolism in the RBC to the pathogenesis of PD. The increased activity of KAT II in correlation with the elevated KYNA level in the RBC may mediate a consecutive protective response against excitatory neurotoxic effects.	eng	31	35	Journal of the neurological sciences	239	1	2005	Dec	15	D000222/Q000502;D000368;D001921/Q000201;D001921/Q000503;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007736/Q000097;D007737/Q000097;D008297;D008875;D010300/Q000097;D010300/Q000201;D010300/Q000503;D017470/Q000378;D000637/Q000097;D015854/Q000502	Adaptation, Physiological/physiology;Aged;Brain/enzymology;Brain/physiopathology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Kynurenic Acid/blood;Kynurenine/blood;Male;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease/blood;Parkinson Disease/enzymology;Parkinson Disease/physiopathology;Receptors, Glutamate/metabolism;Transaminases/blood;Up-Regulation/physiology	Hartai Z;Klivenyi P;Janaky T;Penke B;Dux L;Vecsei L	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
713	16364236	Phenothiazine maleates stimulate MRP1 transport activity in human erythrocytes.	The expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1) results in ATP-dependent reduction of drugs' concentration in cancer cells, i.e., multidrug resistance (MDR). Since the majority of projects are concentrated on the search of the new MDR modulators, there are very few reports on drug-induced stimulation of MDR transporters activity. In the present work, by means of functional fluorescence assay we have shown that MRP1-mediated efflux of 2',7'-bis-(3-carboxypropyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCPCF) out of human erythrocytes is stimulated by phenothiazine maleates that have been already identified as P-glycoprotein inhibitors. Phenothiazine maleates-induced stimulation of ATP-dependent uptake of 2',7'-bis-(3-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) into inside-out membrane vesicles prepared from erythrocyte membranes has been also demonstrated. Moreover, it was shown that phenothiazine maleates exerted stimulating effect on ATPase activity measured in erythrocyte membranes. To our best knowledge, this report is the first one demonstrating that compounds able to inhibit transport activity of P-glycoprotein can stimulate MRP1 transporter. We conclude that phenothiazine maleates probably exert their stimulatory effect on MRP1 by direct interaction with the protein at the site different from the substrate binding site.	eng	52	58	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1720	1-2	2005	Dec	30	D001553/Q000494;D017301/Q000378;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005452/Q000378;D006801;D008298/Q000494;D027425/Q000097;D010640/Q000494;D014638/Q000494	Benzbromarone/pharmacology;Ca(2+) Mg(2+)-ATPase/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fluoresceins/metabolism;Humans;Maleates/pharmacology;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/blood;Phenothiazines/pharmacology;Vanadates/pharmacology	Wesołowska O;Mosiadz D;Motohashi N;Kawase M;Michalak K	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
714	15353477	Abnormal regulation of Mg2+ transport via Na/Mg exchanger in sickle erythrocytes.	Erythrocyte magnesium (Mg2+) deficiency has been demonstrated in sickle cell disease to contribute to erythrocyte dehydration, K loss, and thus sickling. No studies have assessed the functional properties of the Na/Mg exchanger in sickle cell disease. Using Mg(2+)-loaded erythrocytes, we measured Mg2+ efflux induced by extracellular Na+. We estimated that the Na/Mg exchanger had higher maximal velocity, higher affinity for Na+, and lower cooperativity for Mg2+ in sickle than in normal erythrocytes. The activity of the exchanger was markedly decreased by hypotonic and hypertonic conditions in normal erythrocytes but not in sickle erythrocytes. Studies of density-separated erythrocytes showed that the activity of the exchanger decreased as the mean cellular hemoglobin concentration increased in normal but not in sickle erythrocytes. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) activity by calphostin C and chelerythrine increased the activity of the exchanger in normal but not in sickle erythrocytes. Inhibition of serine/threonine phosphatases did not affect the activity of the exchanger in either normal or sickle erythrocytes. Altogether, these data indicate that the Na/Mg exchanger is abnormally regulated in sickle erythrocytes. Therefore, Mg2+ depletion in sickle erythrocytes might be mediated by an up-regulated Na/Mg exchanger, possibly by dephosphorylation of the transporter or a closely associated regulator.	eng	382	386	Blood	105	1	2005	Jan	01	D000755/Q000097;D000755/Q000378;D000755/Q000473;D017920/Q000378;D004791/Q000494;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000473;D006801;D017136;D007700;D008274/Q000378;D009994;D010744/Q000037;D010744/Q000378;D010766;D011493/Q000378;D012964/Q000378	Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood;Anemia, Sickle Cell/metabolism;Anemia, Sickle Cell/pathology;Antiporters/metabolism;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/pathology;Humans;Ion Transport;Kinetics;Magnesium/metabolism;Osmolar Concentration;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism;Phosphorylation;Protein Kinase C/metabolism;Sodium/metabolism	Rivera A;Ferreira A;Bertoni D;Romero JR;Brugnara C	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
715	15968458	Evidence for essential catalytic determinants for human erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase.	Human erythrocyte pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase, PN-I, catalyzes the dephosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphates. The enzyme also possesses phosphotransferase activity, transferring phosphate groups between pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphates and various pyrimidine nucleosides. Deficiency of the enzyme activity is associated with a hemolytic anemia. PN-I cDNA has been expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding a fully active recombinant enzyme, which was purified to homogeneity and extensively characterized. Multiple sequence alignment of PN-I and homologues proteins revealed the existence of conserved regions, whose importance in catalysis was examined by performing experiments designed to intercept covalent intermediates as strongly suggested by our previous kinetic studies. Furthermore, a functional analysis of the enzyme was carried out through site-directed mutagenesis designed on the basis of the sequence of the identified conserved regions as well as mutations observed in PN-I-deficient patients.	eng	1613	1620	Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS	62	14	2005	Jul		D015720/Q000235;D015720/Q000302;D015720/Q000378;D000595;D003001;D004591;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D016297;D011994/Q000235;D011994/Q000302;D011994/Q000378;D016415;D017386;D013379	5'-Nucleotidase/genetics;5'-Nucleotidase/isolation & purification;5'-Nucleotidase/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Cloning, Molecular;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Mutagenesis, Site-Directed;Recombinant Proteins/genetics;Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Substrate Specificity	Amici A;Ciccioli K;Naponelli V;Raffaelli N;Magni G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
716	15987364	Amino-acid substitution in the disordered loop of blood group B-glycosyltransferase enzyme causes weak B phenotype.	Few studies have investigated the reaction kinetics and interactions with nucleotide donor and acceptor substrates of mutant human ABO glycosyltransferases. Previous work identified a B(w) allele featuring a 556G>A polymorphism giving rise to a weak B phenotype. This polymorphism is predicted to cause a M186V amino-acid mutation within a highly conserved series of 16 amino acids present both in both blood group A- and blood group B-synthesizing enzymes. These residues are known as the disordered loop because their location cannot be determined in the crystal structure of the enzyme. Another patient has been identified with a 556G>A B(w) allele and the kinetics of the resulting mutant glycosyltransferase were studied.	eng	1178	1182	Transfusion	45	7	2005	Jul		D000017/Q000737;D000017/Q000145;D000017/Q000235;D000017/Q000302;D000017/Q000378;D000328;D000595;D019943;D000818;D003198;D017124;D004926/Q000235;D005091;D005260;D005700/Q000737;D005700/Q000145;D005700/Q000235;D005700/Q000302;D005700/Q000378;D006801;D021621;D007700;D051379;D008958;D017350/Q000378;D021141;D010641;D011110;D017433;D017434;D017422;D013379;D014531/Q000378	ABO Blood-Group System/chemistry;ABO Blood-Group System/classification;ABO Blood-Group System/genetics;ABO Blood-Group System/isolation & purification;ABO Blood-Group System/metabolism;Adult;Amino Acid Sequence;Amino Acid Substitution;Animals;Computer Simulation;Conserved Sequence;Escherichia coli/genetics;Exons;Female;Galactosyltransferases/chemistry;Galactosyltransferases/classification;Galactosyltransferases/genetics;Galactosyltransferases/isolation & purification;Galactosyltransferases/metabolism;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Kinetics;Mice;Models, Molecular;N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases/metabolism;Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques;Phenotype;Polymorphism, Genetic;Protein Structure, Secondary;Protein Structure, Tertiary;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Substrate Specificity;Uridine Diphosphate Galactose/metabolism	Yazer MH;Denomme GA;Rose NL;Palcic MM	Journal, Articles								True

718	15788720	Reduction of arsenate to arsenite by human erythrocyte lysate and rat liver cytosol - characterization of a glutathione- and NAD-dependent arsenate reduction linked to glycolysis.	Reduction of arsenate (AsV) to the more toxic arsenite (AsIII) is of high toxicological importance, yet in vivo relevant enzymes involved have not been identified. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) is an efficient AsV reductase in vitro, but its role in AsV reduction is irrelevant in vivo. Intact human red blood cells (RBC) possess an AsV reductase activity that is PNP-independent, diminished by depletion of glutathione (GSH), enhanced by oxidants of erythrocytic NAD(P)H, and possibly linked to the lower part of the glycolytic pathway. In order to characterize this PNP-independent AsV reductase activity further, we examined the effects of GSH, inorganic phosphate, some inhibitors of glucose metabolism, glycolytic substrates, and pyridine, as well as adenine nucleotides on AsV reduction in lysed RBC and rat liver cytosol in the presence of BCX-1777, a PNP inhibitor. In hemolysate, GSH enhanced AsV reduction in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas phosphate inhibited it. Glycolytic substrates, especially fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoglyceric acids, improved AsV reductase activity. NAD, especially together with these substrates, strongly increased AsIII formation, whereas NADH strongly inhibited it. NADP and adenine nucleotides diminished, while 2-phosphoglycollate, which increases the breakdown of the RBC-specific compound 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate, doubled the AsV reductase activity. Although AsV reduction by the liver cytosol responded similarly to GSH, NAD, and glycolytic substrates as in the hemolysate, it was barely influenced by NADH, was diminished by 2-phosphoglycollate, and was stimulated by NADP. Collectively, hemolysate and rat liver cytosol possess a PNP-independent AsV reductase activity. This enzymatic activity requires GSH, NAD, and glycolytic substrates, and purportedly involves one or both of the two functionally linked glycolytic enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase. In addition, the data presented here suggest that yet another PNP-independent AsV reductase resides in the hepatic cytosol. Although this latter enzyme remains unknown, identification of the AsV reductase depending on GSH, NAD, and glycolytic substrates is presented in the following paper.	eng	847	858	Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology	85	2	2005	Jun		D000244/Q000494;D000255/Q000494;D000818;D001149/Q000378;D018053/Q000378;D003600/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D005978/Q000378;D005978/Q000494;D006019/Q000502;D066298;D008099/Q000378;D008297;D009243/Q000378;D009243/Q000494;D009249/Q000494;D010084;D010710/Q000494;D051381;D017208	Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology;Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology;Animals;Arsenates/metabolism;Arsenites/metabolism;Cytosol/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Glutathione/metabolism;Glutathione/pharmacology;Glycolysis/physiology;In Vitro Techniques;Liver/metabolism;Male;NAD/metabolism;NAD/pharmacology;NADP/pharmacology;Oxidation-Reduction;Phosphates/pharmacology;Rats;Rats, Wistar	Németi B;Gregus Z	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;erythrocyte;RBC	True
719	15911086	Multiple isoforms of the KC1 cotransporter are expressed in sickle and normal erythroid cells.	The KCl cotransporter (KCC) plays an important role in cellular cation and volume regulation and contributes to the process of volume reduction that accompanies reticulocyte maturation. In human red cells containing sickle hemoglobin, KCl cotransporter activity is high compared to normal cells, and contributes to the deleterious dehydration of sickle reticulocytes. To date, genes for four KCC isoforms have been identified. As a step toward determining which isoform(s) is responsible for the Cl-dependent K fluxes in reticulocytes, human erythroid cells were examined for the presence of various KCC isoform transcripts.	eng	624	631	Experimental hematology	33	6	2005	Jun		D000755/Q000276;D000755/Q000473;D002478;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D020033/Q000235;D020033/Q000378;D012326;D012333/Q000235;D020133;D027981/Q000235;D027981/Q000378;D000096922	Anemia, Sickle Cell/immunology;Anemia, Sickle Cell/pathology;Cells, Cultured;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Protein Isoforms/genetics;Protein Isoforms/metabolism;RNA Splicing;RNA, Messenger/genetics;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Symporters/genetics;Symporters/metabolism;K Cl- Cotransporters	Crable SC;Hammond SM;Papes R;Rettig RK;Zhou GP;Gallagher PG;Joiner CH;Anderson KP	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red cell;erythro	True
720	15917509	Phosphorylation of ribavirin and viramidine by adenosine kinase and cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II: Implications for ribavirin metabolism in erythrocytes.	Many nucleoside analog drugs, such as ribavirin and viramidine, are activated or metabolized in vivo through 5'-phosphorylation. In this report, we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for 5'-monophosphorylation of ribavirin and viramidine by adenosine kinase. The apparent Km for ribavirin is 540 microM, and k(cat) is 1.8 min-1. Its catalytic efficiency of 3.3 x 10(-3) min-1 . microM-1 is 1,200-fold lower than that of adenosine. In contrast to the common belief that ribavirin is exclusively phosphorylated by adenosine kinase, cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II was found to catalyze ribavirin phosphorylation in vitro. The reaction is optimally stimulated by the physiological concentration of ATP or 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. In phosphate-buffered saline plus ATP and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, the apparent Km for ribavirin is 88 microM, and k(cat) is 4.0 min-1. These findings suggest that cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II may be involved in ribavirin phosphorylation in vivo. Like ribavirin, viramidine was found to be phosphorylated by either adenosine kinase or cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II, albeit with a much lower activity. The catalytic efficiency for viramidine phosphorylation is 10- to 330-fold lower than that of ribavirin, suggesting that other nucleoside kinase(s) may be involved in viramidine phosphorylation in vivo. Both ribavirin and viramidine are not phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase and uridine-cytidine kinase. The coincidence of presence of high concentrated 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes suggests that cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II could play an important role in phosphorylating ribavirin and contribute to anabolism of ribavirin triphosphate in erythrocytes. Elucidation of ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation mechanism should shed light on their in vivo metabolism, especially the ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia in erythrocytes.	eng	2164	2171	Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy	49	6	2005	Jun		D015720/Q000378;D000248/Q000378;D000818;D000998/Q000378;D006224;D003600/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D010766;D012254/Q000031;D012254/Q000737;D012254/Q000378	5'-Nucleotidase/metabolism;Adenosine Kinase/metabolism;Animals;Antiviral Agents/metabolism;Cricetinae;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Phosphorylation;Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives;Ribavirin/chemistry;Ribavirin/metabolism	Wu JZ;Larson G;Walker H;Shim JH;Hong Z	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
721	15611095	Modulation of erythrocyte membrane mechanical function by protein 4.1 phosphorylation.	Erythrocyte membrane mechanical function is regulated by the spectrin-based membrane skeleton composed of alpha- and beta-spectrin, actin, protein 4.1R (4.1R), and adducin. Post-translational modifications of these proteins have been suggested to modulate membrane mechanical function. Indeed, beta-spectrin phosphorylation by casein kinase I has been shown to decrease membrane mechanical stability. However, the effects of the phosphorylation of skeletal proteins by protein kinase C (PKC), a serine/threonine kinase, have not been elucidated. In the present study, we explored the functional consequences of the phosphorylation of 4.1R and adducin by PKC. We identified Ser-312 in 4.1R as the PKC phosphorylation site. Using antibodies raised against phosphopeptides of 4.1R and adducin, we documented significant differences in the time course of phosphorylation of adducin and 4.1R by PKC. Although adducin was phosphorylated rapidly by the activation of membrane-bound atypical PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation, there was a significant delay in the phosphorylation of 4.1R because of delayed recruitment of conventional PKC from cytosol to the membrane. This differential time course in the phosphorylation of 4.1R and adducin in conjunction with membrane mechanical stability measurements enabled us to document that, although phosphorylation of adducin by PKC has little effect on membrane mechanical stability, additional phosphorylation of 4.1R results in a marked decrease in membrane mechanical stability. We further showed that the phosphorylation of 4.1R by PKC results in its decreased ability to form a ternary complex with spectrin and actin as well as dissociation of glycophorin C from the membrane skeleton. These findings have enabled us to define a regulatory role for 4.1R phosphorylation in dynamic regulation of red cell membrane properties.	eng	7581	7587	The Journal of biological chemistry	280	9	2005	Mar	04	D000199/Q000737;D001665;D001798/Q000378;D002148/Q000737;D047389/Q000378;D002462/Q000378;D003598;D003600/Q000378;D004305;D004591;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D015151;D008565;D008869/Q000378;D008954;D010766;D011485;D011493/Q000378;D011499;D017434;D012694/Q000737;D012967/Q000737;D013049/Q000378;D013755/Q000494;D013997	Actins/chemistry;Binding Sites;Blood Proteins/metabolism;Calmodulin-Binding Proteins/chemistry;Casein Kinase I/metabolism;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Cytoskeletal Proteins;Cytosol/metabolism;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Immunoblotting;Membrane Proteins;Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism;Models, Biological;Phosphorylation;Protein Binding;Protein Kinase C/metabolism;Protein Processing, Post-Translational;Protein Structure, Tertiary;Serine/chemistry;Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate/chemistry;Spectrin/metabolism;Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology;Time Factors	Manno S;Takakuwa Y;Mohandas N	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
722	15741229	Stimulation of erythrocyte ceramide formation by platelet-activating factor.	Osmotic erythrocyte shrinkage leads to activation of cation channels with subsequent Ca2+ entry and stimulates a sphingomyelinase with subsequent formation of ceramide. Ca2+ and ceramide then activate a scramblase leading to breakdown of phosphatidylserine asymmetry of the cell membrane. The mediators accounting for activation of erythrocyte sphingomyelinase and phosphatidylserine exposure remained elusive. The study demonstrates that platelet-activating factor (PAF) is released from erythrocytes upon hyperosmotic cell shrinkage. The experiments further disclose the presence of PAF receptors in erythrocytes and show that PAF stimulates the breakdown of sphingomyelin and the release of ceramide from erythrocytes at isotonic conditions. PAF further triggers cell shrinkage (decrease of forward scatter) and phosphatidylserine exposure (annexin binding) of erythrocytes. The stimulation of annexin-binding is blunted by a genetic knockout of PAF receptors, by the PAF receptor antagonist ABT491 or by inhibition of sphingomyelinase with urea. In conclusion, PAF activates an erythrocyte sphingomyelinase and the then formed ceramide leads to the activation of scramblase with subsequent phosphatidylserine exposure.	eng	1233	1243	Journal of cell science	118	Pt 6	2005	Mar	15	D017302/Q000378;D017209;D001792/Q000378;D015153;D002118/Q000378;D002469;D002518/Q000378;D003600/Q000378;D003902/Q000494;D004305;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005434;D006801;D007962/Q000378;D017830/Q000494;D010718/Q000378;D010972/Q000378;D010980/Q000378;D043562/Q000378;D013108/Q000378;D013696;D013997	Annexins/metabolism;Apoptosis;Blood Platelets/metabolism;Blotting, Western;Calcium/metabolism;Cell Separation;Ceramides/metabolism;Cytosol/metabolism;Detergents/pharmacology;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Flow Cytometry;Humans;Leukocytes/metabolism;Octoxynol/pharmacology;Phosphatidylserines/metabolism;Platelet Activating Factor/metabolism;Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism;Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism;Temperature;Time Factors	Lang PA;Kempe DS;Tanneur V;Eisele K;Klarl BA;Myssina S;Jendrossek V;Ishii S;Shimizu T;Waidmann M;Hessler G;Huber SM;Lang F;Wieder T	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
723	15811525	LANCL1, an erythrocyte protein recruited to the Maurer's clefts during Plasmodium falciparum development.	As the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum develops inside the erythrocyte, parasite-derived membrane structures, referred to as Maurer's clefts, play an important role in parasite development by delivering parasite proteins to the host cell surface, and participating in the assembly of the cytoadherence complex, essential for the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. PfSBP1 is an integral membrane protein of the clefts, interacting with an erythrocyte cytosolic protein, identified here as the human Lantibiotic synthetase component C-like protein LANCL1. LANCL1 is specifically recruited to the surface of Maurer's clefts in P. falciparum mature blood stages. We propose that the interaction between PfSBP1 and LANCL1 is central for late steps of the parasite development to prevent premature rupture of the red blood cell membrane.	eng	39	47	Molecular and biochemical parasitology	141	1	2005	May		D000595;D000818;D002352/Q000378;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005455;D006801;D007425/Q000378;D008565/Q000378;D008969;D008970;D010446/Q000378;D010963/Q000254;D010963/Q000378;D011485;D015800/Q000378;D043562/Q000737;D043562/Q000235;D043562/Q000378;D011993/Q000378	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fluorescent Antibody Technique;Humans;Intracellular Membranes/metabolism;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Molecular Weight;Peptide Fragments/metabolism;Plasmodium falciparum/growth & development;Plasmodium falciparum/metabolism;Protein Binding;Protozoan Proteins/metabolism;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/chemistry;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism;Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism	Blisnick T;Vincensini L;Barale JC;Namane A;Braun Breton C	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True

725	16227996	Identification of a ferrireductase required for efficient transferrin-dependent iron uptake in erythroid cells.	The reduction of iron is an essential step in the transferrin (Tf) cycle, which is the dominant pathway for iron uptake by red blood cell precursors. A deficiency in iron acquisition by red blood cells leads to hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Using a positional cloning strategy, we identified a gene, six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3 (Steap3), responsible for the iron deficiency anemia in the mouse mutant nm1054. Steap3 is expressed highly in hematopoietic tissues, colocalizes with the Tf cycle endosome and facilitates Tf-bound iron uptake. Steap3 shares homology with F(420)H(2):NADP(+) oxidoreductases found in archaea and bacteria, as well as with the yeast FRE family of metalloreductases. Overexpression of Steap3 stimulates the reduction of iron, and mice lacking Steap3 are deficient in erythroid ferrireductase activity. Taken together, these findings indicate that Steap3 is an endosomal ferrireductase required for efficient Tf-dependent iron uptake in erythroid cells.	eng	1264	1269	Nature genetics	37	11	2005	Nov		D000595;D018798/Q000378;D000818;D000951/Q000235;D000951/Q000378;D015153;D002478;D011992;D004912/Q000201;D038181/Q000235;D038181/Q000378;D005260;D018390;D007501/Q000378;D007668/Q000378;D008297;D051379;D008817;D008969;D010088;D012190/Q000235;D017386;D013347;D014168/Q000378	Amino Acid Sequence;Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/metabolism;Animals;Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics;Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism;Blotting, Western;Cells, Cultured;Endosomes;Erythrocytes/enzymology;FMN Reductase/genetics;FMN Reductase/metabolism;Female;Gene Targeting;Iron/metabolism;Kidney/metabolism;Male;Mice;Mice, Mutant Strains;Molecular Sequence Data;Oxidoreductases;Retroviridae/genetics;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Subcellular Fractions;Transferrin/metabolism	Ohgami RS;Campagna DR;Greer EL;Antiochos B;McDonald A;Chen J;Sharp JJ;Fujiwara Y;Barker JE;Fleming MD	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythro	True

However, the results of the present study reveal that a large amount of endogenous alpha-tocopherol in human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the absence of any other antioxidants may initiate additional free radical propagation under low concentration of free radical initiator (i.e., 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane hydrochloride) [AAPH], a water-soluble free radical source) to peroxide polyunsaturated fatty acids in LDL in the manner of alpha-tocopherol-mediated peroxidation (TMP). Whether the addition of high concentration of exogenous alpha-tocopherol to human erythrocytes under low concentration of AAPH can also drive TMP is the concern in this research work. Moreover, the hemolysis extent of human erythrocytes peroxidized by AAPH is followed easily by the determination of the hemoglobin outside the erythrocytes. A series of observations on various concentrations of AAPH-induced hemolysis in the presence of various concentrations of exogenous alpha-tocopherol demonstrates that the high concentration of exogenous alpha-tocopherol, coupled with low concentration of AAPH, can initiate TMP in the free-radical-induced peroxidation of human erythrocytes system as well. This result provides direct evidence to support TMP theory and expands its application into in vitro erythrocyte system.	eng	233	239	Cell biochemistry and biophysics	44	2	2006			D000578/Q000494;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000473;D005609/Q000378;D006461;D006801;D015227/Q000187;D008077/Q000378;D014810/Q000378;D024502/Q000378	Amidines/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/pathology;Free Radicals/metabolism;Hemolysis;Humans;Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects;Lipoproteins, LDL/metabolism;Vitamin E/metabolism;alpha-Tocopherol/metabolism	Liu ZQ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
727	16923725	Reduced number of CFTR molecules in erythrocyte plasma membrane of cystic fibrosis patients.	Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common genetic disease among Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). The most frequent mutation, DeltaF508, results in protein misfolding and, as a consequence, prevents CFTR from reaching its final location at the cell surface. CFTR is expressed in various cell types including red blood cells. The functional role of CFTR in erythrocytes is still unclear. Since the number of CFTR copies in a single erythrocyte of healthy donors and CF patients with a homozygous DeltaF508 mutation is unknown, we counted CFTR, localized in erythrocyte plasma membrane, at the single molecule level. A novel experimental approach combining atomic force microscopy with quantum-dot-labeled anti-CFTR antibodies, used as topographic surface markers, was employed to detect individual CFTR molecules. Analysis of erythrocyte plasma membranes taken from healthy donors and CF patients with a homozygous DeltaF508 mutation reveals mean (SEM) values of 698 (12.8) (n=542) and 172 (3.8) (n=538) CFTR molecules per red blood cell, respectively. We conclude that erythrocytes reflect the CFTR status of the organism and that quantification of CFTR in a blood sample could be useful in the diagnosis of CFTR related diseases.	eng	317	323	Molecular membrane biology	23	4	2006			D000906/Q000276;D002462/Q000737;D002462/Q000648;D003550/Q000175;D019005/Q000032;D004910/Q000737;D004910/Q000648;D006801;D007150/Q000379;D018625/Q000379;D045663	Antibodies/immunology;Cell Membrane/chemistry;Cell Membrane/ultrastructure;Cystic Fibrosis/diagnosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/analysis;Erythrocyte Membrane/chemistry;Erythrocyte Membrane/ultrastructure;Humans;Immunohistochemistry/methods;Microscopy, Atomic Force/methods;Quantum Dots	Lange T;Jungmann P;Haberle J;Falk S;Duebbers A;Bruns R;Ebner A;Hinterdorfer P;Oberleithner H;Schillers H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
728	16549536	Erythrocyte metabolism and antioxidant status of patients with Wilson disease with hemolytic anemia.	Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to the defect in ATP7B gene characterized by excessive accumulation of copper in the liver with progressive hepatic damage and subsequent redistribution to various extrahepatic tissues including the brain, kidneys, and cornea. Strikingly, the total serum copper concentration is always low in WD, even though the non-ceruloplasmin copper level is still expected to be high. To assess the role of free radical reactions catalyzed by non-ceruloplasmin copper, we investigated erythrocyte metabolism and oxidative stress as a mechanism for hemolysis in eight WD patients during episodes of acute hemolysis and compared them with eight follow-up cases of WD on d-penicillamine therapy and eight healthy, age-matched children. Elevated levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper were found in all the WD patients during an episode of hemolytic anemia. There was marked inhibition in erythrocyte enzymes, namely, hexokinase, total adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) from WD patients compared with patients on penicillamine and healthy children, indicating altered erythrocyte metabolism during a hemolytic crisis. Antioxidant status was also found to be compromised as is evident from decreased glutathione (GSH) levels, decreased antioxidant enzymes (namely, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase), increased lipid peroxidation, and deranged plasma antioxidants. Uric acid showed maximum decrease followed by ascorbic acid. These findings suggest that the free radical production by elevated non-ceruloplasmin copper through transition metal catalyzed reactions leads to oxidative injury resulting in altered erythrocyte metabolism and severely compromised antioxidant status of WD patients during hemolytic anemia.	eng	593	597	Pediatric research	59	4 Pt 1	2006	Apr		D000293;D000743/Q000235;D000743/Q000378;D000975/Q000378;D002570/Q000378;D002648;D003300/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006527/Q000235;D006527/Q000378;D006801;D008297;D010949/Q000378	Adolescent;Anemia, Hemolytic/genetics;Anemia, Hemolytic/metabolism;Antioxidants/metabolism;Ceruloplasmin/metabolism;Child;Copper/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Hepatolenticular Degeneration/genetics;Hepatolenticular Degeneration/metabolism;Humans;Male;Plasma/metabolism	Attri S;Sharma N;Jahagirdar S;Thapa BR;Prasad R	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
729	16608173	The seleno bis(S-glutathionyl) arsinium ion is assembled in erythrocyte lysate.	Approximately 75 million people are currently exposed to arsenic concentrations in drinking water, which is associated with the development of internal cancers. One way to ameliorate this undesirable situation is to remove arsenic (arsenite and arsenate) from drinking water. An alternative approach is the development of an inexpensive palliative dietary supplement that promotes the excretion of intestinally absorbed arsenite from the body. To this end, the simultaneous administration of New Zealand white rabbits with arsenite and selenite resulted in the biliary excretion of the seleno-bis (S-glutathionyl) arsinium ion, [(GS)2AsSe]-. This apparent detoxification mechanism has been recently extended to environmentally relevant doses [Gailer, J., Ruprecht, L., Reitmeir, P., Benker, B., and Schramel, P. (2004) Appl. Organometal. Chem. 18, 670-675]. The site of formation of this excretory product in the organism, however, is unknown. To investigate if [(GS)2AsSe]- is formed in rabbit blood, we added arsenite and selenite and analyzed blood aliquots using arsenic and selenium X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The characteristic arsenic and selenium X-ray absorption spectra of [(GS)2AsSe]- were detected within 2 min after addition and comprised 95% of the blood selenium 30 min after addition. To elucidate if erythrocytes are involved in the biosynthesis of [(GS)2AsSe]- in blood, arsenite and 77Se-selenite were added to rabbit erythrocyte lysate and the obtained solution was analyzed by 77Se NMR spectroscopy (273 K). This resulted in a 77Se NMR signal with a chemical shift identical to that of synthetic [(GS)2AsSe]- added to lysate. Combined, these results demonstrate that [(GS)2AsSe]- is rapidly formed in blood and that erythrocytes are an important site for the in vivo formation of this toxicologically important metabolite.	eng	601	607	Chemical research in toxicology	19	4	2006	Apr		D000818;D004912/Q000737;D007477/Q000737;D009682;D011817;D018036/Q000737;D013057/Q000379;D014965	Animals;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Ions/chemistry;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Rabbits;Selenium Compounds/chemistry;Spectrum Analysis/methods;X-Rays	Manley SA;George GN;Pickering IJ;Glass RS;Prenner EJ;Yamdagni R;Wu Q;Gailer J	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
730	16861337	In-depth analysis of the membrane and cytosolic proteome of red blood cells.	In addition to transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the tissues, a range of other functions are attributed to red blood cells (RBCs) of vertebrates. Diseases compromising RBC performance in any of these functions warrant in-depth study. Furthermore, the human RBC is a vital host cell for the malaria parasite. Much has been learned from classical biochemical approaches about RBC composition and membrane organization. Here, we use mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics to characterize the normal RBC protein profile. The aim of this study was to obtain the most complete and informative human RBC proteome possible by combining high-accuracy, high-sensitivity protein identification technology (quadrupole time of flight and Fourier transform MS) with selected biochemical procedures for sample preparation. A total of 340 membrane proteins and 252 soluble proteins were identified, validated, and categorized in terms of subcellular localization, protein family, and function. Splice isoforms of proteins were identified, and polypeptides that migrated with anomalously high or low apparent molecular weights could be grouped into either ubiquitinylated, partially degraded, or ester-linked complexes. Our data reveal unexpected complexity of the RBC proteome, provide a wealth of data on its composition, shed light on several open issues in RBC biology, and form a departure point for comprehensive understanding of RBC functions.	eng	791	801	Blood	108	3	2006	Aug	01	D003600/Q000737;D004910/Q000737;D004912/Q000737;D006801;D013058/Q000379;D008565/Q000032;D008565/Q000502;D020033/Q000032;D011506/Q000032;D011506/Q000502;D020543/Q000032;D020543/Q000502;D040901/Q000379;D012995	Cytosol/chemistry;Erythrocyte Membrane/chemistry;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Humans;Mass Spectrometry/methods;Membrane Proteins/analysis;Membrane Proteins/physiology;Protein Isoforms/analysis;Proteins/analysis;Proteins/physiology;Proteome/analysis;Proteome/physiology;Proteomics/methods;Solubility	Pasini EM;Kirkegaard M;Mortensen P;Lutz HU;Thomas AW;Mann M	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
731	17130508	Reduced expression of G(i) in erythrocytes of humans with type 2 diabetes is associated with impairment of both cAMP generation and ATP release.	Human erythrocytes, by virtue of their ability to release ATP in response to physiological stimuli, have been proposed to participate in the regulation of local blood flow. A signal transduction pathway that relates these stimuli to ATP release has been described and includes the heterotrimeric G protein G(i) and adenylyl cyclase (AC). In this cell, G(i) activation results in increases in cAMP and, ultimately, ATP release. It has been reported that G(i) expression is decreased in animal models of diabetes and in platelets of humans with type 2 diabetes. Here, we report that G(i2) expression is selectively decreased in erythrocytes of humans with type 2 diabetes and that this defect is associated with reductions in cAMP accumulation and ATP release in response to incubation of erythrocytes with mastoparan 7 (10 micromol/l), an activator of G(i). Importantly, this defect in ATP release correlates inversely with the adequacy of glycemic control as determined by levels of HbA(1c) (A1C). These results demonstrate that in erythrocytes of humans with type 2 diabetes, both G(i) expression and ATP release in response to mastoparan 7 are impaired, which is consistent with the hypothesis that this defect in erythrocyte physiology could contribute to the vascular disease associated with this clinical condition.	eng	3588	3593	Diabetes	55	12	2006	Dec		D000255/Q000097;D000242/Q000097;D003924/Q000097;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D019206/Q000097;D006442;D006801;D036341;D010455/Q000494;D012016	Adenosine Triphosphate/blood;Cyclic AMP/blood;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/blood;Glycated Hemoglobin;Humans;Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins;Peptides/pharmacology;Reference Values	Sprague RS;Stephenson AH;Bowles EA;Stumpf MS;Lonigro AJ	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
732	17068337	Human erythrocyte membranes contain a cytochrome b561 that may be involved in extracellular ascorbate recycling.	Human erythrocytes contain an unidentified plasma membrane redox system that can reduce extracellular monodehydroascorbate by using intracellular ascorbate (Asc) as an electron donor. Here we show that human erythrocyte membranes contain a cytochrome b(561) (Cyt b(561)) and hypothesize that it may be responsible for this activity. Of three evolutionarily closely related Cyts b(561), immunoblots of human erythrocyte membranes showed only the duodenal cytochrome b(561) (DCytb) isoform. DCytb was also found in guinea pig erythrocyte membranes but not in erythrocyte membranes from the mouse or rat. Mouse erythrocytes lost a majority of the DCytb in the late erythroblast stage during erythropoiesis. Absorption spectroscopy showed that human erythrocyte membranes contain an Asc-reducible b-type Cyt having the same spectral characteristics as recombinant DCytb and biphasic reduction kinetics, similar to those of the chromaffin granule Cyt b(561). In contrast, mouse erythrocytes did not exhibit Asc-reducible b-type Cyt activity. Furthermore, in contrast to mouse erythrocytes, human erythrocytes much more effectively preserved extracellular Asc and transferred electrons from intracellular Asc to extracellular ferricyanide. These results suggest that the DCytb present in human erythrocytes may contribute to their ability to reduce extracellular monodehydroascorbate.	eng	39852	39859	The Journal of biological chemistry	281	52	2006	Dec	29	D000818;D001205/Q000378;D002460;D002837/Q000201;D003573/Q000096;D003573/Q000235;D003573/Q000502;D003683/Q000031;D003683/Q000378;D004386/Q000201;D004910/Q000201;D005110/Q000201;D005110/Q000378;D006168;D006801;D008247/Q000201;D008565/Q000502;D051379;D010084;D010088/Q000502;D051381	Animals;Ascorbic Acid/metabolism;Cell Line;Chromaffin Granules/enzymology;Cytochrome b Group/biosynthesis;Cytochrome b Group/genetics;Cytochrome b Group/physiology;Dehydroascorbic Acid/analogs & derivatives;Dehydroascorbic Acid/metabolism;Duodenum/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Extracellular Space/enzymology;Extracellular Space/metabolism;Guinea Pigs;Humans;Lysosomes/enzymology;Membrane Proteins/physiology;Mice;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidoreductases/physiology;Rats	Su D;May JM;Koury MJ;Asard H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True

Part of the fructosamines that are bound to intracellular proteins are repaired by fructosamine 3-kinase (FN3K). Because subject-to-subject variations in erythrocyte FN3K activity could affect the level of glycated haemoglobin independently of differences in blood glucose level, we explored if such variability existed, if it was genetically determined by the FN3K locus on 17q25 and if the FN3K activity correlated inversely with the level of glycated haemoglobin.	eng	31	39	Diabetes & metabolism	32	1	2006	Feb		D000328;D001483;D017931;D003922/Q000097;D003922/Q000201;D003922/Q000235;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D014644;D005838;D006442/Q000378;D006031;D006801;D008239/Q000031;D008239/Q000097;D008297;D008875;D017853/Q000097;D017853/Q000235;D011110;D012016	Adult;Base Sequence;DNA Primers;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/blood;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/enzymology;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/genetics;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Genetic Variation;Genotype;Glycated Hemoglobin/metabolism;Glycosylation;Humans;Lysine/analogs & derivatives;Lysine/blood;Male;Middle Aged;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/blood;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Reference Values	Delpierre G;Veiga-da-Cunha M;Vertommen D;Buysschaert M;Van Schaftingen E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

"Recent studies have suggested that Rap1 and Rap2 small GTP-binding proteins are both expressed in human red blood cells (RBCs). In this work, we carefully examined the expression of Rap proteins in leukocytes- and platelets-depleted RBCs, whose purity was established on the basis of the selective expression of the beta2 subunit of the Na+/K+ -ATPase, as verified according to the recently proposed ""beta-profiling test"" [J.F.

RT-PCR analysis of mRNA extracted from highly purified reticulocytes confirmed the expression of Rap2b, but not Rap2a, Rap2c, Rap1a or Rap1b. In RBCs, Rap2 was membrane-associated and was rapidly activated upon treatment with Ca2+/Ca2+ -ionophore. In addition, Rap2 segregated and was selectively enriched into microvesicles released by Ca2+ -activated RBCs, suggesting a possible role for this GTPase in membrane shedding."	eng	330	335	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1763	3	2006	Mar		D004912/Q000378;D006801;D012333/Q000235;D012333/Q000378;D022161/Q000502;D020668/Q000235;D020668/Q000378;D020827/Q000235;D020827/Q000378	Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;RNA, Messenger/genetics;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Transport Vesicles/physiology;rap GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics;rap GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism;rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics;rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism	Greco F;Ciana A;Pietra D;Balduini C;Minetti G;Torti M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;erythrocyte;RBC	True

737	17651993	Comparison of the effect of phenol and its derivatives on protein and free radical formation in human erythrocytes (in vitro).	The effect of phenolic compounds: phenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), 2,4-dimethylphenol (2,4-DMP) and catechol on human erythrocytes was studied. The level of fluorescent label - 6-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA) oxidation by phenolic compounds in erythrocytes as well as the carbonyl group content and hemoglobin denaturation were monitored. H(2)DCFDA has been utilized extensively as a marker for studies of oxidative stress at the cellular level. We noted that 2,4-DCP, 2,4-DMP and catechol induced an increase in the concentration- and time-dependent H(2)DCFDA oxidation. We also observed an increase in carbonyl group content and the changes in parameter T (denaturation of hemoglobin) in erythrocytes incubated with 2,4-DCP, catechol and 2,4-DMP. The highest level of H(2)DCFDA oxidation was provoked by 2,4-DCP. The biggest changes of proteins in erythrocytes measured as the carbonyl group content were induced by 2,4-DMP, but measured as parameter T they were induced by catechol. It was observed that phenol did not oxidize H(2)DCFDA up to the concentration of 2.5 mM after 3 h of incubation. Phenol did not affect the carbonyl group content but decreased parameter T (induced denaturation of hemoglobin). To sum up, the kind of the substituent in a phenolic ring determines the molecular mechanism of action of the individual compound and the capacity of reactive oxygen species generation and thus damages the specified structures in human erythrocytes.	eng	238	244	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	39	3	2007			D002396/Q000633;D002733/Q000633;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005452/Q000378;D005609/Q000378;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D010084;D018384;D010636/Q000633;D050050;D014992/Q000633	Catechols/toxicity;Chlorophenols/toxicity;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fluoresceins/metabolism;Free Radicals/metabolism;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Phenols/toxicity;Protein Carbonylation;Xylenes/toxicity	Bukowska B;Michałowicz J;Krokosz A;Sicińska P	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
738	17710652	Flow cytometric monitoring of multidrug drug resistance protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) -mediated transport of 2',7'-bis-(3-carboxypropyl)-5-(and-6)- carboxyfluorescein (BCPCF) into human erythrocyte membrane inside-out vesicles.	The presence of human multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) in the human erythrocyte membrane is well established. In the present study, flow cytometric monitoring is introduced to identify MRP1 as the main transporter of 2',7'-bis-(3-carboxypropyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCPCF) in the erythrocyte membrane and to facilitate inhibition and kinetic studies of MRP1-mediated transport. The ATP-dependent transport of BCPCF into human erythrocyte inside-out vesicles and, for comparison, into MRP1-expressing Sf9 cell membrane inside-out vesicles were studied. The MRP1-specific monoclonal antibody, QCRL-3 and the MRP1 inhibitor, MK-571 strongly decreased the uptake of BCPCF into both erythrocyte and MRP1-expressing Sf9 cell membrane inside-out vesicles. The inhibition profiles of cyclosporin A, verapamil, benzbromarone, and probenecid in erythrocyte membrane vesicles were typical for MRP1-mediated transport. Furthermore, kinetic constants K(m) and V(max) of BCPCF transport into erythrocyte membrane inside-out vesicles were determined in the absence and in the presence of selected inhibitors (MK-571, cyclosporin A, benzbromarone and verapamil). The presented results identified MRP1 as the major transporter of BCPCF in the human erythrocyte membrane and showed for the first time that the active transport of fluorescent substrate into inside-out vesicles can be monitored by flow cytometry.	eng	485	495	Molecular membrane biology	24	5-6	2007			D000255/Q000378;D000255/Q000494;D000818;D001553/Q000494;D001692/Q000187;D002460;D002462/Q000378;D016572/Q000494;D004305;D004910/Q000378;D005434;D005452/Q000378;D005452/Q000493;D006801;D007700;D027425/Q000037;D027425/Q000502;D011339/Q000494;D011422/Q000494;D011804/Q000494;D018411;D014700/Q000494	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology;Animals;Benzbromarone/pharmacology;Biological Transport/drug effects;Cell Line;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Cyclosporine/pharmacology;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Flow Cytometry;Fluoresceins/metabolism;Fluoresceins/pharmacokinetics;Humans;Kinetics;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/physiology;Probenecid/pharmacology;Propionates/pharmacology;Quinolines/pharmacology;Spodoptera;Verapamil/pharmacology	Bobrowska-Hägerstrand M;Wróbel A;Rychlik B;Ohman I;Hägerstrand H	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

740	17109629	Functional properties of multiple isoforms of human divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (DMT1).	DMT1 (divalent metal-ion transporter 1) is a widely expressed metal-ion transporter that is vital for intestinal iron absorption and iron utilization by most cell types throughout the body, including erythroid precursors. Mutations in DMT1 cause severe microcytic anaemia in animal models. Four DMT1 isoforms that differ in their N- and C-termini arise from mRNA transcripts that vary both at their 5'-ends (starting in exon 1A or exon 1B) and at their 3'-ends giving rise to mRNAs containing (+) or lacking (-) the 3'-IRE (iron-responsive element) and resulting in altered C-terminal coding sequences. To determine whether these variations result in functional differences between isoforms, we explored the functional properties of each isoform using the voltage clamp and radiotracer assays in cRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes. 1A/IRE+-DMT1 mediated Fe2+-evoked currents that were saturable (K(0.5)(Fe) approximately 1-2 microM), temperature-dependent (Q10 approximately 2), H+-dependent (K(0.5)(H) approximately 1 muM) and voltage-dependent. 1A/IRE+-DMT1 exhibited the provisional substrate profile (ranked on currents) Cd2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Mn2+>Ni2+, V3+>>Pb2+. Zn2+ also evoked large currents; however, the zinc-evoked current was accounted for by H+ and Cl- conductances and was not associated with significant Zn2+ transport. 1B/IRE+-DMT1 exhibited the same substrate profile, Fe2+ affinity and dependence on the H+ electrochemical gradient. Each isoform mediated 55Fe2+ uptake and Fe2+-evoked currents at low extracellular pH. Whereas iron transport activity varied markedly between the four isoforms, the activity for each correlated with the density of anti-DMT1 immunostaining in the plasma membrane, and the turnover rate of the Fe2+ transport cycle did not differ between isoforms. Therefore all four isoforms of human DMT1 function as metal-ion transporters of equivalent efficiency. Our results reveal that the N- and C-terminal sequence variations among the DMT1 isoforms do not alter DMT1 functional properties. We therefore propose that these variations serve as tissue-specific signals or cues to direct DMT1 to the appropriate subcellular compartments (e.g. in erythroid cells) or the plasma membrane (e.g. in intestine).	eng	59	69	The Biochemical journal	403	1	2007	Apr	01	D000818;D027682/Q000737;D027682/Q000235;D027682/Q000378;D002413/Q000378;D018076/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D007700;D009865/Q000502;D018408;D014176;D020033/Q000737;D020033/Q000235;D020033/Q000378;D011994/Q000378;D012044;D013379;D014158;D014162;D014982	Animals;Cation Transport Proteins/chemistry;Cation Transport Proteins/genetics;Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism;Cations, Divalent/metabolism;DNA, Complementary/metabolism;Female;Humans;Kinetics;Oocytes/physiology;Patch-Clamp Techniques;Protein Biosynthesis;Protein Isoforms/chemistry;Protein Isoforms/genetics;Protein Isoforms/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Regression Analysis;Substrate Specificity;Transcription, Genetic;Transfection;Xenopus laevis	Mackenzie B;Takanaga H;Hubert N;Rolfs A;Hediger MA	Journal, Articles							erythro	True
741	17642512	The effect of heavy atoms on the conformation of the active-site polypeptide loop in human ABO(H) blood-group glycosyltransferase B.	The human ABO(H) blood-group antigens are oligosaccharide structures that are expressed on erythrocyte and other cell surfaces. The terminal carbohydrate residue differs between the blood types and determines the immune reactivity of this antigen. Individuals with blood type A have a terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue and those with blood type B have a terminal galactose residue. The attachment of these terminal carbohydrates are catalyzed by two different glycosyltransferases: an alpha(1-->3)N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GTA) and an alpha(1-->3)galactosyltransferase (GTB) for blood types A and B, respectively. GTA and GTB are homologous enzymes that differ in only four of 354 amino-acid residues (Arg/Gly176, Gly/Ser235, Leu/Met266 and Gly/Ala268 in GTA and GTB, respectively). Diffraction-quality crystals of GTA and GTB have previously been grown from as little as 10 mg ml(-1) stock solutions in the presence of Hg, while diffraction-quality crystals of the native enzymes require much higher concentrations of protein. The structure of a single mutant C209A has been determined in the presence and absence of heavy atoms and reveals that when mercury is complexed with Cys209 it forces a significant level of disorder in a polypeptide loop (amino acids 179-195) that is known to cover the active site of the enzyme. The observation that the more highly disordered structure is more amenable to crystallization is surprising and the derivative provides insight into the mobility of this polypeptide loop compared with homologous enzymes.	eng	860	865	Acta crystallographica.

742	17472574	Identification of protein-ribulosamine-5-phosphatase as human low-molecular-mass protein tyrosine phosphatase-A.	Ribulosamines, which are substrates for the deglycating enzyme fructosamine-3-kinase-related protein, are presumably formed intracellularly through glycation of proteins with ribose 5-phosphate followed by dephosphorylation of resulting RN5Ps (ribulosamine 5-phosphates) by a putative RN5Pase (ribulosamine-5-phosphatase). Ribose 5-phosphate is known to be a potent glycating agent and we show in the present study that it reacts approximately 10 and 80-fold more rapidly with protein than ribose and glucose respectively. We also show that tissue extracts and, most particularly, erythrocyte extracts contain a protein-RN5Pase. We have purified this enzyme from human erythrocytes to near homogeneity and shown it to correspond to LMWPTP-A [low-molecular-mass ('weight') protein tyrosine phosphatase-A]. Human recombinant LMWPTP-A displayed an RN5Pase activity that was higher than its tyrosine phosphatase activity, indicating that this phosphatase may participate in protein deglycation, a new form of protein repair.	eng	139	145	The Biochemical journal	406	1	2007	Aug	15	D000595;D000818;D004912/Q000201;D006031;D006801;D008297;D008969;D008970;D010749/Q000737;D010749/Q000302;D010749/Q000378;D010766;D017853/Q000378;D017027/Q000737;D017027/Q000302;D017027/Q000378;D051381;D017208;D054630;D011956/Q000737;D011956/Q000302;D011956/Q000378;D012267/Q000378;D013379;D014018	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glycosylation;Humans;Male;Molecular Sequence Data;Molecular Weight;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/chemistry;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/isolation & purification;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/chemistry;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/isolation & purification;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 4;Receptors, Cell Surface/chemistry;Receptors, Cell Surface/isolation & purification;Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism;Ribosemonophosphates/metabolism;Substrate Specificity;Tissue Distribution	Fortpied J;Gemayel R;Vertommen D;Van Schaftingen E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
743	18188525	4-pyridone-3-carboxamide ribonucleoside triphosphate accumulating in erythrocytes in end stage renal failure originates from tryptophan metabolism.	We recently identified an erythrocyte nucleotide accumulating in end-stage renal disease as 4-pyridone-3-carboxamide ribonucleotide triphosphate (4PYTP), a nucleotide never described previously. Plasma tryptophan concentration has been previously reported to be reduced in patients in chronic renal failure that is in turn associated with elevated precursors of tryptophan metabolism, including L -kynurenine and quinolinic acid, both of which have been implicated in the neurotoxic manifestations of chronic renal failure. Here we compare mean erythrocyte 4PYTP, and plasma tryptophan concentrations, in controls and four patient groups with renal impairment (10 per group) and confirmed a reduction in plasma tryptophan in patients on dialysis that corrected with renal transplantation. We found: An inverse correlation between plasma tryptophan and red cell 4PYTP concentrations (R(2)=0.44, P<0.001) when all patients were grouped together. Restoration of both tryptophan and 4PYTP concentrations to control values was only achieved following renal transplantation. 4PYTP was absent from erythrocytes in Molybdenum cofactor (MoCF) deficiency implicating aldehyde oxidase/dehydrogenase, a Molybdenum requiring enzyme. High 4PYTP erythrocyte concentrations in adenine or hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyltransferase deficient patients in severe uremia (113 microM and 103 microM), confirmed the lack of involvement of either enzyme in 4PYTP formation. We propose that 4PYTP is formed by a novel route involving the oxidation of the intermediates of NAD turnover from quinolinic acid by aldehyde oxidase.	eng	135	141	Clinical and experimental medicine	7	4	2007	Dec		D002851;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007676/Q000378;D009711/Q000378;D014364/Q000378	Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kidney Failure, Chronic/metabolism;Nucleotides/metabolism;Tryptophan/metabolism	Laurence A;Edbury SM;Marinaki AM;Smolenski RT;Goldsmith DJ;Simmonds HA;Carrey EA	Journal, Articles					10.1007/s10238-007-0137-8		red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
744	17950726	Microcytosis in ank/ank mice and the role of ANKH in promoting erythroid differentiation.	Progressive ankylosis (Ank and the human homolog, ANKH) is a transmembrane protein which regulates transport of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). ank/ank mice with a mutated ank gene, have calcification and bone ankylosis of the affected joints. In the course of studying these mutant mice, we found that they have microcytosis. These mutant mice have lower mean red blood cell volume (MCV) and lower hemoglobin content in red cells (mean corpuscular hemoglobin, MCH) than normal mice. Using quantitative real-time PCR analysis, we showed that Ank was expressed in the E/Meg bipotent precursor, BFU-E, CFU-E, but there was no Ank expression in the hemoglobinizing erythroblasts. Stable ANKH transfectants in K562 cells highly expressed two immature erythroid cell markers, E-cadherin and endoglin. Enhanced Erythropoietin (Epo) expression and downregulation of SHP-1 were detected in these transfectants. Consequently, the autocrine Epo-EpoR signaling pathway was activated, as evidenced by higher p-Tyr JAK2, p-Tyr EpoR and p-Tyr STAT5B in the ANKH transfectants. Our results revealed a novel function of ANKH in the promotion of early erythroid differentiation in K562 cells. We also showed that ank/ank mice have lower serum levels of Epo than the normal littermates, and this is the likely cause of microcytosis in these mutant mice.	eng	4120	4129	Experimental cell research	313	20	2007	Dec	10	D000818;D019898;D002454;D015536;D004705;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D041905/Q000166;D015672/Q000166;D015672/Q000378;D004921/Q000097;D005786;D006801;D007334/Q000378;D020014;D008565/Q000378;D051379;D008817;D028061/Q000235;D028061/Q000378;D053824/Q000235;D053824/Q000378;D017467/Q000378;D014162	Animals;Autocrine Communication;Cell Differentiation;Down-Regulation;Endocytosis;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythroid Cells/cytology;Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology;Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism;Erythropoietin/blood;Gene Expression Regulation;Humans;Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism;K562 Cells;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Mice;Mice, Mutant Strains;Phosphate Transport Proteins/genetics;Phosphate Transport Proteins/metabolism;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/genetics;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/metabolism;Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism;Transfection	Wang J;Wang C;Tsui HW;Las Heras F;Cheng EY;Iscove NN;Chiu B;Inman RD;Pritzker KP;Tsui FW	Journal, Articles							Erythro;Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;red cell	True
745	17164127	Erythrocyte-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids.	Red blood cells (RBCs) are reservoirs for cis- and trans-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) that can be released. The sources of EET release from RBCs include direct synthesis from arachidonic acid, peroxidation of phospholipids and EETs esterified into cellular phospholipids. The release of EETs from RBCs can be through cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2), secretory PLA2 and other responses associated with ATP release from RBCs. The erythrocyte ATP, purinergic receptors, ATP-binding cassette transporters, PLA2 and cytoskeleton rearrangement may all participate in EET release in the microcirculatory deformation of RBCs. EETs are vasodilatory and are candidate endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors. Due to the anti-hypertensive, fibrinolytic, and anti-thrombotic properties of EETs, their release from RBCs is replete with implications for the control of circulation and rheological characteristics of the circulating blood.	eng	4	10	Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators	82	1-4	2007	Jan		D015126/Q000031;D015126/Q000097;D000255/Q000097;D000818;D016718/Q000097;D004852/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D008833/Q000502;D010741/Q000378;D054467;D018048/Q000502;D058486	8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic Acid/analogs & derivatives;8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic Acid/blood;Adenosine Triphosphate/blood;Animals;Arachidonic Acid/blood;Epoxy Compounds/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Microcirculation/physiology;Phospholipases A/metabolism;Phospholipases A2;Receptors, Purinergic P2/physiology;Receptors, Purinergic P2X7	Jiang H	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;Red blood cell	True
746	17404032	SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase in human erythrocytes.	SHP-1 is a SH2-domain containing protein Tyr-phosphatase expressed in hematopoietic cell lines, which is hypothesized to play a negative role in signal transduction. In human erythrocytes, the phospho-Tyr level of proteins, mainly transmembrane band 3, is closely controlled by the antithetic activity of Tyr-protein kinases and phosphatases, resulting in a dephosphorylated state. Only after particular stimuli, as with oxidizing agents, diamide or pervanadate, or thiol alkylating compound, N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), Tyr-phosphorylation of band 3 can be triggered, inhibiting Tyr-phosphatase action and inducing erythrocyte membrane reorganization. We demonstrate that, in human erythrocytes, SHP-1 is present in membranes from resting cells, but in 5% of the protein amount. Interestingly, this amount increases up to threefold following NEM treatment of intact cells, whereas diamide and pervanadate do not alter the normal protein location. In addition, SHP-1 translocation from cytosol to membrane is not affected by band 3 P-Tyr level, because it is not mediated by the SH2-P-Tyr recruitment mechanism, and localizes into the cytoskeletal compartment. Band 3 is the target of SHP-1, which dephosphorylates Tyr 8, 21, and 904. These findings support the idea that, in human erythrocytes, the normal level of Tyr-phosphorylation of membrane protein, mainly band 3, must be downregulated. We hypothesize that the presence of both SHP-2 and SHP-1 ensures band 3 dephosphorylation in different conditions: SHP-2, through interaction of its SH2 domain/s to P-Tyr protein, is regulated by the band 3 Tyr-phosphorylation level; SHP-1 may be involved by simple membrane rearrangement.	eng	193	203	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences	1095		2007	Jan		D001457/Q000378;D002478;D003600/Q000201;D004910/Q000201;D006801;D021381/Q000502;D053824/Q000097;D053824/Q000502	Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Cells, Cultured;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Humans;Protein Transport/physiology;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/blood;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/physiology	Bragadin M;Ion-Popa F;Clari G;Bordin L	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
747	17576926	Toward a unifying model of malaria-induced channel activity.	Infection of RBC by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum activates, at the trophozoite stage, a membrane current 100- to 150-fold larger than in uninfected RBC. This current is carried by small anion channels initially described in supraphysiological ion concentrations (1.115 M Cl(-)) and named plasmodial surface anion channels (PSAC), suggesting their plasmodial origin. Our results obtained with physiological ion concentrations (0.145 M Cl(-)) support the notion that the parasite-induced channels represent enhanced activity versions of anion channels already present in uninfected RBCs. Among them, an 18-pS inwardly rectifying anion channel (IRC) and a 4- to 5-pS small conductance anion channel (SCC) were present in most single-channel recordings of infected membranes. The aim of this study was to clarify disparities in the reported electrophysiological data and to investigate possible technical reasons why these discrepancies have arisen. We demonstrate that PSAC is the supraphysiological correlate of the SCC and is inhibited by Zn(2+), suggesting that it is a ClC-2 channel. We show that in physiological solutions 80% of the membrane conductance in infected cells can be accounted for by IRC and 20% can be accounted for by SCC whereas in supraphysiological conditions the membrane conductance is almost exclusively carried by SCC (PSAC) because the IRC is functionally turned off.	eng	11044	11049	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	104	26	2007	Jun	26	D000818;D002462/Q000502;D002478;D018118/Q000378;D004553;D004594;D004912/Q000469;D004912/Q000473;D006801;D007473/Q000378;D007473/Q000503;D008288/Q000503;D008954;D010963/Q000472	Animals;Cell Membrane/physiology;Cells, Cultured;Chloride Channels/metabolism;Electric Conductivity;Electrophysiology;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Erythrocytes/pathology;Humans;Ion Channels/metabolism;Ion Channels/physiopathology;Malaria/physiopathology;Models, Biological;Plasmodium falciparum/pathogenicity	Bouyer G;Egée S;Thomas SL	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte	True
748	17175089	Identification of 3-deoxyglucosone dehydrogenase as aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1).	One of the metabolic fates of 3-deoxyglucosone, a product of protein deglycation and a potent glycating agent, is to be oxidized to 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, but the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is presently unknown. Starting from human erythrocytes, which are known to convert 3-deoxyglucosone to 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, we have purified to near homogeneity a NAD-dependent dehydrogenase that catalyzes this last reaction at neutral pH. Sequencing of a 55 kDa band co-eluting with the enzymatic activity in the last step indicated that it corresponded to aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1), an enzyme known to catalyze the oxidation of retinaldehyde to retinoic acid. Overexpression of human ALDH1A1 in HEK cells led to a more than 20-fold increase in 3-deoxyglucosone dehydrogenase activity. In mouse tissues 3-deoxyglucosone dehydrogenase activity was highest in liver, intermediate in lung and testis, and negligible or undetectable in other tissues, in agreement with the tissue distribution of ALDH1A1 mRNA. 3-deoxyglucosone dehydrogenase activity was undetectable in tissues from ALDH1A1(-/-) mice. ALDH1A1 appears therefore to be the major if not the only enzyme responsible for the oxidation of 3-deoxyglucosone to 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate. The urinary excretion of 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate amounted to 16.7 micromol/g creatinine in humans, indicating that 3-deoxyglucosone may be quantitatively a more important substrate than retinaldehyde for ALDH1A1.	eng	369	373	Biochimie	89	3	2007	Mar		D000328;D000444/Q000737;D000444/Q000235;D000444/Q000378;D000080924;D000445/Q000737;D000445/Q000235;D000445/Q000378;D000595;D000818;D002460;D003847/Q000031;D003847/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D015971;D005942/Q000378;D005942/Q000652;D006801;D006863;D008099/Q000201;D008099/Q000378;D008168/Q000201;D008168/Q000378;D008297;D051379;D008815;D018345;D008875;D008969;D008970;D012333/Q000235;D012333/Q000378;D050697;D012172/Q000378;D013379;D013737/Q000201	Adult;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/chemistry;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/genetics;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/metabolism;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/chemistry;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/genetics;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Cell Line;Deoxyglucose/analogs & derivatives;Deoxyglucose/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic;Gluconates/metabolism;Gluconates/urine;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Liver/enzymology;Liver/metabolism;Lung/enzymology;Lung/metabolism;Male;Mice;Mice, Inbred Strains;Mice, Knockout;Middle Aged;Molecular Sequence Data;Molecular Weight;RNA, Messenger/genetics;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Retinal Dehydrogenase;Retinaldehyde/metabolism;Substrate Specificity;Testis/enzymology	Collard F;Vertommen D;Fortpied J;Duester G;Van Schaftingen E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
749	17489100	Simulation study of methemoglobin reduction in erythrocytes. Differential contributions of two pathways to tolerance to oxidative stress.	Methemoglobin (metHb), an oxidized form of hemoglobin, is unable to bind and carry oxygen. Erythrocytes are continuously subjected to oxidative stress and nitrite exposure, which results in the spontaneous formation of metHb. To avoid the accumulation of metHb, reductive pathways mediated by cytochrome b5 or flavin, coupled with NADH-dependent or NADPH-dependent metHb reductases, respectively, keep the level of metHb in erythrocytes at less than 1% of the total hemoglobin under normal conditions. In this work, a mathematical model has been developed to quantitatively assess the relative contributions of the two major metHb-reducing pathways, taking into consideration the supply of NADH and NADPH from central energy metabolism. The results of the simulation experiments suggest that these pathways have different roles in the reduction of metHb; one has a high response rate to hemoglobin oxidation with a limited reducing flux, and the other has a low response rate with a high capacity flux. On the basis of the results of our model, under normal oxidative conditions, the NADPH-dependent system, the physiological role of which to date has been unclear, is predicted to be responsible for most of the reduction of metHb. In contrast, the cytochrome b5-NADH pathway becomes dominant under conditions of excess metHb accumulation, only after the capacity of the flavin-NADPH pathway has reached its limit. We discuss the potential implications of a system designed with two metHb-reducing pathways in human erythrocytes.	eng	1449	1458	The FEBS journal	274	6	2007	Mar		D000222;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D008706/Q000378;D010084;D018384	Adaptation, Physiological;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Methemoglobin/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress	Kinoshita A;Nakayama Y;Kitayama T;Tomita M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
750	17105810	Peroxiredoxin 2 functions as a noncatalytic scavenger of low-level hydrogen peroxide in the erythrocyte.	Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2), a thiol-dependent peroxidase, is the third most abundant protein in the erythrocyte, and its absence in knock-out mice gives rise to hemolytic anemia. We have found that in human erythrocytes, Prx2 was extremely sensitive to oxidation by H(2)O(2), as dimerization was observed after exposure of 5 x 10(6) cells/mL to 0.5 muM H(2)O(2). In contrast to Prx2 in Jurkat T lymphocytes, Prx2 was resistant to overoxidation (oxidation of the cysteine thiol to a sulfinic/sulfonic acid) in erythrocytes. Reduction of dimerized Prx2 in the erythrocyte occurred very slowly, with reversal occurring gradually over a 20-minute period. Very low thioredoxin reductase activity was detected in hemolysates. We postulate that this limits the rate of Prx2 regeneration, and this inefficiency in recycling prevents the overoxidation of Prx2. We also found that Prx2 was oxidized by endogenously generated H(2)O(2), which was mainly derived from hemoglobin autoxidation. Our results demonstrate that in the erythrocyte Prx2 is extremely efficient at scavenging H(2)O(2) noncatalytically. Although it does not act as a classical antioxidant enzyme, its high concentration and substrate sensitivity enable it to handle low H(2)O(2) concentrations efficiently. These unique redox properties may account for its nonredundant role in erythrocyte defense against oxidative stress.	eng	2611	2617	Blood	109	6	2007	Mar	15	D002384;D002460;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D006360/Q000378;D006801;D006861/Q000494;D010084;D010544/Q000378;D054464;D012680;D013880/Q000378	Catalysis;Cell Line;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology;Oxidation-Reduction;Peroxidases/metabolism;Peroxiredoxins;Sensitivity and Specificity;Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/metabolism	Low FM;Hampton MB;Peskin AV;Winterbourn CC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
751	17804405	Molecular identification of mammalian phosphopentomutase and glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase, two members of the alpha-D-phosphohexomutase family.	The molecular identity of mammalian phosphopentomutase has not yet been established unequivocally. That of glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase, the enzyme that synthesizes a cofactor for phosphomutases and putative regulator of glycolysis, is completely unknown. In the present work, we have purified phosphopentomutase from human erythrocytes and found it to copurify with a 68-kDa polypeptide that was identified by mass spectrometry as phosphoglucomutase 2 (PGM2), a protein of the alpha-d-phosphohexomutase family and sharing about 20% identity with mammalian phosphoglucomutase 1. Data base searches indicated that vertebrate genomes contained, in addition to PGM2, a homologue (PGM2L1, for PGM2-like 1) sharing about 60% sequence identity with this protein. Both PGM2 and PGM2L1 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and their properties were studied. Using catalytic efficiency as a criterion, PGM2 acted more than 10-fold better as a phosphopentomutase (both on deoxyribose 1-phosphate and on ribose 1-phosphate) than as a phosphoglucomutase. PGM2L1 showed only low (<5%) phosphopentomutase and phosphoglucomutase activities compared with PGM2, but was about 5-20-fold better than the latter enzyme in catalyzing the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent synthesis of glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and other aldose-bisphosphates. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that PGM2L1 was mainly expressed in brain where glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase activity was previously shown to be particularly high. We conclude that mammalian phosphopentomutase and glucose-1,6-bisphosphate synthase correspond to two closely related proteins, PGM2 and PGM2L1, encoded by two genes that separated early in vertebrate evolution.	eng	31844	31851	The Journal of biological chemistry	282	44	2007	Nov	02	D000595;D000818;D004912/Q000201;D019143;D020869;D006801;D008297;D051379;D008969;D009928;D010770/Q000737;D010770/Q000235;D010770/Q000302;D010770/Q000378	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Evolution, Molecular;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Male;Mice;Molecular Sequence Data;Organ Specificity;Phosphotransferases/chemistry;Phosphotransferases/genetics;Phosphotransferases/isolation & purification;Phosphotransferases/metabolism	Maliekal P;Sokolova T;Vertommen D;Veiga-da-Cunha M;Van Schaftingen E	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

753	17663017	Lysophosphatidylcholine hydrolases of human erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and brain: sensitive targets of conserved specificity for organophosphorus delayed neurotoxicants.	Brain neuropathy target esterase (NTE), associated with organophosphorus (OP)-induced delayed neuropathy, has the same OP inhibitor sensitivity and specificity profiles assayed in the classical way (paraoxon-resistant, mipafox-sensitive hydrolysis of phenyl valerate) or with lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) as the substrate. Extending our earlier observation with mice, we now examine human erythrocyte, lymphocyte, and brain LysoPC hydrolases as possible sensitive targets for OP delayed neurotoxicants and insecticides. Inhibitor profiling of human erythrocytes and lymphocytes gave the surprising result of essentially the same pattern as with brain. Human erythrocyte LysoPC hydrolases are highly sensitive to OP delayed neurotoxicants, with in vitro IC50 values of 0.13-85 nM for longer alkyl analogs, and poorly sensitive to the current OP insecticides. In agricultural workers, erythrocyte LysoPC hydrolyzing activities are similar for newborn children and their mothers and do not vary with paraoxonase status but have high intersample variation that limits their use as a biomarker. Mouse erythrocyte LysoPC hydrolase activity is also of low sensitivity in vitro and in vivo to the OP insecticides whereas the delayed neurotoxicant ethyl n-octylphosphonyl fluoride inhibits activity in vivo at 1-3 mg/kg. Overall, inhibition of blood LysoPC hydrolases is as good as inhibition of brain NTE as a predictor of OP inducers of delayed neuropathy. NTE and lysophospholipases (LysoPLAs) both hydrolyze LysoPC, yet they are in distinct enzyme families with no sequence homology and very different catalytic sites. The relative contributions of NTE and LysoPLAs to LysoPC hydrolysis and clearance from erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and brain remain to be defined.	eng	98	104	Toxicology and applied pharmacology	224	1	2007	Oct	01	D000110/Q000097;D000110/Q000378;D000328;D000382/Q000097;D000382/Q000201;D000818;D043303/Q000235;D001921/Q000187;D001921/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D005838;D006801;D066298;D007231;D007306/Q000633;D008214/Q000201;D051379;D009498/Q000633;D009943/Q000633;D011247;D013379	Acetylcholinesterase/blood;Acetylcholinesterase/metabolism;Adult;Agricultural Workers' Diseases/blood;Agricultural Workers' Diseases/enzymology;Animals;Aryldialkylphosphatase/genetics;Brain/drug effects;Brain/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Genotype;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Infant, Newborn;Insecticides/toxicity;Lymphocytes/enzymology;Mice;Neurotoxins/toxicity;Organophosphorus Compounds/toxicity;Pregnancy;Substrate Specificity	Vose SC;Holland NT;Eskenazi B;Casida JE	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
754	18209485	TRPC6 contributes to the Ca(2+) leak of human erythrocytes.	Human erythrocytes express cation channels which contribute to the background leak of Ca(2+), Na(+) and K(+). Excessive activation of these channels upon energy depletion, osmotic shock, Cl(-) depletion, or oxidative stress triggers suicidal death of erythrocytes (eryptosis), characterized by cell-shrinkage and exposure of phosphatidylserine at the cell surface. Eryptotic cells are supposed to be cleared from circulating blood. The present study aimed to identify the cation channels. RT-PCR revealed mRNA encoding the non-selective cation channel TRPC6 in erythroid progenitor cells. Western blotting indicated expression of TRPC6 protein in erythrocytes from man and wildtype mice but not from TRPC6(-/-) mice. According to flow-cytometry, Ca(2+) entry into human ghosts prepared by hemolysis in EGTA-buffered solution containing the Ca(2+) indicator Fluo3/AM was inhibited by the reducing agent dithiothreitol and the erythrocyte cation channel blockers ethylisopropylamiloride and amiloride. Loading of the ghosts with antibodies against TRPC6 or TRPC3/6/7 but neither with antibodies against TRPM2 or TRPC3 nor antibodies pre-adsorbed with the immunizing peptides inhibited ghost Ca(2+) entry. Moreover, free Ca(2+) concentration, cell-shrinkage, and phospholipid scrambling were significantly lower in Cl(-)-depleted TRPC6(-/-) erythrocytes than in wildtype mouse erythrocytes. In conclusion, human and mouse erythrocytes express TRPC6 cation channels which participate in cation leak and Ca(2+)-induced suicidal death.	eng	183	192	Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology	21	1-3	2008			D000818;D002118/Q000378;D003600;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D015672/Q000166;D015672/Q000378;D006801;D015640;D051379;D050052/Q000378;D000074287	Animals;Calcium/metabolism;Cytosol;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology;Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism;Humans;Ion Channel Gating;Mice;TRPC Cation Channels/metabolism;TRPC6 Cation Channel	Foller M;Kasinathan RS;Koka S;Lang C;Shumilina E;Birnbaumer L;Lang F;Huber SM	Journal, Articles					10.1159/000113760		Erythrocyte;Erythro;erythrocyte;erythro	True
755	18243141	Free radical metabolism in human erythrocytes.	As the red cell emerges from the bone marrow, it loses its nucleus, ribosomes, and mitochondria and therefore all capacity for protein synthesis. However, because of the high O(2) tension in arterial blood and heme Fe content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously produced within red cells. Erythrocytes transport large amount of oxygen over their lifespan resulting in oxidative stress. Various factors can lead to the generation of oxidizing radicals such as O(2)(-), H(2)O(2), HO in erythrocytes. Evidence indicates that many physiological and pathological conditions such as aging, inflammation, eryptosis develop through ROS action. As such, red cells have potent antioxidant protection consisting of enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways that modify highly ROS into substantially less reactive intermediates. The object of this review is to shed light on the role of ROS both at physiological and pathological levels and the structural requirements of antioxidants for appreciable radical-scavenging activity. Obviously, much is still to be discovered before we clearly understand mechanisms of free radical systems in erythrocytes. Ongoing trends in the field are recognition of undetermined oxidant/antioxidant interactions and elucidation of important signaling networks in radical metabolism.	eng	1	11	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	390	1-2	2008	Apr		D000975/Q000378;D017209;D005609/Q000097;D006801;D018384;D017382/Q000378	Antioxidants/metabolism;Apoptosis;Free Radicals/blood;Humans;Oxidative Stress;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism	Cimen MY	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.cca.2007.12.025		red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
756	18413611	Dephosphorylation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate by MIPP expands the regulatory capacity of the Rapoport-Luebering glycolytic shunt.	The Rapoport-Luebering glycolytic bypass comprises evolutionarily conserved reactions that generate and dephosphorylate 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). For >30 years, these reactions have been considered the responsibility of a single enzyme, the 2,3-BPG synthase/2-phosphatase (BPGM). Here, we show that Dictyostelium, birds, and mammals contain an additional 2,3-BPG phosphatase that, unlike BPGM, removes the 3-phosphate. This discovery reveals that the glycolytic pathway can bypass the formation of 3-phosphoglycerate, which is a precursor for serine biosynthesis and an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase. Our 2,3-BPG phosphatase activity is encoded by the previously identified gene for multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (MIPP1), which we now show to have dual substrate specificity. By genetically manipulating Mipp1 expression in Dictyostelium, we demonstrated that this enzyme provides physiologically relevant regulation of cellular 2,3-BPG content. Mammalian erythrocytes possess the highest content of 2,3-BPG, which controls oxygen binding to hemoglobin. We determined that total MIPP1 activity in erythrocytes at 37 degrees C is 0.6 mmol 2,3-BPG hydrolyzed per liter of cells per h, matching previously published estimates of the phosphatase activity of BPGM. MIPP1 is active at 4 degrees C, revealing a clinically significant contribution to 2,3-BPG loss during the storage of erythrocytes for transfusion. Hydrolysis of 2,3-BPG by human MIPP1 is sensitive to physiologic alkalosis; activity decreases 50% when pH rises from 7.0 to 7.4. This phenomenon provides a homeostatic mechanism for elevating 2,3-BPG levels, thereby enhancing oxygen release to tissues. Our data indicate greater biological significance of the Rapoport-Luebering shunt than previously considered.	eng	5998	6003	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	105	16	2008	Apr	22	D019794/Q000032;D019794/Q000737;D019794/Q000378;D000471;D000595;D000818;D001717;D004023/Q000201;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D019143;D006019;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D006868;D008969;D010100/Q000378;D010744/Q000737;D010744/Q000378;D010766;D015800/Q000737;D051381	2,3-Diphosphoglycerate/analysis;2,3-Diphosphoglycerate/chemistry;2,3-Diphosphoglycerate/metabolism;Alkalosis;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Birds;Dictyostelium/enzymology;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Evolution, Molecular;Glycolysis;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Hydrolysis;Molecular Sequence Data;Oxygen/metabolism;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/chemistry;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism;Phosphorylation;Protozoan Proteins/chemistry;Rats	Cho J;King JS;Qian X;Harwood AJ;Shears SB	Journal, Articles					10.1073/pnas.0710980105		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
757	18508966	Characterization of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger NHA2.	Cation/proton exchange has been recognized for decades in mammalian mitochondria, but the exchanger proteins have eluded identification. In this study, a cDNA from a human brain library, previously designated NHA2 in the genome, was cloned and characterized. The NHA2 transcript bears more similarity to prokaryotic than known eukaryotic sodium/proton exchangers, but it was found to be expressed in multiple mammalian organs and cultured cells. A mAb to NHA2 was generated and found to label an approximately 55-kD native protein in multiple tissues and cell lines. The specificity of this antibody was confirmed by demonstrating the loss of the native NHA2 band on immunoblots when cultured cells were treated with NHA2-specific small interfering RNA. Although NHA2 protein was detected in multiple organs, within each, its expression was restricted to specific cell types. In the kidney, co-localization with calbindin 28k and reverse transcription-PCR of microdissected tubules revealed that NHA2 is limited to the distal convoluted tubule. In cell lines, native NHA2 was localized both to the plasma membrane and to the intracellular compartment; immunogold electron microscopy of rat distal convoluted tubule demonstrated NHA2 predominantly but not exclusively on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, co-sedimentation of NHA2 antigen and mitochondrial membranes was observed with differential centrifugation, and two mitochondrial markers co-localized with NHA2 in cultured cells. Regarding function, human NHA2 reversed the sodium/hydrogen exchanger-null phenotype when expressed in sodium/hydrogen exchanger-deficient yeast and restored the ability to defend high salinity in the presence of acidic extracellular pH. In summary, NHA2 is a ubiquitous mammalian sodium proton/exchanger that is restricted to the distal convoluted tubule in the kidney.	eng	1547	1556	Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN	19	8	2008	Aug		D000595;D017920/Q000378;D002462/Q000378;D006801;D042541/Q000378;D007686/Q000378;D008969;D014018	Amino Acid Sequence;Antiporters/metabolism;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Intracellular Space/metabolism;Kidney Tubules, Distal/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Tissue Distribution	Fuster DG;Zhang J;Shi M;Bobulescu IA;Andersson S;Moe OW	Journal, Articles					10.1681/ASN.2007111245		red cell	True
758	18586889	Phosphodiesterase 3 is present in rabbit and human erythrocytes and its inhibition potentiates iloprost-induced increases in cAMP.	Increases in the second messenger cAMP are associated with receptor-mediated ATP release from erythrocytes. In other signaling pathways, cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyze this second messenger and thereby limit its biological actions. Although rabbit and human erythrocytes possess adenylyl cyclase and synthesize cAMP, their PDE activity is poorly characterized. It was reported previously that the prostacyclin analog iloprost stimulated receptor-mediated increases in cAMP in rabbit and human erythrocytes. However, the PDEs that hydrolyze erythrocyte cAMP synthesized in response to iloprost were not identified. PDE3 inhibitors were reported to augment increases in cAMP stimulated by prostacyclin analogs in platelets and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Additionally, PDE3 activity was identified in embryonic avian erythrocytes, but the presence of this PDE in mammalian erythrocytes has not been investigated. Here, using Western blot analysis, we determined that PDE3B is a component of rabbit and human erythrocyte membranes. In addition, we report that the preincubation of rabbit and human erythrocytes with the PDE3 inhibitors milrinone and cilostazol potentiates iloprost-induced increases in cAMP. In addition, cilostamide, the parent compound of cilostazol, potentiated iloprost-induced increases in cAMP in human erythrocytes. These findings demonstrate that PDE3B is present in rabbit and human erythrocytes and are consistent with the hypothesis that PDE3 activity regulates cAMP levels associated with a signaling pathway activated by iloprost in these cells.	eng	H786	H793	American journal of physiology.

759	17959747	ATP-dependent transport of leukotrienes B4 and C4 by the multidrug resistance protein ABCC4 (MRP4).	The proinflammatory mediators leukotriene (LT) B(4) and LTC(4) must be transported out of cells before they can interact with LT receptors. Previously, we identified the multidrug resistance protein ABCC1 (MRP1) as an efflux pump for LTC(4). However, the molecular basis for the efflux of LTB(4) was unknown. Here, we demonstrate that human ABCC4 mediates the ATP-dependent efflux of LTB(4) in the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH), whereby the latter can be replaced by S-methyl GSH. Transport studies were performed with inside-out membrane vesicles from V79 fibroblasts and Sf9 insect cells that contained recombinant ABCC4, with vesicles from human platelets and myelomonocytic U937 cells, which were rich in endogenous ABCC4, but ABCC1 was below detectability. Moreover, human polymorphonuclear leukocytes contained ABCC4. K(m) values for LTB(4) were 5.2 muM with vesicles from fibroblasts and 5.6 muM with vesicles from platelets. ABCC4, with its broad substrate specificity, also functioned as an ATP-dependent efflux pump for LTC(4) with a K(m) of 0.13 muM in vesicles from fibroblasts and 0.32 muM in vesicles from platelets. However, GSH was not required for the transport of this glutathionylated leukotriene. The transport of LTC(4) by ABCC4 explains its release from platelets during transcellular synthesis. ATP-dependent transport of LTB(4) and LTC(4) by ABCC4 was inhibited by several organic anions, including S-decyl GSH, sulindac sulfide, and by the LTD(4) receptor antagonists montelukast and 3-(((3-(2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyl)phenyl)-((3-dimethyl-amino-3-oxopropyl)-thio)-methyl)thio)propanoic acid (MK571). Thus, as an efflux pump for the proinflammatory mediators LTB(4) and LTC(4), ABCC4 may represent a novel target for anti-inflammatory therapies.	eng	86	94	The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics	324	1	2008	Jan		D000255/Q000378;D000818;D001792/Q000378;D002460;D002462/Q000378;D002478;D006224;D003412;D004912/Q000378;D005978/Q000494;D006801;D007963/Q000378;D007975/Q000378;D017997/Q000378;D027425/Q000235;D027425/Q000378;D009504/Q000378;D011994/Q000378;D022161/Q000378	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Animals;Blood Platelets/metabolism;Cell Line;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Cells, Cultured;Cricetinae;Cricetulus;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glutathione/pharmacology;Humans;Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism;Leukotriene B4/metabolism;Leukotriene C4/metabolism;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism;Neutrophils/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Transport Vesicles/metabolism	Rius M;Hummel-Eisenbeiss J;Keppler D	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte	True
760	18156367	Mammalian acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase enzymes.	The mammalian RBC lacks de novo lipid synthesis but maintains its membrane composition by rapid turnover of acyl moieties at the sn-2 position of phospholipids. Plasma-derived fatty acids are esterified to acyl-CoA by acyl-CoA synthetases and transferred to lysophospholipids by acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases. We report the characterization of three lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) acyltransferases (LPCATs), products of the AYTL1, -2, and -3 genes. These proteins are three members of a LPCAT family, of which all three genes are expressed in an erythroleukemic cell line. Aytl2 mRNA was detected in mouse reticulocytes, and the presence of the product of the human ortholog was confirmed in adult human RBCs. The three murine Aytl proteins generated phosphatidylcholine from long-chain acyl-CoA and lysoPC when expressed in Escherichia coli membranes. Spliced variants of Aytl1, affecting a conserved catalytic motif, were identified. Calcium and magnesium modulated LPCAT activity of both Aytl1 and -2 proteins that exhibit EF-hand motifs at the C terminus. Characterization of the product of the Aytl2 gene as the phosphatidylcholine reacylating enzyme in RBCs represents the identification of a plasma membrane lysophospholipid acyltransferase and establishes the function of a LPCAT protein.	eng	88	93	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	105	1	2008	Jan	08	D008243/Q000235;D008243/Q000502;D000595;D000818;D020134;D045744;D002462/Q000378;D003001;D004912/Q000378;D004926/Q000378;D005227/Q000378;D006801;D051379;D008969;D010713/Q000737;D012156/Q000378;D017386	1-Acylglycerophosphocholine O-Acyltransferase/genetics;1-Acylglycerophosphocholine O-Acyltransferase/physiology;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Catalytic Domain;Cell Line, Tumor;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Cloning, Molecular;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Escherichia coli/metabolism;Fatty Acids/metabolism;Humans;Mice;Molecular Sequence Data;Phosphatidylcholines/chemistry;Reticulocytes/metabolism;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid	Soupene E;Fyrst H;Kuypers FA	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;erythro	True
761	18494517	Highly efficient depletion strategy for the two most abundant erythrocyte soluble proteins improves proteome coverage dramatically.	In-depth human erythrocyte proteome studies are severely hampered by the presence of hemoglobin and carbonic anhydrase-1, which account for more than 98% of the total erythrocyte soluble protein content. We developed a specific depletion approach that resulted in a drastic increase in the number of identified proteins. This depletion technique is valuable for proteome studies of human erythrocyte disorders with unknown etiology and of tissue samples that contain blood.	eng	3060	3063	Journal of proteome research	7	7	2008	Jul		D001798/Q000032;D024401/Q000097;D024401/Q000302;D004912/Q000737;D006454/Q000302;D006801;D020543/Q000032;D012995	Blood Proteins/analysis;Carbonic Anhydrase I/blood;Carbonic Anhydrase I/isolation & purification;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Hemoglobins/isolation & purification;Humans;Proteome/analysis;Solubility	Ringrose JH;van Solinge WW;Mohammed S;O'Flaherty MC;van Wijk R;Heck AJ;Slijper M	Journal, Articles					10.1021/pr8001029		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
762	18600531	Correlation between cytidine deaminase genotype and gemcitabine deamination in blood samples.	Cytidine deaminase (CDA) is the major enzyme of gemcitabine inactivation. The aim of this study was to determine whether the CDA Lys27Gln polymorphism influenced gemcitabine deamination in blood samples from 90 lung cancer patients. The polymorphism was studied with Taqman probes-based assay; CDA activity was evaluated by HPLC in cytoplasmic extracts from red blood cells. Mean enzymatic activity was significantly lower in patients carrying the CDA Lys27Lys than in patients with the Lys27Gln or Gln27Gln protein (P < 0.05). CDA genotyping may be useful in screening patients before gemcitabine treatment, in order to identify subjects with lower CDA activity and potentially better clinical outcomes after gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.	eng	720	725	Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids	27	6	2008	Jun		D000970/Q000097;D000970/Q000378;D003564/Q000235;D003564/Q000378;D003641;D003841/Q000031;D003841/Q000097;D003841/Q000378;D005838;D006801;D011110;D000093542	Antineoplastic Agents/blood;Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism;Cytidine Deaminase/genetics;Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism;Deamination;Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives;Deoxycytidine/blood;Deoxycytidine/metabolism;Genotype;Humans;Polymorphism, Genetic;Gemcitabine	Giovannetti E;Laan AC;Vasile E;Tibaldi C;Nannizzi S;Ricciardi S;Falcone A;Danesi R;Peters GJ	Journal, Articles					10.1080/15257770802145447		red blood cell	True
763	18600548	Metabolism of 4-pyridone-3-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribonucleoside triphosphate and its nucleoside precursor in the erythrocytes.	We recently discovered new nucleotides (4-pyridone-3-carboxamide-1-beta -D-ribonucleoside phosphates) in human erythrocytes. To establish the precursor compound and pathways of nucleotide derivative formation and breakdown, human erythrocytes were incubated for 3 hours with 0.3 mM 4-pyridone-3-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribonucleoside (4PYR) and erythrocyte concentrations of 4PYR and adenine nucleotides were followed. 4PYR triphosphate increased from 16.1 +/- 0.6 micro M to 74.9 +/- 9.17 and 4PYR monophosphate increased from 5 micro M to 254.7 +/- 13.9 micro M. Conversely, incubation with 0.3 mM 4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (4PY) did not lead to additional 4PYR nucleotide formation. 4PYR nucleotides were catabolized to 4PYR. We conclude that 4PYR nucleotides are formed in erythrocytes by nucleoside kinase-mediated 4PYR phosphorylation and catabolized by 5'nucleotidase-mediated dephosphorylation.	eng	830	834	Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids	27	6	2008	Jun		D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007185;D009705/Q000097;D009705/Q000737;D009705/Q000378;D009711/Q000097;D009711/Q000378;D013997	Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Incubators;Nucleosides/blood;Nucleosides/chemistry;Nucleosides/metabolism;Nucleotides/blood;Nucleotides/metabolism;Time Factors	Slominska EM;Orlewska C;Yuen A;Osman L;Romaszko P;Sokolowska E;Foks H;Simmonds HA;Yacoub MH;Smolenski RT	Journal, Articles					10.1080/15257770802146452		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

For a better understanding of the behavior of solid-phase combinatorial peptide ligands for capturing the red blood cell low-abundance soluble proteome, combinatorial peptides of different lengths from a single amino acid up to a hexapeptide were evaluated. A red blood cell lysate (6 g total protein) was loaded in a cascade fashion to the six columns, which were individually eluted with 8 M urea, 2% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (v/w), and 50 mM citric acid. Each eluate was analyzed via sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two-dimensional maps, and nanoLC-MS/MS.	eng	3547	3556	Analytical chemistry	80	10	2008	May	15	D001798/Q000737;D001798/Q000302;D002853/Q000379;D020650;D004591;D004912/Q000737;D009842/Q000737;D019151;D020543;D012680;D053719	Blood Proteins/chemistry;Blood Proteins/isolation & purification;Chromatography, Liquid/methods;Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Oligopeptides/chemistry;Peptide Library;Proteome;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tandem Mass Spectrometry	Simó C;Bachi A;Cattaneo A;Guerrier L;Fortis F;Boschetti E;Podtelejnikov A;Righetti PG	Journal, Articles					10.1021/ac702635v		Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
765	18614565	Extensive analysis of the cytoplasmic proteome of human erythrocytes using the peptide ligand library technology and advanced mass spectrometry.	The erythrocyte cytoplasmic proteome is composed of 98% hemoglobin; the remaining 2% is largely unexplored. Here we used a combinatorial library of hexameric peptides as a capturing agent to lower the signal of hemoglobin and amplify the signal of low to very low abundance proteins in the cytoplasm of human red blood cells (RBCs). Two types of hexapeptide library beads have been adopted: amino-terminal hexapeptide beads and beads in which the peptides have been further derivatized by carboxylation. The amplification of the signal of low abundance and suppression of the signal of high abundance species were fully demonstrated by two-dimensional gel maps and nano-LC-MSMS analysis. The effect of this new methodology on quantitative information also was explored. Moreover using this approach on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer, we could identify with high confidence as many as 1578 proteins in the cytoplasmic fraction of a highly purified preparation of RBCs, allowing a deep exploration of the classical RBC pathways as well as the identification of unexpected minor proteins. In addition, we were able to detect the presence of eight different hemoglobin chains including embryonic and newly discovered globin chains. Thus, this extensive study provides a huge data set of proteins that are present in the RBC cytoplasm that may help to better understand the biology of this simplified cell and may open the way to further studies on blood pathologies using targeted approaches.	eng	2254	2269	Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP	7	11	2008	Nov		D001798/Q000032;D001798/Q000302;D003593/Q000737;D015180;D004912/Q000737;D006801;D019151;D020543/Q000032;D020543/Q000302;D040901;D053719/Q000379	Blood Proteins/analysis;Blood Proteins/isolation & purification;Cytoplasm/chemistry;Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Humans;Peptide Library;Proteome/analysis;Proteome/isolation & purification;Proteomics;Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods	Roux-Dalvai F;Gonzalez de Peredo A;Simó C;Guerrier L;Bouyssié D;Zanella A;Citterio A;Burlet-Schiltz O;Boschetti E;Righetti PG;Monsarrat B	Journal, Articles					10.1074/mcp.M800037-MCP200		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
766	18936201	Zinc transporters ZnT1 (Slc30a1), Zip8 (Slc39a8), and Zip10 (Slc39a10) in mouse red blood cells are differentially regulated during erythroid development and by dietary zinc deficiency.	Zinc is essential for normal erythroid cell functions and therefore intracellular zinc homeostasis during erythroid differentiation is tightly regulated. However, a characterization of zinc transporters in erythrocytes has not been conducted. The membrane fraction of mature mouse RBC was screened for zinc transporter expression using western analysis as a first step in the characterization process. ZnT1, Zip8, and Zip10 were detected among the 12 transporter proteins tested. We examined expression of these zinc transporters during erythropoietin (EPO)-induced differentiation of splenic erythroid progenitor cells into reticulocytes. Both Zip8 and Zip10 mRNA increased by 2-6 h after addition of EPO to the cells. In contrast, maximal RNA levels for the zinc transporter ZnT1 and erythroid delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase were only produced by 24 h after EPO. We confirmed these changes in transcript abundance by western analysis. Dietary zinc status influences zinc-dependent functions of RBC. To determine whether the identified zinc transporters respond to dietary zinc status, mice were fed a zinc-deficient or control diet. Incorporation of (65)Zn into erythrocytes in vitro was significantly increased in cells from the zinc-deficient mice. Western analysis and densitometry revealed that erythrocyte Zip10 was upregulated and ZnT1 was downregulated in the zinc-depleted mice. Zip8 was not affected by restricted zinc intake. Collectively, these data suggest that the zinc transporters ZnT1, Zip8, and Zip10 are important for zinc homeostasis in erythrocytes and that ZnT1 and Zip10 respond to the dietary zinc supply.	eng	2076	2083	The Journal of nutrition	138	11	2008	Nov		D000740/Q000139;D000818;D001693/Q000502;D027682/Q000235;D027682/Q000378;D004032;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D005786/Q000502;D008297;D051379;D015032/Q000172	Anemia/chemically induced;Animals;Biological Transport, Active/physiology;Cation Transport Proteins/genetics;Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism;Diet;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Gene Expression Regulation/physiology;Male;Mice;Zinc/deficiency	Ryu MS;Lichten LA;Liuzzi JP;Cousins RJ	Journal, Articles					10.3945/jn.108.093575		Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;erythrocyte;RBC	True
767	18706436	Cellular function of neuropathy target esterase in lysophosphatidylcholine action.	Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) plays critical roles in embryonic development and maintenance of peripheral axons. It is a secondary target of some organophosphorus toxicants including analogs of insecticides and chemical warfare agents. Although the mechanistic role of NTE in vivo is poorly defined, it is known to hydrolyze lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in vitro and may protect cell membranes from cytotoxic accumulation of LPC. To determine the cellular function of NTE, Neuro-2a and COS-7 cells were transfected with a full-length human NTE-containing plasmid yielding recombinant NTE (rNTE). We find the same inhibitor sensitivity and specificity profiles for rNTE assayed with LPC or phenyl valerate (a standard NTE substrate) and that this correlation extends to the LPC hydrolases of human brain, lymphocytes and erythrocytes. All of these LPC hydrolases are therefore very similar to each other in respect to a conserved inhibitor binding site conformation. NTE is expressed in brain and lymphocytes and contributes to LPC hydrolase activities in these tissues. The enzyme or enzymes responsible for erythrocyte LPC hydrolase activity remain to be identified. We also show that rNTE protects Neuro-2a and COS-7 cells from exogenous LPC cytotoxicity. Expression of rNTE in Neuro-2a cells alters their phospholipid balance (analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with single ion monitoring) by lowering LPC-16:0 and LPC-18:0 and elevating glycerophosphocholine without a change in phosphatidylcholine-16:0/18:1 or 16:0/18:2. NTE therefore serves an important function in LPC homeostasis and action.	eng	376	383	Toxicology and applied pharmacology	232	3	2008	Nov	01	D000818;D001921/Q000201;D019556;D002265/Q000502;D002478;D002522;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008244/Q000378;D008244/Q000494;D010755/Q000633	Animals;Brain/enzymology;COS Cells;Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/physiology;Cells, Cultured;Chlorocebus aethiops;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Lysophosphatidylcholines/metabolism;Lysophosphatidylcholines/pharmacology;Organophosphates/toxicity	Vose SC;Fujioka K;Gulevich AG;Lin AY;Holland NT;Casida JE	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.taap.2008.07.015		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
768	18564357	High expression of the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, PDE9A, in sickle cell disease (SCD) and the effects of its inhibition in erythroid cells and SCD neutrophils.	Modulation of intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) may characterize a therapeutic target for sickle cell disease (SCD); cGMP-dependent signalling may be important for erythroid foetal haemoglobin induction and exert anti-inflammatory functions in leucocytes. As the inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which regulate intracellular cGMP, can result in tissue-specific elevation of cGMP, we studied the gene expressions of cGMP-specific PDEs (-1A, -5A and -9A) in the reticulocytes and neutrophils of healthy controls, steady-state SCD patients and SCD patients on hydroxycarbamide therapy (SCDHC). PDE9A gene expression was found in numerous cell types; however, high expression was found in neutrophils, reticulocytes, CD34(+)-derived erythroid cells and K562 erythroleukaemic cells, indicating a high haematopoietic cell expression. PDE9A gene expression was, however, significantly higher in the reticulocytes and neutrophils of SCD individuals, compared to control cells; Western blotting confirmed the production of PDE9A protein in SCD neutrophils and K562 cells. Inhibition of PDE9A enzyme with the specific inhibitor, BAY73-6691, significantly increased production of the gamma-globin gene (HBG) in K562 cells and reversed the increased adhesive properties of SCD neutrophils. Since elevation of haematopoietic intracellular cGMP may be beneficial in SCD, the relatively limited tissue distribution of PDE9A suggests that it could represent a novel drug target worthy of further study.	eng	836	844	British journal of haematology	142	5	2008	Sep		D015105/Q000037;D015105/Q000378;D015106/Q000037;D015106/Q000378;D000293;D000328;D000755/Q000188;D000755/Q000201;D000986/Q000494;D000986/Q000627;D001938;D016022;D041905/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D006918/Q000494;D006918/Q000627;D008297;D008875;D009504/Q000201;D011720/Q000494;D011743/Q000494;D012156/Q000201;D055545/Q000378	3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/antagonists & inhibitors;3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/metabolism;3',5'-Cyclic-GMP Phosphodiesterases/antagonists & inhibitors;3',5'-Cyclic-GMP Phosphodiesterases/metabolism;Adolescent;Adult;Anemia, Sickle Cell/drug therapy;Anemia, Sickle Cell/enzymology;Antisickling Agents/pharmacology;Antisickling Agents/therapeutic use;Brazil;Case-Control Studies;Erythroid Cells/enzymology;Female;Humans;Hydroxyurea/pharmacology;Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use;Male;Middle Aged;Neutrophils/enzymology;Pyrazoles/pharmacology;Pyrimidines/pharmacology;Reticulocytes/enzymology;gamma-Globins/metabolism	Almeida CB;Traina F;Lanaro C;Canalli AA;Saad ST;Costa FF;Conran N	Journal, Articles					10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07264.x		Erythro;erythro	True
769	19421340	Gene expression analysis of human red blood cells.	Understanding of molecular mechanisms governing the enucleating phenomena of human erythrocytes is of major importance in both fundamental and applied studies. Total RNA (n=7) from human RBCs (purity of erythrocyte preparation >99,99%) was tested using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA), and transcribed to cDNA. Microarray analysis was performed with the Human Genome Focus GeneChip (Affymetrix, USA), containing 8500 transcripts corresponding to 8400 human genes. Here we report that human RBCs contain typical eukaryotic RNA with 28S- and18S-rRNA standard bands. Microarray studies revealed the presence of transcripts of 1019 different genes in erythrocytic RNA. Gene Ontology analysis recognized 859 genes involved in general biological processes: 529 genes for cellular metabolism, 228 genes for signal transduction, 104 genes for development, 107 genes for immune response, 62 genes for protein localization, 53 genes for programmed cell death, and 5 genes for autophagy. A number of genes responsible for transcription, translation, RNA-stabilisation as well as for apoptosis and anti-apoptosis have been identified for the first time in circulating human RBCs. The presented data shed new light on the genetic determination of erythropoiesis, apoptosis and may have implications on the pathophysiology and diagnosis of various diseases involving red blood cells.	eng	156	159	International journal of medical sciences	6	4	2009			D017209/Q000235;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D004920/Q000235;D015870;D020869;D006801;D066298;D020411;D012313/Q000097;D012313/Q000235	Apoptosis/genetics;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythropoiesis/genetics;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;RNA/blood;RNA/genetics	Kabanova S;Kleinbongard P;Volkmer J;Andrée B;Kelm M;Jax TW	Journal, Articles							Erythro;Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;erythrocyte;RBC	True
770	19050047	Regulation of erythrocyte survival by AMP-activated protein kinase.	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy-sensing enzyme, counteracts energy depletion by stimulation of energy production and limitation of energy utilization. On energy depletion, erythrocytes undergo suicidal death or eryptosis, triggered by an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) activity ([Ca(2+)](i)) and characterized by cell shrinkage and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure at the erythrocyte surface. The present study explored whether AMPK participates in the regulation of eryptosis. Western blotting and confocal microscopy disclosed AMPK expression in erythrocytes. [Ca(2+)](i) (Fluo3 fluorescence), cell volume (forward scatter), and PS exposure (annexin V binding) were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Glucose removal increased [Ca(2+)](i), decreased cell volume, and increased PS exposure. The AMPK-inhibitor compound C (20 microM) did not significantly modify eryptosis under glucose-replete conditions but significantly augmented the eryptotic effect of glucose withdrawal. An increase in [Ca(2+)](i) by Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin triggered eryptosis, an effect blunted by the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR; 1 mM). As compared with erythrocytes from wild-type littermates (ampk(+/+)), erythrocytes from AMPKalpha1-deficient mice (ampk(-/-)) were significantly more susceptible to the eryptotic effect of energy depletion. The ampk(-/-) mice were anemic despite excessive reticulocytosis, and they suffered from severe splenomegaly, again pointing to enhanced erythrocyte turnover. The observations disclose a critical role of AMPK in the survival of circulating erythrocytes.	eng	1072	1080	FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology	23	4	2009	Apr		D055372/Q000037;D055372/Q000172;D055372/Q000378;D055372/Q000502;D000620/Q000031;D000620/Q000494;D000818;D017304/Q000378;D002118/Q000378;D048429/Q000187;D003600/Q000187;D003600/Q000378;D004905/Q000187;D004905/Q000502;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000502;D016650/Q000378;D005456/Q000378;D005947/Q000172;D006801;D015759/Q000494;D007476/Q000494;D008297;D051379;D008817;D010718/Q000378;D011720/Q000494;D011743/Q000494;D012265/Q000494	AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors;AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/deficiency;AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism;AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/pharmacology;Animals;Annexin A5/metabolism;Calcium/metabolism;Cell Size/drug effects;Cytosol/drug effects;Cytosol/metabolism;Erythrocyte Aging/drug effects;Erythrocyte Aging/physiology;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/physiology;Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/metabolism;Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism;Glucose/deficiency;Humans;Ionomycin/pharmacology;Ionophores/pharmacology;Male;Mice;Mice, Mutant Strains;Phosphatidylserines/metabolism;Pyrazoles/pharmacology;Pyrimidines/pharmacology;Ribonucleotides/pharmacology	Föller M;Sopjani M;Koka S;Gu S;Mahmud H;Wang K;Floride E;Schleicher E;Schulz E;Münzel T;Lang F	Journal, Articles					10.1096/fj.08-121772		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
771	19061854	The peroxidase and peroxynitrite reductase activity of human erythrocyte peroxiredoxin 2.	Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin extremely abundant in the erythrocyte. The peroxidase activity was studied in a steady-state approach yielding an apparent K(M) of 2.4 microM for human thioredoxin and a very low K(M) for H2O2 (0.7 microM). Rate constants for the reaction of peroxidatic cysteine with the peroxide substrate, H2O2 or peroxynitrite, were determined by competition kinetics, k(2) = 1.0 x 10(8) and 1.4 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1) at 25 degrees C and pH 7.4, respectively. Excess of both oxidants inactivated the enzyme by overoxidation and also tyrosine nitration and dityrosine were observed with peroxynitrite treatment. Prx2 associates into decamers (5 homodimers) and we estimated a dissociation constant K(d) < 10(-23) M(4) which confirms the enzyme exists as a decamer in vivo. Our kinetic results indicate Prx2 is a key antioxidant enzyme for the erythrocyte and reveal red blood cells as active oxidant scrubbers in the bloodstream.	eng	146	154	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics	484	2	2009	Apr	15	D000818;D002384;D002850;D019281;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D006861/Q000097;D006861/Q000378;D007700;D008322;D009249/Q000097;D016877/Q000097;D010084;D010088/Q000097;D010544/Q000097;D054464/Q000097;D054464/Q000737;D054464/Q000302;D013879/Q000097	Animals;Catalysis;Chromatography, Gel;Dimerization;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/blood;Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism;Kinetics;Mammals;NADP/blood;Oxidants/blood;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidoreductases/blood;Peroxidases/blood;Peroxiredoxins/blood;Peroxiredoxins/chemistry;Peroxiredoxins/isolation & purification;Thioredoxins/blood	Manta B;Hugo M;Ortiz C;Ferrer-Sueta G;Trujillo M;Denicola A	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.abb.2008.11.017		Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
772	18783254	The new chemical biology of nitrite reactions with hemoglobin: R-state catalysis, oxidative denitrosylation, and nitrite reductase/anhydrase.	Because of their critical biological roles, hemoglobin and myoglobin are among the most extensively studied proteins in human history, while nitrite tops the list of most-studied small molecules. And although the reactions between them have been examined for more than 140 years, a series of unusual and critical allosterically modulated reactions have only recently been characterized. In this Account, we review three novel metal- and nitrite-catalyzed reaction pathways in the context of historical studies of nitrite and hemoglobin chemistry and attempt to place them in the biological framework of hypoxic signaling. Haldane first described the reaction between nitrite and deoxymyoglobin, forming iron-nitrosylated myoglobin, in his analysis of the meat-curing process more than a century ago. The reaction of nitrous acid with deoxyhemoglobin to form nitric oxide (NO) and methemoglobin was more fully characterized by Brooks in 1937, while the mechanism and unusual behavior of this reaction were further detailed by Doyle and colleagues in 1981. During the past decade, multiple physiological studies have surprisingly revealed that nitrite represents a biological reservoir of NO that can regulate hypoxic vasodilation, cellular respiration, and signaling. Importantly, chemical analysis of this new biology suggests a vital role for deoxyhemoglobin- and deoxymyoglobin-dependent nitrite reduction in these processes. The use of UV-vis deconvolution and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, in addition to refined gas-phase chemiluminescent NO detection, has led to the discovery of three novel and unexpected chemistries between nitrite and deoxyhemoglobin that may contribute to and facilitate hypoxic NO generation and signaling. First, R-state, or allosteric, autocatalysis of nitrite reduction increases the rate of NO generation by deoxyhemoglobin and results in maximal NO production at approximately 50% hemoglobin oxygen saturation, which is physiologically associated with greatest NO-dependent vasodilation. Second, oxidative denitrosylation of the iron-nitrosyl product formed in the deoxyhemoglobin-nitrite reaction allows for NO formation and release in a partially oxygenated environment. Finally, the deoxyhemoglobin-nitrite reaction participates in a nitrite reductase/anhydrase redox cycle that catalyzes the anaerobic conversion of two molecules of nitrite into dinitrogen trioxide (N(2)O(3)). N(2)O(3) may then nitrosate proteins, diffuse across hydrophobic erythrocyte membrane channels such as aquaphorin or Rh, or reconstitute NO via homolysis to NO and NO(2)(*). Importantly, the nitrite reductase/anhydrase redox pathway also represents a novel mechanism of both anaerobic and metal-catalyzed N(2)O(3) formation and S-nitrosation and may thus play a vital role in NO-dependent signaling in a hypoxic and heme-rich environment. We consider how these reactions may contribute to physiological and pathological hypoxic signaling.	eng	157	167	Accounts of chemical research	42	1	2009	Jan	20	D000494;D002384;D006454/Q000737;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D008706/Q000737;D008706/Q000378;D009572/Q000737;D009572/Q000378;D009573/Q000737;D009573/Q000378;D010084;D010100/Q000737;D011487;D026361/Q000737;D026361/Q000378	Allosteric Regulation;Catalysis;Hemoglobins/chemistry;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Methemoglobin/chemistry;Methemoglobin/metabolism;Nitrite Reductases/chemistry;Nitrite Reductases/metabolism;Nitrites/chemistry;Nitrites/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxygen/chemistry;Protein Conformation;Reactive Nitrogen Species/chemistry;Reactive Nitrogen Species/metabolism	Gladwin MT;Grubina R;Doyle MP	Journal, Articles					10.1021/ar800089j		erythrocyte	True
773	19225107	Alpha-hemolysin from Escherichia coli uses endogenous amplification through P2X receptor activation to induce hemolysis.	Escherichia coli is the dominant facultative bacterium in the normal intestinal flora. E. coli is, however, also responsible for the majority of serious extraintestinal infections. There are distinct serotypical differences between facultative and invasive E. coli strains. Invasive strains frequently produce virulence factors such as alpha-hemolysin (HlyA), which causes hemolysis by forming pores in the erythrocyte membrane. The present study reveals that this pore formation triggers purinergic receptor activation to mediate the full hemolytic action. Non-selective ATP-receptor (P2) antagonists (PPADS, suramin) and ATP scavengers (apyrase, hexokinase) concentration dependently inhibited HlyA-induced lysis of equine, murine, and human erythrocytes. The pattern of responsiveness to more selective P2-antagonists implies that both P2X(1) and P2X(7) receptors are involved in HlyA-induced hemolysis in all three species. In addition, our results also propose a role for the pore protein pannexin1 in HlyA-induced hemolysis, as non-selective inhibitors of this channel significantly reduced hemolysis in the three species. In conclusion, activation of P2X receptors and possibly also pannexins augment hemolysis induced by the bacterial toxin, HlyA. These findings potentially have clinical perspectives as P2 antagonists may ameliorate symptoms during sepsis with hemolytic bacteria.	eng	4030	4035	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	106	10	2009	Mar	10	D000251/Q000494;D000818;D017630/Q000037;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000187;D004926/Q000187;D004926/Q000254;D029968/Q000494;D006460/Q000494;D006461/Q000187;D006736;D006801;D051379;D058919;D018048/Q000378;D058469	Adenosine Triphosphatases/pharmacology;Animals;Connexins/antagonists & inhibitors;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Escherichia coli/drug effects;Escherichia coli/growth & development;Escherichia coli Proteins/pharmacology;Hemolysin Proteins/pharmacology;Hemolysis/drug effects;Horses;Humans;Mice;Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists;Receptors, Purinergic P2/metabolism;Receptors, Purinergic P2X	Skals M;Jorgensen NR;Leipziger J;Praetorius HA	Journal, Articles					10.1073/pnas.0807044106		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
774	19252089	Iloprost- and isoproterenol-induced increases in cAMP are regulated by different phosphodiesterases in erythrocytes of both rabbits and humans.	Activation of the G protein G(s) results in increases in cAMP, a necessary step in the pathway for ATP release from rabbit and human erythrocytes. In all cells, the level of cAMP is the product of its synthesis by adenylyl cyclase and its hydrolysis by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Both iloprost (Ilo), a PGI(2) analog, and isoproterenol (Iso), a beta-agonist, stimulate receptor-mediated increases in cAMP in rabbit and human erythrocytes. However, the specific PDEs associated with each of these signaling pathways in the erythrocyte have not been fully characterized. Previously, we reported that PDE3B is present in rabbit and human erythrocyte membranes and that PDE3 inhibitors potentiate Ilo-induced increases in cAMP. Here we report that inhibitors of either PDE2 or PDE4, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA) and rolipram, respectively, potentiate Iso-induced increases in cAMP in rabbit and human erythrocytes. Importantly, these inhibitors had no effect on cAMP increases associated with the incubation of erythrocytes with Ilo. In addition, we establish, for the first time, the presence of PDE2A protein in rabbit and human erythrocyte membranes. Finally, we determined that preincubation of human erythrocytes with EHNA and rolipram together potentiate Iso-induced ATP release, whereas preincubation with cilostazol enhances Ilo-induced release of ATP. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in rabbit and human erythrocytes, Ilo-induced increases in cAMP and ATP release are regulated by PDE3, whereas those associated with Iso are regulated by the activities of both PDE2 and PDE4. These studies demonstrate that PDE activity in these cells is localized to specific signaling pathways.	eng	H1617	H1624	American journal of physiology.

775	19430704	Immunoaffinity purification and characterization of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes.	A new procedure utilizing immunoaffinity column chromatography has been used for the purification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, EC 1.2.1.12) from human erythrocytes. The comparison between this rapid method (one step) and the traditional procedure including ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by Blue Sepharose CL-6B chromatography shows that the new method gives a highest specific activity with a highest yield in a short time. The characterization of the purified GAPDH reveals that the native enzyme is a homotetramer of ~150 kDa with an absolute specificity for the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)). Western blot analysis using purified monospecific polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified GAPDH showed a single 36 kDa band corresponding to the enzyme subunit. Studies on the effect of temperature and pH on enzyme activity revealed optimal values of about 43 degrees C and 8.5, respectively. The kinetic parameters were also calculated: the Vmax was 4.3 U/mg and the Km values against G3P and NAD(+) were 20.7 and 17.8 muM, respectively. The new protocol described represents a simple, economic, and reproducible tool for the purification of GAPDH and can be used for other proteins.	eng	399	406	Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica	41	5	2009	May		D000911/Q000276;D000918;D015153;D002846/Q000379;D004591;D004795;D004912/Q000201;D005987/Q000276;D005987/Q000302;D005987/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D007700;D008970;D015203;D013696	Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology;Antibody Specificity;Blotting, Western;Chromatography, Affinity/methods;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Enzyme Stability;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/immunology;Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/isolation & purification;Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Molecular Weight;Reproducibility of Results;Temperature	Mountassif D;Baibai T;Fourrat L;Moutaouakkil A;Iddar A;El Kebbaj MS;Soukri A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
776	19562367	Arginine transport in human erythroid cells: discrimination of CAT1 and 4F2hc/y+LAT2 roles.	Since arginine metabolites, such as nitric oxide and polyamines, influence the expression of genes involved in erythroid differentiation, the transport of the cationic amino acid may play an important role in erythroid cells. However, available data only concern the presence in these cells of CAT1 transporter (system y(+)), while no information exists on the role of the heterodimeric transporters of system y(+)L (4F2hc/y(+)LAT1 and 4F2hc/y(+)LAT2) which operates transmembrane arginine fluxes cis-inhibited by neutral amino acids in the presence of sodium. Using erythroleukemia K562 cells and normal erythroid precursors, we demonstrate here that arginine transport in human erythroid cells is due to the additive contributions of a leucine-sensitive and leucine-insensitive component. In both cell types, leucine inhibition of arginine influx is much less evident in the absence of sodium, a hallmark of system y(+)L. In K562 cells, N-ethylmaleimide, a known inhibitor of CAT transporters (system y(+)), suppresses only a fraction of arginine influx corresponding to leucine-insensitive uptake. Moreover, in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing 4F2hc and y(+)LAT2, leucine exerts a marked inhibition of arginine transport, partially dependent on sodium, while no inhibition is seen in oocytes expressing CAT1. Lastly, silencing of SLC7A6, the gene for y(+)LAT2, lowers arginine transport and doubles the intracellular content of the cationic amino acid in K562 cells. We conclude that arginine transport in human erythroid cells is due to both system y(+) (CAT1 transporter) and system y(+)L (4F2hc/y(+)LAT2 isoform), which mainly contribute, respectively, to the influx and to the efflux of the cationic amino acid.	eng	1163	1173	Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology	458	6	2009	Oct		D048868/Q000502;D027182/Q000378;D026923/Q000502;D000818;D001120/Q000378;D027201/Q000378;D015672/Q000378;D027282/Q000502;D020868;D006801;D020014;D027283/Q000378;D009865/Q000378;D014982	Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/physiology;Amino Acid Transport System y+/metabolism;Amino Acid Transport Systems, Basic/physiology;Animals;Arginine/metabolism;Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1/metabolism;Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism;Fusion Regulatory Protein 1, Heavy Chain/physiology;Gene Silencing;Humans;K562 Cells;Large Neutral Amino Acid-Transporter 1/metabolism;Oocytes/metabolism;Xenopus laevis	Rotoli BM;Closs EI;Barilli A;Visigalli R;Simon A;Habermeier A;Bianchi N;Gambari R;Gazzola GC;Bussolati O;Dall'Asta V	Journal, Articles					10.1007/s00424-009-0692-9		Erythro;erythro	True
777	19320779	Modulation of suicidal erythrocyte cation channels by an AMPA antagonist.	In neurons alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors are heteromeric cation channels composed of different sub-units, including GluA1-GluA4. When expressed without GluA2, AMPA receptors function as Ca(2+)-permeable cation channels. In erythrocytes, activation of Ca(2+)-permeable cation channels triggers suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis, which is characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with subsequent exposure of phosphatidylserine at the cell surface. Activators of the channels and thus eryptosis include removal of extracellular Cl(-) (replaced by gluconate) and energy depletion (removal of glucose). The present study explored whether GluA1 is expressed in human erythrocytes and whether pharmacological AMPA receptor inhibition modifies Ca(2+) entry and suicidal death of human erythrocytes. GluA1 protein abundance was determined by confocal microscopy, phosphatidylserine exposure was estimated from annexin V binding, cell volume from forward scatter in FACS analysis, cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration from Fluo3 fluorescence and channel activity by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. As a result, GluA1 is indeed expressed in the erythrocyte cell membrane. The AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX (1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide) inhibited the cation channels following Cl(-) removal and the eryptosis following Cl(-) removal or energy depletion. The present study reveals a novel action of AMPA receptor antagonists and raises the possibility that GluA1 or a pharmacologically related protein participates in the regulation of Ca(2+) entry into and suicidal death of human erythrocytes.	eng	3680	3686	Journal of cellular and molecular medicine	13	9B	2009	Sep		D002118/Q000378;D002412/Q000378;D016923;D002469;D002712/Q000737;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005434;D005786;D006801;D007962/Q000166;D018613/Q000379;D018408;D018091/Q000037	Calcium/metabolism;Cations/metabolism;Cell Death;Cell Separation;Chlorides/chemistry;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Flow Cytometry;Gene Expression Regulation;Humans;Leukocytes/cytology;Microscopy, Confocal/methods;Patch-Clamp Techniques;Receptors, AMPA/antagonists & inhibitors	Föller M;Mahmud H;Gu S;Kucherenko Y;Gehring EM;Shumilina E;Floride E;Sprengel R;Lang F	Journal, Articles					10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00745.x		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
778	19533417	The P2X(7) receptor mediates the uptake of organic cations in canine erythrocytes and mononuclear leukocytes: comparison to equivalent human cell types.	We previously demonstrated that canine erythrocytes express the P2X(7) receptor, and that the function and expression of this receptor is greatly increased compared with human erythrocytes. Using (86)Rb(+) (K(+)) and organic cation flux measurements, we further compared P2X(7) in erythrocytes and mononuclear leukocytes from these species. Concentration response curves of BzATP- and ATP-induced (86)Rb(+) efflux demonstrated that canine P2X(7) was less sensitive to inhibition by extracellular Na(+) ions compared to human P2X(7). In contrast, canine and human P2X(7) showed a similar sensitivity to the P2X(7) antagonists KN-62 and Mg(2+). KN-62 and Mg(2+) also inhibited ATP-induced choline(+) uptake into canine and human erythrocytes. BzATP and ATP but not ADP or NAD induced ethidium(+) uptake into canine monocytes, T- and B-cells. ATP-induced ethidium(+) uptake was twofold greater in canine T-cells compared to canine B-cells and monocytes. KN-62 inhibited the ATP-induced ethidium(+) uptake in each cell type. P2X(7)-mediated uptake of organic cations was 40- and fivefold greater in canine erythrocytes and lymphocytes (T- and B-cells), respectively, compared to equivalent human cell types. In contrast, P2X(7) function was threefold lower in canine monocytes compared to human monocytes. Thus, P2X(7) activation can induce the uptake of organic cations into canine erythrocytes and mononuclear leukocytes, but the relative levels of P2X(7) function differ to that of equivalent human cell types.	eng	385	394	Purinergic signalling	5	3	2009	Sep				Stevenson RO;Taylor RM;Wiley JS;Sluyter R	Journal, Articles					10.1007/s11302-009-9163-1		erythrocyte	True
779	19602584	Intra-arterial AICA-riboside administration induces NO-dependent vasodilation in vivo in human skeletal muscle.	In animal models, administration of the adenosine analog AICA-riboside has shown beneficial effects on ischemia-reperfusion injury and glucose homeostasis. The vascular and/or metabolic effects of AICA-riboside administration in humans remain to be established. AICA-riboside was infused intra-arterially in four different dosages up to 8 mg x min(-1) x dl(-1) in 24 healthy subjects. Forearm blood flow (FBF) and glucose uptake and plasma glucose, free fatty acid, and AICA-riboside concentrations were assessed. We also combined AICA-riboside infusion (2 mg x min(-1) x dl(-1)) with the intra-arterial administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine (90 microg x min(-1) x dl(-1); n = 6) and with the endothelial NO synthase inhibitor l-NMMA (0.4 mg x min(-1) x dl(-1); n = 6). Additional in vitro experiments were performed to explain our in vivo effects of AICA-riboside in humans. AICA-riboside increased FBF dose dependently from 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 13.2 +/- 1.9 ml x min(-1) x dl(-1) maximally (P < 0.05 for all dosages). The latter was not reduced by caffeine administration but was significantly attenuated by l-NMMA infusion. Despite high plasma AICA-riboside concentrations, forearm glucose uptake did not change. In vitro experiments showed rapid uptake of AICA-riboside by the equilibrative nucleoside transporter in erythrocytes and subsequent phosphorylation to AICA-ribotide. We conclude that AICA-riboside induces a potent vasodilator response in humans that is mediated by NO. Despite high local plasma concentrations, AICA-riboside does not increase skeletal muscle glucose uptake.	eng	E759	E766	American journal of physiology.

780	19826192	Participation of leukotriene C(4) in the regulation of suicidal erythrocyte death.	Eryptosis, the suicidal death of erythrocytes, is characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine exposure at the erythrocyte surface. Eryptosis is triggered by increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration upon energy depletion. The present study explored the involvement of leukotrienes. Western blotting was employed to detect the cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor cysLT1, competitive immune assay to determine leukotriene release from erythrocytes, Fluo3 fluorescence to estimate cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, forward scatter to analyse cell volume and annexin V-binding to disclose phosphatidylserine exposure. As a result, erythrocytes expressed the leukotriene receptor CysLT1. Glucose depletion (24 hours) significantly increased the formation of the cysteinyl-leukotrienes C(4)/D(4)/E(4). Leukotriene C(4) (10 nM) increased Ca(2+) entry, decreased forward scatter, activated caspases 3 and 8, and stimulated annexin V-binding. Glucose depletion similarly increased annexin V-binding, an effect significantly blunted in the presence of the leukotriene receptor antagonist cinalukast (1 microM) or the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor BW B70C (1 microM). In conclusion, upon energy depletion erythrocytes form leukotrienes, which in turn activate cation channels, leading to Ca(2+) entry, cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling. Cysteinyl-leukotrienes thus participate in the signaling of eryptosis during energy depletion.	eng	135	143	Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society	60	3	2009	Sep		D015153;D002118/Q000378;D053148/Q000378;D053181/Q000378;D018929;D016923/Q000187;D048429/Q000187;D002478;D004910/Q000187;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005947/Q000172;D006801;D006918/Q000031;D006918/Q000494;D017997/Q000037;D017997/Q000494;D017997/Q000502;D018613;D010718/Q000494;D018077/Q000096;D013844/Q000494	Blotting, Western;Calcium/metabolism;Caspase 3/metabolism;Caspase 8/metabolism;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Death/drug effects;Cell Size/drug effects;Cells, Cultured;Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose/deficiency;Humans;Hydroxyurea/analogs & derivatives;Hydroxyurea/pharmacology;Leukotriene C4/antagonists & inhibitors;Leukotriene C4/pharmacology;Leukotriene C4/physiology;Microscopy, Confocal;Phosphatidylserines/pharmacology;Receptors, Leukotriene/biosynthesis;Thiazoles/pharmacology	Foller M;Mahmud H;Gu S;Wang K;Floride E;Kucherenko Y;Luik S;Laufer S;Lang F	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
781	19584050	The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is not dependent on host coenzyme A biosynthesis.	Pantothenate, a precursor of the fundamental enzyme cofactor coenzyme A (CoA), is essential for growth of the intraerythrocytic stage of human and avian malaria parasites. Avian malaria parasites have been reported to be incapable of de novo CoA synthesis and instead salvage CoA from the host erythrocyte; hence, pantothenate is required for CoA biosynthesis within the host cell and not the parasite itself. Whether the same is true of the intraerythrocytic stage of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, remained to be established. In this study we investigated the metabolic fate of [(14)C]pantothenate within uninfected and P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes. We provide evidence consistent with normal human erythrocytes, unlike rat erythrocytes (which have been reported to possess an incomplete CoA biosynthesis pathway), being capable of CoA biosynthesis from pantothenate. We also show that CoA biosynthesis is substantially higher in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and that P. falciparum, unlike its avian counterpart, generates most of the CoA synthesized in the infected erythrocyte, presumably necessitated by insufficient CoA biosynthesis in the host erythrocyte. Our data raise the possibility that malaria parasites rationalize their biosynthetic activity depending on the capacity of their host cell to synthesize the metabolites they require.	eng	24904	24913	The Journal of biological chemistry	284	37	2009	Sep	11	D000818;D002851;D003065/Q000737;D004910/Q000378;D004910/Q000469;D004912/Q000469;D006801;D016778/Q000097;D016778/Q000469;D008954;D008956;D010205/Q000493;D010766;D010963;D015800/Q000378;D013997	Animals;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Coenzyme A/chemistry;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/parasitology;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Humans;Malaria, Falciparum/blood;Malaria, Falciparum/parasitology;Models, Biological;Models, Chemical;Pantothenic Acid/pharmacokinetics;Phosphorylation;Plasmodium falciparum;Protozoan Proteins/metabolism;Time Factors	Spry C;Saliba KJ	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M109.025312		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
782	20631410	Red blood cells (RBCs), epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).	In addition to serving as carriers of O(2), red blood cells (RBCs) regulate vascular resistance and the distribution of microvascular perfusion by liberating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) upon exposure to a low O(2) environment. Therefore, RBCs act as sensors that respond to low pO(2) by releasing millimolar amounts of ATP, a signaling molecule, and lipid mediators (EETs). The release of EETs occurs by a mechanism that is activated by ATP stimulation of P2X(7) receptors coupled to ATP transporters, which should greatly amplify the circulatory response to ATP. RBCs are reservoirs of EETs and the primary sources of plasma EETs, which are esterified to the phospholipids of lipoproteins. Levels of free EETs in plasma are low, about 3% of circulating EETs. RBC EETs are produced by direct oxidation of arachidonic acid (AA) esterified to glycerophospholipids and the monooxygenase-like activity of hemoglobin. On release, EETs affect vascular tone, produce profibrinolysis and dampen inflammation. A soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) regulates the concentrations of RBC and vascular EETs by metabolizing both cis- and trans-EETs to form dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs). The function and pathophysiological roles of trans-EETs and erythro-DHETs has yet to be integrated into a physiological and pathophysiological context.	eng	468	474	Pharmacological reports : PR	62	3	2010			D000255/Q000097;D000255/Q000378;D000818;D016718/Q000378;D015777/Q000097;D015777/Q000378;D004851/Q000097;D004851/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D051381	Adenosine Triphosphate/blood;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Animals;Arachidonic Acid/metabolism;Eicosanoids/blood;Eicosanoids/metabolism;Epoxide Hydrolases/blood;Epoxide Hydrolases/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Rats	Jiang H;Anderson GD;McGiff JC	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythro;Red blood cell;red blood cell;RBC	True
783	20631411	Regulation of cAMP by phosphodiesterases in erythrocytes.	The erythrocyte, a cell responsible for carrying and delivering oxygen in the body, has often been regarded as simply a vehicle for the circulation of hemoglobin. However, it has become evident that this cell also participates in the regulation of vascular caliber in the microcirculation via release of the potent vasodilator, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The regulated release of ATP from erythrocytes occurs via a defined signaling pathway and requires increases in cyclic 3',5'- adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). It is well recognized that cAMP is a critical second messenger in diverse signaling pathways. In all cells increases in cAMP are localized and regulated by the activity of phosphodiesterases (PDEs). In erythrocytes activation of either beta adrenergic receptors (beta(2)AR) or the prostacyclin receptor (IPR) results in increases in cAMP and ATP release. Receptor-mediated increases in cAMP are tightly regulated by distinct PDEs associated with each signaling pathway as shown by the finding that selective inhibitors of the PDEs localized to each pathway potentiate both increases in cAMP and ATP release. Here we review the profile of PDEs identified in erythrocytes, their association with specific signaling pathways and their role in the regulation of ATP release from these cells. Understanding the contribution of PDEs to the control of ATP release from erythrocytes identifies this cell as a potential target for the development of drugs for the treatment of vascular disease.	eng	475	482	Pharmacological reports : PR	62	3	2010			D000818;D002451;D000242/Q000097;D000242/Q000378;D054677/Q000097;D054677/Q000378;D054678/Q000097;D054678/Q000378;D054684/Q000097;D054684/Q000378;D054703/Q000097;D054703/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D010727/Q000097;D010727/Q000378;D011817;D015398	Animals;Cell Compartmentation;Cyclic AMP/blood;Cyclic AMP/metabolism;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 1/blood;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 1/metabolism;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 2/blood;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 2/metabolism;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3/blood;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3/metabolism;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4/blood;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/blood;Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/metabolism;Rabbits;Signal Transduction	Adderley SP;Sprague RS;Stephenson AH;Hanson MS	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
784	20932078	The Dombrock blood group system: a review.	The Dombrock blood group system (Do) consists of two antithetical antigens (Do(a) and Do(b)) and five antigens of high prevalence (Gy(a), Hy, Jo(a), DOYA, and DOMR). Do antigens are carried on the Dombrock glycoprotein, which is attached to the RBC membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage. The gene (DO, ART4) encoding the Do glycoprotein, located on the short arm of chromosome 12, has been cloned and sequenced, allowing the molecular basis of the various Do phenotypes to be determined. Do(a) and Do(b) have a prevalence that makes them useful as genetic markers; however, the paucity of reliable anti-Do(a) and anti-Do(b) has prevented this potential from being realized. The ease with which these antigens can be predicted by analysis of DNA opens the door for such studies to be carried out. Anti-Do(a) and anti-Do(b) are rarely found as a single specificity, but they have been implicated in causing hemolytic transfusion reactions. This review is a synthesis of our current knowledge of he Dombrock blood group system.	eng	71	78	Immunohematology	26	2	2010			D036002/Q000235;D036002/Q000276;D036002/Q000378;D001789/Q000235;D001789/Q000276;D001789/Q000378;D002881/Q000235;D002881/Q000276;D002881/Q000378;D004910/Q000235;D004910/Q000276;D004910/Q000378;D005819/Q000276;D006801;D007518/Q000097;D007518/Q000276;D008565/Q000235;D008565/Q000276;D008565/Q000378	ADP Ribose Transferases/genetics;ADP Ribose Transferases/immunology;ADP Ribose Transferases/metabolism;Blood Group Antigens/genetics;Blood Group Antigens/immunology;Blood Group Antigens/metabolism;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/immunology;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/genetics;Erythrocyte Membrane/immunology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Genetic Markers/immunology;Humans;Isoantibodies/blood;Isoantibodies/immunology;Membrane Proteins/genetics;Membrane Proteins/immunology;Membrane Proteins/metabolism	Lomas-Francis C;Reid ME	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte	True
785	20216118	Determination of 6-thioguanosine diphosphate and triphosphate and nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity in erythrocytes: novel targets for thiopurine therapy?	6-Thioguanine nucleotides are the sum of 6-thioguanosine 5'-monophosphate (TGMP), -diphosphate (TGDP), and -triphosphate (TGTP) representing essential metabolites involved in drug action of thiopurines. Elevated levels of TGDP have been associated with poor response to azathioprine therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The conversion of TGDP to TGTP is supposed to be catalyzed by nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK). The aim of this work was to investigate simultaneously individual 6-thioguanosine phosphate levels and NDPK activity in red blood cells (RBCs) of patients on azathioprine therapy. Ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography methods with fluorescence and ultraviolet detection were applied to quantify individual levels of 6-thioguanosine 5'-phosphates and NDPK activity, respectively, in RBCs. Recombinantly expressed NDPK isoforms A and B were unequivocally identified to catalyze the formation of TGTP (30.6 +/- 3.88 nmol x min x mg for NDPK A versus 41.2 +/- 1.05 nmol x min x mg for NDPK B). Comprehensive analyses on the stability of TGMP, TGDP, and TGTP and the reproducibility of NDPK activity in RBCs were performed to provide a reliable sampling protocol for clinical practice. Of note, isolation of RBCs within 6 hours followed by immediate storage at -80 degrees C is crucial for prevention of degradation of 5'-phosphates. In a clinical study of 37 patients on azathioprine, TGTP was the predominant 6-thioguanosine phosphate in RBCs. In contrast, three patients showed TGTP/(TGDP + TGTP) ratios of 57.2%, 64.3%, and 66% corresponding to elevated TGDP levels. NDPK activity ranged from 4.1 to 11.3 nmol x min x mg hemoglobin. No correlation between NDPK activity and the 6-thioguanosine phosphate levels was found. The question whether interindividual variability of NDPK activity may explain differences in 6-thioguanosine 5'-phosphates levels has to be investigated in a prospective large-scale study.	eng	119	128	Therapeutic drug monitoring	32	2	2010	Apr		D000293;D000328;D000368;D001379/Q000008;D002384;D016503/Q000639;D004789/Q000187;D004789/Q000502;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006153/Q000031;D006153/Q000097;D006160/Q000031;D006160/Q000097;D006801;D008297;D008875;D009701/Q000097;D011687/Q000627;D013873/Q000097;D055815	Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Azathioprine/administration & dosage;Catalysis;Drug Delivery Systems/trends;Enzyme Activation/drug effects;Enzyme Activation/physiology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Guanosine Diphosphate/analogs & derivatives;Guanosine Diphosphate/blood;Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives;Guanosine Triphosphate/blood;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/blood;Purines/therapeutic use;Thionucleotides/blood;Young Adult	Karner S;Shi S;Fischer C;Schaeffeler E;Neurath MF;Herrlinger KR;Hofmann U;Schwab M	Journal, Articles					10.1097/FTD.0b013e3181d12f19		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
786	20962000	Hydrogen ion dynamics in human red blood cells.	Our understanding of pH regulation within red blood cells (RBCs) has been inferred mainly from indirect experiments rather than from in situ measurements of intracellular pH (pH(i)). The present work shows that carboxy-SNARF-1, a pH fluorophore, when used with confocal imaging or flow cytometry, reliably reports pH(i) in individual, human RBCs, provided intracellular fluorescence is calibrated using a 'null-point' procedure. Mean pH(i) was 7.25 in CO(2)/HCO(3)(-)-buffered medium and 7.15 in Hepes-buffered medium, and varied linearly with extracellular pH (slope of 0.77). Intrinsic (non-CO(2)/HCO(3)(-)-dependent) buffering power, estimated in the intact cell (85 mmol (l cell)(-1) (pH unit)(-1) at resting pH(i)), was somewhat higher than previous estimates from cell lysates (50-70 mmol (l cell)(-1) (pH unit)(-1)). Acute displacement of pH(i) (superfusion of weak acids/bases) triggered rapid pH(i) recovery. This was mediated via membrane Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-) exchange (the AE1 gene product), irrespective of whether recovery was from an intracellular acid or base load, and with no evident contribution from other transporters such as Na(+)/H(+) exchange. H(+)-equivalent flux through AE1 was a linear function of [H(+)](i) and reversed at resting pH(i), indicating that its activity is not allosterically regulated by pH(i), in contrast to other AE isoforms. By simultaneously monitoring pH(i) and markers of cell volume, a functional link between membrane ion transport, volume and pH(i) was demonstrated. RBC pH(i) is therefore tightly regulated via AE1 activity, but modulated during changes of cell volume. A comparable volume-pH(i) link may also be important in other cell types expressing anion exchangers. Direct measurement of pH(i) should be useful in future investigations of RBC physiology and pathology.	eng	4995	5014	The Journal of physiology	588	Pt 24	2010	Dec	15	D001457/Q000502;D001578/Q000737;D001578/Q000378;D001639;D002021;D002245;D002712/Q000378;D004912/Q000502;D005453;D006801;D006863;D009284/Q000737;D009284/Q000378;D011522;D012235/Q000737;D012235/Q000378	Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/physiology;Benzopyrans/chemistry;Benzopyrans/metabolism;Bicarbonates;Buffers;Carbon Dioxide;Chlorides/metabolism;Erythrocytes/physiology;Fluorescence;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Naphthols/chemistry;Naphthols/metabolism;Protons;Rhodamines/chemistry;Rhodamines/metabolism	Swietach P;Tiffert T;Mauritz JM;Seear R;Esposito A;Kaminski CF;Lew VL;Vaughan-Jones RD	Journal, Articles					10.1113/jphysiol.2010.197392		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
787	20404042	Insulin inhibits human erythrocyte cAMP accumulation and ATP release: role of phosphodiesterase 3 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.	In non-erythroid cells, insulin stimulates a signal transduction pathway that results in the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and subsequent phosphorylation of phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3). Erythrocytes possess insulin receptors, PI3K and PDE3B. These cells release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) when exposed to reduced O(2) tension via a signaling pathway that requires activation of the G protein, Gi, as well as increases in cAMP. Although insulin inhibits ATP release from human erythrocytes in response to Gi activation by mastoparan 7 (Mas 7), no effect on cAMP was described. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that insulin activates PDE3 in human erythrocytes via a PI3K-mediated mechanism resulting in cAMP hydrolysis and inhibition of ATP release. Incubation of human erythrocytes with Mas 7 resulted in a 62 +/- 7% increase in cAMP (n = 9, P < 0.05) and a 306 +/- 69% increase in ATP release (n = 9, P < 0.05), both of which were attenuated by pre-treatment with insulin. Selective inhibitors of PDE3 (cilostazol) or PI3K (LY294002) rescued these effects of insulin. These results support the hypothesis that insulin activates PDE3 in erythrocytes via a PI3K-dependent mechanism. Once activated, PDE3 limits Mas 7-induced increases in intracellular cAMP. This effect of insulin leads, ultimately, to decreased ATP release in response to Mas 7. Activation of Gi is required for reduced O(2) tension-induced ATP release from erythrocytes and this ATP release has been shown to participate in the matching of O(2) supply with demand in skeletal muscle. Thus, pathological increases in circulating insulin could, via activation of PDE3 in erythrocytes, inhibit ATP release from these cells, depriving the peripheral circulation of one mechanism that could aid in the regulation of the delivery of O(2) to meet tissue metabolic need.	eng	256	262	Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)	235	2	2010	Feb		D000255/Q000097;D000328;D002867/Q000494;D000077407;D000242/Q000097;D054684/Q000097;D004791/Q000494;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D019206/Q000097;D006801;D066298;D007328/Q000097;D007328/Q000494;D036341;D008297;D008875;D008954;D009025/Q000494;D010100/Q000097;D010455/Q000494;D019869/Q000097;D058987;D000081082;D015398/Q000187;D013777/Q000494	Adenosine Triphosphate/blood;Adult;Chromones/pharmacology;Cilostazol;Cyclic AMP/blood;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3/blood;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go/blood;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Insulin/blood;Insulin/pharmacology;Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;Morpholines/pharmacology;Oxygen/blood;Peptides/pharmacology;Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/blood;Phosphodiesterase 3 Inhibitors;Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors;Signal Transduction/drug effects;Tetrazoles/pharmacology	Hanson MS;Stephenson AH;Bowles EA;Sprague RS	Journal, Articles					10.1258/ebm.2009.009206		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
788	19968714	Biopreservation of red blood cells--the struggle with hemoglobin oxidation.	One of the least recognized causes of cellular damage during ex vivo preservation of red blood cells is oxidative injury to the hemoglobin. The latter has been associated with hemolysis through the release of toxic substances and oxidation of vital cell components. This review delineates some of the major pathways that link hemoglobin oxidation and cellular damage, and summarizes the incidence of red blood cell oxidative injury during hypothermic storage, cryopreservation and desiccation stress. Red blood cell hypothermic storage, despite its success, is not exempt from oxidative injury. Growing evidence portrays a time-dependant oxidative assault including formation of reactive oxygen species, attachment of denatured hemoglobin to membrane phospholipids and the release of hemoglobin-containing membrane microvesicles throughout storage. Similar symptoms have been observed in attempts to stabilize red blood cells in the dried state, in which methemoglobin levels of reconstituted red blood cells reached 50%. Factors affecting the rate of hemoglobin oxidation during red blood cell ex vivo storage include compromised antioxidant activity, high concentrations of glucose in the storage media and the presence of molecular oxygen. Hemoglobin oxidation largely dictates our ability to effectively preserve red blood cells. Understanding its origins along with investigating methods to minimize it can significantly improve the quality of our future blood products.	eng	343	356	The FEBS journal	277	2	2010	Jan		D001793/Q000379;D003080;D015925;D003451;D003890;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006454/Q000737;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D006861/Q000378;D066298;D015227;D008706/Q000737;D008706/Q000378;D008954;D010084;D010108/Q000737;D010108/Q000378;D011489;D017382/Q000378	Blood Preservation/methods;Cold Temperature;Cryopreservation;Cryoprotective Agents;Desiccation;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemoglobins/chemistry;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism;In Vitro Techniques;Lipid Peroxidation;Methemoglobin/chemistry;Methemoglobin/metabolism;Models, Biological;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxyhemoglobins/chemistry;Oxyhemoglobins/metabolism;Protein Denaturation;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism	Kanias T;Acker JP	Journal, Articles					10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07472.x		Erythrocyte;red blood cell;Red blood cell	True
789	19540949	Red blood cell (RBC) membrane proteomics--Part I: Proteomics and RBC physiology.	Membrane proteomics is concerned with accurately and sensitively identifying molecules involved in cell compartmentalisation, including those controlling the interface between the cell and the outside world. The high lipid content of the environment in which these proteins are found often causes a particular set of problems that must be overcome when isolating the required material before effective HPLC-MS approaches can be performed. The membrane is an unusually dynamic cellular structure since it interacts with an ever changing environment. A full understanding of this critical cell component will ultimately require, in addition to proteomics, lipidomics, glycomics, interactomics and study of post-translational modifications. Devoid of nucleus and organelles in mammalian species other than camelids, and constantly in motion in the blood stream, red blood cells (RBCs) are the sole mammalian oxygen transporter. The fact that mature mammalian RBCs have no internal membrane-bound organelles, somewhat simplifies proteomics analysis of the plasma membrane and the fact that it has no nucleus disqualifies microarray based methods. Proteomics has the potential to provide a better understanding of this critical interface, and thereby assist in identifying new approaches to diseases.	eng	403	420	Journal of proteomics	73	3	2010	Jan	03	D000595;D002450/Q000502;D048429;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000502;D005502;D006801;D008954;D008969;D020543/Q000032;D020543/Q000378;D040901/Q000379;D040901/Q000592;D017386	Amino Acid Sequence;Cell Communication/physiology;Cell Size;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/physiology;Food;Humans;Models, Biological;Molecular Sequence Data;Proteome/analysis;Proteome/metabolism;Proteomics/methods;Proteomics/standards;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid	Pasini EM;Lutz HU;Mann M;Thomas AW	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.jprot.2009.06.005		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;Red blood cell	True
790	19758581	Current knowledge about the functional roles of phosphorylative changes of membrane proteins in normal and diseased red cells.	With the advent of proteomic techniques the number of known post-translational modifications (PTMs) affecting red cell membrane proteins is rapidly growing but the understanding of their role under physiological and pathological conditions is incompletely established. The wide range of hereditary diseases affecting different red cell membrane functions and the membrane modifications induced by malaria parasite intracellular growth represent a unique opportunity to study PTMs in response to variable cellular stresses. In the present review, some of the major areas of interest in red cell membrane research have been considered as modifications of erythrocyte deformability and maintenance of the surface area, membrane transport alterations, and removal of diseased and senescent red cells. In all mentioned research areas the functional roles of PTMs are prevalently restricted to the phosphorylative changes of the more abundant membrane proteins. The insufficient information about the PTMs occurring in a large majority of the red membrane proteins and the general lack of mass spectrometry data evidence the need of new comprehensive, proteomic approaches to improve the understanding of the red cell membrane physiology.	eng	445	455	Journal of proteomics	73	3	2010	Jan	03	D001692/Q000502;D004194/Q000209;D004905/Q000502;D004907/Q000502;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000473;D006801;D019359;D008565/Q000032;D008565/Q000378;D010766/Q000502;D011494/Q000378;D011499/Q000502	Biological Transport/physiology;Disease/etiology;Erythrocyte Aging/physiology;Erythrocyte Deformability/physiology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/pathology;Humans;Knowledge;Membrane Proteins/analysis;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Phosphorylation/physiology;Protein Kinases/metabolism;Protein Processing, Post-Translational/physiology	Pantaleo A;De Franceschi L;Ferru E;Vono R;Turrini F	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.jprot.2009.08.011		erythrocyte;Erythrocyte;red cell	True
791	19778645	Quantitative erythrocyte membrane proteome analysis with Blue-native/SDS PAGE.	The erythrocyte membrane plays a pivotal role in erythrocyte functioning. Many membrane protein aberrations are known that result in hemolytic anemia, however, the origin of numerous disorders is not known to date. To extend the current set of diagnostic tools, we used a novel proteome-wide approach to quantitatively analyze membrane proteins of healthy donor and patient erythrocytes. Blue-native PAGE has proven to be a powerful tool for separation of membrane proteins and their complexes, but has hitherto not been applied to erythrocyte membranes to find biomarkers. Using this technique, we detected almost 150 protein spots, from which more than 500 proteins could be identified by LC-MS/MS. Further, we successfully assessed the potential of using CyDye labeling to quantify the membrane proteins. Our final goal was to determine if this approach is suited to detect protein level changes in disordered erythrocyte membranes, and we could successfully confirm that erythrocyte spectrin levels were dramatically decreased for a hemolytic anemia patient. This approach provides a new tool to detect potential biomarkers and can contribute to an improved understanding of the causes of erythrocyte membrane defects in patients suffering from hemolytic anemia.	eng	456	465	Journal of proteomics	73	3	2010	Jan	03	D000328;D000740/Q000097;D001782;D002138;D015180/Q000379;D015180/Q000592;D004591/Q000379;D004591/Q000592;D004910/Q000737;D004910/Q000378;D005260;D005456/Q000494;D006262;D006801;D046912/Q000032;D046912/Q000378;D011489/Q000502;D020543/Q000032;D020543/Q000378;D040901/Q000379;D040901/Q000592;D012394/Q000494	Adult;Anemia/blood;Blood Donors;Calibration;Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional/methods;Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional/standards;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/standards;Erythrocyte Membrane/chemistry;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Female;Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology;Health;Humans;Multiprotein Complexes/analysis;Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism;Protein Denaturation/physiology;Proteome/analysis;Proteome/metabolism;Proteomics/methods;Proteomics/standards;Rosaniline Dyes/pharmacology	van Gestel RA;van Solinge WW;van der Toorn HW;Rijksen G;Heck AJ;van Wijk R;Slijper M	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.jprot.2009.08.010		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
792	20207939	Role of alkaline ceramidases in the generation of sphingosine and its phosphate in erythrocytes.	Plasma sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been suggested to mainly originate from erythrocytes; however, within the erythrocyte, how sphingosine (SPH) generation--the precursor to S1P--is controlled is unknown. SPH is only generated from the hydrolysis of ceramides via ceramidases. Five human ceramidases have been identified: 1 acid, 1 neutral, and 3 alkaline ceramidases (ACER1, ACER2, and ACER3). Here, we demonstrate that only alkaline ceramidase activity is expressed in erythrocytes and that it is instrumental for SPH generation. Erythrocytes have alkaline but not acid or neutral ceramidase activity on D-e-C(18:1)-ceramide, a common substrate of ceramidases. Not only alkaline ceramidase activity but also the generation of SPH and S1P are increased during erythroid differentiation in K562 erythroleukemic cells. Such SPH and S1P increases were inhibited by the alkaline ceramidase inhibitor D-e-MAPP, suggesting that alkaline ceramidases have a role in the generation of SPH and S1P in erythroid cells. Alkaline ceramidase activity is highly expressed in mouse erythrocytes, and intravenous administration of D-e-MAPP decreased both SPH and S1P in erythrocytes and plasma. Collectively, these results suggest that alkaline ceramidase activity is important for the generation of SPH, the S1P precursor in erythrocytes.	eng	2507	2515	FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology	24	7	2010	Jul		D055574/Q000378;D000818;D002454;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D020014;D008246/Q000096;D051379;D013110/Q000031;D013110/Q000096;D013110/Q000378;D015854	Alkaline Ceramidase/metabolism;Animals;Cell Differentiation;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;K562 Cells;Lysophospholipids/biosynthesis;Mice;Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives;Sphingosine/biosynthesis;Sphingosine/metabolism;Up-Regulation	Xu R;Sun W;Jin J;Obeid LM;Mao C	Journal, Articles					10.1096/fj.09-153635		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True

O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance and glucose toxicity. O-GlcNAcylation is regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which attaches O-GlcNAc to serine and/or threonine residues of proteins and by O-GlcNAcase, which removes O-GlcNAc. We investigated the expression of these two enzymes in erythrocytes of human subjects with diabetes or pre-diabetes.	eng	1845	1850	Diabetes	59	7	2010	Jul		D000118/Q000378;D000328;D000368;D015153;D003922/Q000201;D003924/Q000201;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007333;D008297;D008875;D010865;D011236/Q000201	Acetylglucosaminidase/metabolism;Adult;Aged;Blotting, Western;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/enzymology;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/enzymology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;Insulin Resistance;Male;Middle Aged;Pilot Projects;Prediabetic State/enzymology	Park K;Saudek CD;Hart GW	Journal, Articles					10.2337/db09-1086		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
794	20498365	Glutathione synthesis and turnover in the human erythrocyte: alignment of a model based on detailed enzyme kinetics with experimental data.	The erythrocyte is exposed to reactive oxygen species in the circulation and also to those produced by autoxidation of hemoglobin. Consequently, erythrocytes depend on protection by the antioxidant glutathione. Mathematical models based on realistic kinetic data have provided valuable insights into the regulation of biochemical pathways within the erythrocyte but none have satisfactorily accounted for glutathione metabolism. In the current model, rate equations were derived for the enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and for each equation the nonlinear algebraic relationship between the steady-state kinetic parameters and the unitary rate constants was derived. The model also includes the transport processes that supply the amino acid constituents of glutathione and the export of oxidized glutathione. Values of the kinetic parameters for the individual reactions were measured predominately using isolated enzymes under conditions that differed from the intracellular environment. By comparing the experimental and simulated results, the values of the enzyme-kinetic parameters of the model were refined to yield conformity between model simulations and experimental data. Model output accurately represented the steady-state concentrations of metabolites in erythrocytes suspended in plasma and the changing glutathione concentrations in whole and hemolyzed erythrocytes under specific experimental conditions. Analysis indicated that feedback inhibition of gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase by glutathione had a limited effect on steady-state glutathione concentrations and was not sufficiently potent to return glutathione concentrations to normal levels in erythrocytes exposed to sustained increases in oxidative load.	eng	23557	23567	The Journal of biological chemistry	285	31	2010	Jul	30	D000328;D000410/Q000737;D002384;D004912/Q000378;D005786;D005721/Q000378;D005972/Q000737;D005978/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008875;D008954;D008962;D018384;D010100/Q000737	Adult;Alanine Transaminase/chemistry;Catalysis;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Gene Expression Regulation;Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/metabolism;Glutaminase/chemistry;Glutathione/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;Models, Theoretical;Oxidative Stress;Oxygen/chemistry	Raftos JE;Whillier S;Kuchel PW	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M109.067017		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
795	20231105	Altered phosphorylation of cytoskeleton proteins in sickle red blood cells: the role of protein kinase C, Rac GTPases, and reactive oxygen species.	The small Rho GTPases Rac1 and Rac2 regulate actin structures and mediate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via NADPH oxidase in a variety of cells. We have demonstrated that deficiency of Rac1 and Rac2 GTPases in mice disrupts the normal hexagonal organization of the RBC cytoskeleton and reduces erythrocyte deformability. This is associated with increased phosphorylation of adducin at Ser-724, (corresponding to Ser-726 in human erythrocytes), a domain target of protein kinase C (PKC). PKC phosphorylates adducin and leads to decreased F-actin capping and dissociation of spectrin from actin, implicating a significant role of such phosphorylation in cytoskeletal remodeling. We evaluated adducin phosphorylation in erythrocytes from patients with sickle cell disease and found it consistently increased at Ser-726. In addition, ROS concentration is elevated in sickle erythrocytes by 150-250% compared to erythrocytes from normal control individuals. Here, we review previous studies demonstrating that altered phosphorylation of erythrocyte cytoskeletal proteins and increased ROS production result in disruption of cytoskeleton stability in healthy and sickle cell erythrocytes. We discuss in particular the known and potential roles of protein kinase C and the Rac GTPases in these two processes.	eng	41	45	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	45	1	2010	Jun	15	D000755/Q000201;D000755/Q000378;D000818;D003598/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000473;D006801;D011493/Q000378;D017382/Q000378;D020744/Q000378	Anemia, Sickle Cell/enzymology;Anemia, Sickle Cell/metabolism;Animals;Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/pathology;Humans;Protein Kinase C/metabolism;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism;rac GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism	George A;Pushkaran S;Li L;An X;Zheng Y;Mohandas N;Joiner CH;Kalfa TA	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bcmd.2010.02.006		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
796	20457531	Unique expression pattern of human nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase isozymes in red blood cells.	Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) catalyzes the formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). In humans, three isozymes have been identified: NMNAT1, which is widely expressed in all tissues, NMNAT2 and NMNAT3, which show a tissue-specific expression and whose mRNA levels are generally lower compared to NMNAT1. In the present study we determined the individual NMNAT isozymes activity in human red blood cells (RBCs) by using a biochemical discrimination assay based on the distinctive catalytic properties of the three proteins. We found that isozyme 3 predominates over isozyme 1, whereas isozyme 2 is absent. This high prevalence of NMNAT3 is cell-aging independent and was also confirmed by analyzing the mRNA and protein levels. RBC represent the first human cell type with a remarkable predominance of NMNAT3, and this unique expression pattern is discussed in light of the catalytic properties of the isozymes and in consideration of the biochemical microenvironment of RBC.	eng	33	39	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	45	1	2010	Jun	15	D015153;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D015971;D006801;D007527/Q000235;D007527/Q000378;D009612/Q000235;D009612/Q000378;D012333/Q000235;D020133	Blotting, Western;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic;Humans;Isoenzymes/genetics;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Nicotinamide-Nucleotide Adenylyltransferase/genetics;Nicotinamide-Nucleotide Adenylyltransferase/metabolism;RNA, Messenger/genetics;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction	Di Stefano M;Galassi L;Magni G	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bcmd.2010.04.003		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True

Human Rh C glycoprotein (RhCG) forms a trimeric complex that plays an essential role in ammonia excretion and renal pH regulation. The X-ray crystallographic structure of human RhCG, determined at 2.1 A resolution, reveals the mechanism of ammonia transport. Each monomer contains 12 transmembrane helices, one more than in the bacterial homologs. Reconstituted into proteoliposomes, RhCG conducts NH(3) to raise internal pH. Models of the erythrocyte Rh complex based on our RhCG structure suggest that the erythrocytic Rh complex is composed of stochastically assembled heterotrimers of RhAG, RhD, and RhCE.	eng	9638	9643	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	107	21	2010	May	25	D000641/Q000378;D001692;D027682/Q000737;D027682/Q000378;D002460;D018360;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D008562/Q000737;D008562/Q000378;D008958;D020836;D017434;D012204/Q000737;D012204/Q000378	Ammonia/metabolism;Biological Transport;Cation Transport Proteins/chemistry;Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism;Cell Line;Crystallography, X-Ray;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry;Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism;Models, Molecular;Protein Structure, Quaternary;Protein Structure, Tertiary;Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/chemistry;Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/metabolism	Gruswitz F;Chaudhary S;Ho JD;Schlessinger A;Pezeshki B;Ho CM;Sali A;Westhoff CM;Stroud RM	Journal, Articles					10.1073/pnas.1003587107		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
799	20622111	Pannexin 1 is the conduit for low oxygen tension-induced ATP release from human erythrocytes.	Erythrocytes release ATP in response to exposure to the physiological stimulus of lowered oxygen (O(2)) tension as well as pharmacological activation of the prostacyclin receptor (IPR). ATP release in response to these stimuli requires activation of adenylyl cyclase, accumulation of cAMP, and activation of protein kinase A. The mechanism by which ATP, a highly charged anion, exits the erythrocyte in response to lowered O(2) tension or receptor-mediated IPR activation by iloprost is unknown. It was demonstrated previously that inhibiting pannexin 1 with carbenoxolone inhibits hypotonically induced ATP release from human erythrocytes. Here we demonstrate that three structurally dissimilar compounds known to inhibit pannexin 1 prevent ATP release in response to lowered O(2) tension but not to iloprost-induced ATP release. These results suggest that pannexin 1 is the conduit for ATP release from erythrocytes in response to lowered O(2) tension. However, the identity of the conduit for iloprost-induced ATP release remains unknown.	eng	H1146	H1152	American journal of physiology.

800	20722631	HDHD1, which is often deleted in X-linked ichthyosis, encodes a pseudouridine-5'-phosphatase.	Pseudouridine, the fifth-most abundant nucleoside in RNA, is not metabolized in mammals, but is excreted intact in urine. The purpose of the present work was to search for an enzyme that would dephosphorylate pseudouridine 5'-phosphate, a potential intermediate in RNA degradation. We show that human erythrocytes contain a pseudouridine-5'-phosphatase displaying a Km ≤ 1 μM for its substrate. The activity of the partially purified enzyme was dependent on Mg2+, and was inhibited by Ca2+ and vanadate, suggesting that it belonged to the 'haloacid dehalogenase' family of phosphatases. Its low molecular mass (26 kDa) suggested that this phosphatase could correspond to the protein encoded by the HDHD1 (haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain-containing 1) gene, present next to the STS (steroid sulfatase) gene on human chromosome Xp22. Purified human recombinant HDHD1 dephosphorylated pseudouridine 5'-phosphate with a kcat of 1.6 s-1, a Km of 0.3 μM and a catalytic efficiency at least 1000-fold higher than that on which it acted on other phosphate esters, including 5'-UMP. The molecular identity of pseudouridine-5'-phosphatase was confirmed by the finding that its activity was negligible (<10% of controls) in extracts of B-cell lymphoblasts or erythrocytes from X-linked ichthyosis patients harbouring a combined deletion of the STS gene (the X-linked ichthyosis gene) and the HDHD1 gene. Furthermore, pseudouridine-5'-phosphatase activity was 1.5-fold higher in erythrocytes from women compared with men, in agreement with the HDHD1 gene undergoing only partial inactivation in females. In conclusion, HDHD1 is a phosphatase specifically involved in dephosphorylation of a modified nucleotide present in RNA.	eng	237	244	The Biochemical journal	431	2	2010	Oct	15	D000241/Q000378;D000595;D002457;D002460;D002850;D002852;D004912/Q000201;D004952/Q000378;D005260;D017353;D006801;D016114/Q000201;D016114/Q000235;D008297;D008969;D009708;D010744/Q000737;D010744/Q000302;D010744/Q000378;D011506/Q000737;D011506/Q000235;D011506/Q000378;D011560;D011994/Q000378;D016415;D017386;D012727;D013379	Adenosine/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Cell Extracts;Cell Line;Chromatography, Gel;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Esters/metabolism;Female;Gene Deletion;Humans;Ichthyosis, X-Linked/enzymology;Ichthyosis, X-Linked/genetics;Male;Molecular Sequence Data;Nucleotidases;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/chemistry;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/isolation & purification;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism;Proteins/chemistry;Proteins/genetics;Proteins/metabolism;Pseudouridine;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Sex Characteristics;Substrate Specificity	Preumont A;Rzem R;Vertommen D;Van Schaftingen E	Journal, Articles					10.1042/BJ20100174		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
801	21377322	Purification and biochemical characterization of glutathione S-transferase from Down syndrome and normal children erythrocytes: a comparative study.	Down syndrome (DS) is the phenotypic manifestation of trisomy 21. Our study was concerned with the characterization and purification of glutathione S-transferase enzyme (GST) from normal and Down syndrome (DS) erythrocytes to illustrate the difference in the role of this enzyme in the cell. Glutathione S-transferase and glutathione (GSH) was determined in ten DS and ten healthy children matched for age (3-10 years). DS group exhibited significantly lower GST value (2.7 units/gHb) as compared to controls (6.6 units/gHb) (40.9%). GST activity was significantly decreased to 40.9% in the DS group as compared to controls. Also GSH concentration was significantly decreased to 60.6% in the DS group compared to the controls. Glutathione transferase was purified from erythrocytes of normal and DS pooled blood samples by affinity chromatography with specific activity of 23.7% and 7.9%, respectively. The effect of freezing and thawing, storage time of freezing and GSH concentration on the stability of the enzyme were examined. Normal GST exhibited a pH optimum at pH 7 followed by sharp decrease, however DS GST exhibited pH optimum between pH 7.5 and 8. The Km values for 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and GSH were 0.205 mM and 0.786 mM, respectively, for normal GST, and 0.318 mM and 1.307 mM, respectively for DS GST. The activation energy (Ea) was calculated to be 2.25 and 4.25 cal/mol for normal GST and 3.8 cal/mol for DS GST. Normal and DS GST were inhibited by the same inhibitors (hematin, bromosulfophthalein and cibacron blue), but with different degree. On kinetic basis, the individuals with lower overall GST activity and slight differences in some kinetic characters are at greater risk from xenobiotic contamination as compared to those with higher overall GST activity observed in normal individuals.	eng	1470	1482	Research in developmental disabilities	32	5	2011			D000975/Q000378;D002384;D002648;D002675;D002846;D004314/Q000201;D004789/Q000502;D004791/Q000494;D004912/Q000201;D005978/Q000378;D051549/Q000037;D051549/Q000302;D051549/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D007223;D018384/Q000502;D013379;D013694	Antioxidants/metabolism;Catalysis;Child;Child, Preschool;Chromatography, Affinity;Down Syndrome/enzymology;Enzyme Activation/physiology;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Glutathione/metabolism;Glutathione S-Transferase pi/antagonists & inhibitors;Glutathione S-Transferase pi/isolation & purification;Glutathione S-Transferase pi/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Infant;Oxidative Stress/physiology;Substrate Specificity;Temperament	Hamed RR;Maharem TM;Abdel-Meguid N;Sabry GM;Abdalla AM;Guneidy RA	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.ridd.2011.01.013		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
802	21691072	Janus kinase 3 is expressed in erythrocytes, phosphorylated upon energy depletion and involved in the regulation of suicidal erythrocyte death.	Janus kinase 3, a tyrosine kinase expressed in haematopoetic tissues, plays a decisive role in T-lymphocyte survival. JAK3 deficiency leads to (Severe) Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) resulting from enhanced lymphocyte apoptosis. JAK3 is activated by phosphorylation. Nothing is known about expression of JAK3 in erythrocytes, which may undergo apoptosis-like cell death (eryptosis) characterized by cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine exposure and cell shrinkage. Triggers of eryptosis include energy depletion. The present study utilized immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy to test for JAK3 expression and phosphorylation, and FACS analysis to determine phosphatidylserine exposure (annexin binding) and cell volume (forward scatter). As a result, JAK3 was expressed in erythrocytes and phosphorylated following 24h and 48h glucose depletion. Forward scatter was slightly but significantly smaller in erythrocytes from JAK3-deficient mice (jak3(-/-)) than in erythrocytes from wild type mice (jak3(+/+)). Annexin V binding was similarly low in both genotypes. The JAK3 inhibitors WHI-P131/JANEX-1 (4-(4'-Hydroxyphenyl)amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline, 156μM) and WHI-P154 (4-[(3'-Bromo-4'-hydroxyphenyl)amino]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline, 11.2μM) did not significantly modify annexin V binding or forward scatter. Glucose depletion increased annexin V binding, an effect significantly blunted in jak3(-/-) erythrocytes and in the presence of the JAK3 inhibitors. The observations disclose a completely novel role of Janus kinase 3, i.e. the triggering of cell membrane scrambling in energy depleted erythrocytes.	eng	547	556	Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology	27	5	2011			D000255/Q000032;D000255/Q000378;D000818;D017304/Q000032;D016923/Q000187;D016923/Q000502;D048429;D004906;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D005434;D017353;D005947/Q000172;D005947/Q000494;D006801;D007150;D053616/Q000037;D053616/Q000096;D053616/Q000172;D053616/Q000235;D008297;D051379;D018345;D018613;D010718/Q000032;D010718/Q000378;D010766/Q000187;D047428/Q000494;D011799/Q000494	Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Animals;Annexin A5/analysis;Cell Death/drug effects;Cell Death/physiology;Cell Size;Erythrocyte Count;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Flow Cytometry;Gene Deletion;Glucose/deficiency;Glucose/pharmacology;Humans;Immunohistochemistry;Janus Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors;Janus Kinase 3/biosynthesis;Janus Kinase 3/deficiency;Janus Kinase 3/genetics;Male;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Microscopy, Confocal;Phosphatidylserines/analysis;Phosphatidylserines/metabolism;Phosphorylation/drug effects;Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology;Quinazolines/pharmacology	Bhavsar SK;Gu S;Bobbala D;Lang F	Journal, Articles					10.1159/000329956		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
803	21214270	Proteome analysis of erythrocytes lacking AMP-activated protein kinase reveals a role of PAK2 kinase in eryptosis.	Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) upon energy depletion stimulates energy production and limits energy utilization. Erythrocytes lacking AMPK are susceptible to suicidal cell death (eryptosis). A hallmark of eryptosis is cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine exposure at the erythrocyte surface, which can be identified from annexin V-binding. AMPKα1-deficient mice (ampk(-/-)) suffer from anemia due to accelerated clearance of erythrocytes from circulating blood. To determine the link between AMPK and the eryptotic phenotype, we performed a global proteome analysis of erythrocytes from ampk(-/-) mice and wild-type mice using high-accuracy mass spectrometry and label-free quantitation and measured changes of expression levels of 812 proteins. Notably, the p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2), previously implicated in apoptosis, was detected as downregulated in erythrocytes of ampk(-/-) mice, pointing to its potential role in eryptosis. To validate this, we showed that specific inactivation of PAK2 with the inhibitor IPA3 in human and murine ampk(+/+) erythrocytes increases the binding of annexin V and augments the stimulating effect of glucose deprivation on annexin V-binding. Inhibition of PAK2 failed to significantly modify annexin V-binding in ampk(-/-) erythrocytes, showing that AMPK and PAK2 exert similar phenotypes upon inactivation in erythrocytes. This study presents the first large-scale analysis of protein expression in erythrocytes from AMPKα1-deficient mice and reveals a role of PAK2 kinase in eryptosis.	eng	1690	1697	Journal of proteome research	10	4	2011	Apr	01	D055372/Q000235;D055372/Q000378;D000818;D016923/Q000502;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000502;D006801;D013058/Q000379;D051379;D018345;D020543/Q000032;D040901/Q000379;D054462/Q000235;D054462/Q000378	AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics;AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism;Animals;Cell Death/physiology;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/physiology;Humans;Mass Spectrometry/methods;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Proteome/analysis;Proteomics/methods;p21-Activated Kinases/genetics;p21-Activated Kinases/metabolism	Zelenak C;Föller M;Velic A;Krug K;Qadri SM;Viollet B;Lang F;Macek B	Journal, Articles					10.1021/pr101004j		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
804	21420882	Cobalt uptake and binding in human red blood cells.	The basal uptake and cytoplasmic binding of cobalt was studied in human red cells using (57)Co as tracer. The basal uptake is linear with time, at a rate of about 10 μmol (l cells)(-1) h(-1) at 100 μM [Co(2+)](o), and is almost irreversible, as there is hardly any efflux into excess EDTA. Ionophore A23187 mediates a rapid equilibration of Co(2+) across the cell membrane leading to a marked accumulation, reflecting effective cytoplasmic buffering. The fraction (α(Co)) of total cell cobalt being present as free, ionized Co(2+) is estimated at α(Co)=0.01 from the equilibrium distribution of cobalt, and also from the initial slope of the cobalt buffering curve. The cobalt accumulation is similar in fed and ATP-depleted cells. The buffering curve for [Co(T)](c) can be fitted by a Michaelis type function with B(max)=24 mmol (l cells)(-1) and half-saturation at 240 μM [Co(2+)](c). The tracer influx curves are adequately fitted by single exponentials, whereas the net influx curves all require at least double exponential fits, probably due to non-stationary A23187 kinetics. The rate of tracer influx decreases with increasing cobalt concentration, and increases with delayed addition of (57)Co tracer during net uptake. This might be explained by an 'auto-inhibition' by cobalt. The kinetics for A23187-mediated net and tracer influx of (54)Mn is very similar to that of (57)Co, whereas the net influx of (65)Zn can be fitted by single exponentials. In cobalt-loaded cells the cobalt is partly reversibly bound, being releasable by excess extracellular EGTA in the presence of A23187, and partly tightly bound, remaining in the cells even at high ionophore concentrations. The tightly bound fraction builds up over time, and is larger and develops earlier in fed cells compared to ATP-depleted cells. However, all cell cobalt appears to exchange with (57)Co during tracer influx. It is speculated that oxidation of Co(2+) to Co(3+) could lead to the high affinity binding. Tight binding is not observed in the case of (54)Mn. Tightly bound and the major part of reversibly bound (57)Co co-migrate with hemoglobin in Sephadex column chromatography of a lysate of (57)Co-loaded cells. (57)Co also co-migrates with hemoglobin when added to a lysate of unlabeled cells or to a solution of purified hemoglobin, in both cases with a time-dependent development of tight binding. Cobalt is known to bind to the globin moiety of hemoglobin. The results imply that during long-term cobalt exposure in vivo cobalt will be taken up practically irreversibly in the red cells during their 120 days life span. Thus, for biomonitoring of cobalt exposure, it could be appropriate to measure the cobalt content in red cells to give, compared with timed or in-competition whole-blood and serum analysis, an average value for the exposure over the last couple of months.	eng	266	276	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	46	4	2011	Apr	15	D001692;D000001/Q000494;D003035/Q000032;D003035/Q000493;D004781/Q000032;D004912/Q000378;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D007476;D007700;D011485	Biological Transport;Calcimycin/pharmacology;Cobalt/analysis;Cobalt/pharmacokinetics;Environmental Exposure/analysis;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Ionophores;Kinetics;Protein Binding	Simonsen LO;Brown AM;Harbak H;Kristensen BI;Bennekou P	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bcmd.2011.02.009		Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
805	21795748	Erythrocyte peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor/voltage-dependent anion channels are upregulated by Plasmodium falciparum.	"Plasmodium falciparum relies on anion channels activated in the erythrocyte membrane to ensure the transport of nutrients and waste products necessary for its replication and survival after invasion. The molecular identity of these anion channels, termed ""new permeability pathways"" is unknown, but their currents correspond to up-regulation of endogenous channels displaying complex gating and kinetics similar to those of ligand-gated channels. This report demonstrates that a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, including the voltage dependent anion channel, is present in the human erythrocyte membrane. This receptor mediates the maxi-anion currents previously described in the erythrocyte membrane. Ligands that block this peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor reduce membrane transport and conductance in P falciparum-infected erythrocytes. These ligands also inhibit in vitro intraerythrocytic growth of P falciparum. These data support the hypothesis that dormant peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors become the ""new permeability pathways"" in infected erythrocytes after up-regulation by P falciparum. These channels are obvious targets for selective inhibition in anti-malarial therapies, as well as potential routes for drug delivery in pharmacologic applications."	eng	2305	2312	Blood	118	8	2011	Aug	25	D000962/Q000494;D001570/Q000494;D003975/Q000494;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000469;D006801;D066298;D015640;D007546/Q000494;D008024;D016778/Q000097;D016778/Q000188;D016778/Q000235;D016778/Q000469;D010963/Q000187;D010963/Q000378;D010963/Q000472;D012333/Q000097;D012333/Q000235;D011963/Q000097;D011963/Q000187;D015854;D050994/Q000097;D050994/Q000235	Antimalarials/pharmacology;Benzodiazepinones/pharmacology;Diazepam/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Ion Channel Gating;Isoquinolines/pharmacology;Ligands;Malaria, Falciparum/blood;Malaria, Falciparum/drug therapy;Malaria, Falciparum/genetics;Malaria, Falciparum/parasitology;Plasmodium falciparum/drug effects;Plasmodium falciparum/metabolism;Plasmodium falciparum/pathogenicity;RNA, Messenger/blood;RNA, Messenger/genetics;Receptors, GABA-A/blood;Receptors, GABA-A/drug effects;Up-Regulation;Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels/blood;Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels/genetics	Bouyer G;Cueff A;Egée S;Kmiecik J;Maksimova Y;Glogowska E;Gallagher PG;Thomas SL	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood-2011-01-329300		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
806	21749329	Plasma levels of sphingosine 1-phosphate are strongly correlated with haematocrit, but variably restored by red blood cell transfusions.	Anaemia and RBC (red blood cell) transfusion may be associated with worse clinical outcomes, especially with longer blood storage duration prior to transfusion. The mechanisms underlying these harmful effects are unknown. RBCs have been proposed to buffer plasma S1P (sphingosine 1-phosphate), a lysophospholipid essential for the maintenance of endothelial integrity and important in the regulation of haematopoietic cell trafficking. The present study examined the effect of anaemia, RBC transfusion and RBC storage duration on plasma S1P levels. Plasma S1P from 30 individuals demonstrated a linear correlation with Hct (haematocrit; R2 = 0.51, P < 0.001) with no evidence for a plateau at Hct values as low as 19%. RBC transfusion in 23 anaemic patients with baseline mean Hct of 22.2 ± 0.34% (value is the mean ± S.D.) increased Hct to 28.3 ± 0.6% at 72 h. Despite an Hct increase, RBC transfusion failed to elevate plasma S1P consistently. A trend towards an inverse correlation was observed between RBC storage duration and the post-transfusion increase in plasma S1P. After 30 days of storage, RBC S1P decreased to 19% of that observed in fresh (3-7-day-old) RBC segments. RBC membranes contain low levels of both S1P phosphatase and S1P lyase activities that may account for the decline in S1P levels with storage. Our results support a role for RBCs in buffering plasma S1P and identify a disturbance in the capacity after transfusion. Changes in S1P content may contribute to an RBC storage lesion. Further studies should investigate the clinical significance of alterations in circulating S1P levels and the potential value of enriching stored RBCs with S1P.	eng	565	572	Clinical science (London, England : 1979)	121	12	2011	Dec		D000328;D000368;D000740/Q000097;D000740/Q000628;D001793;D017707;D004912/Q000502;D005260;D006400;D006801;D008075/Q000097;D008190/Q000097;D008246/Q000097;D008297;D008875;D010744/Q000097;D013110/Q000031;D013110/Q000097;D013997	Adult;Aged;Anemia/blood;Anemia/therapy;Blood Preservation;Erythrocyte Transfusion;Erythrocytes/physiology;Female;Hematocrit;Humans;Lipoproteins, HDL/blood;Lyases/blood;Lysophospholipids/blood;Male;Middle Aged;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/blood;Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives;Sphingosine/blood;Time Factors	Selim S;Sunkara M;Salous AK;Leung SW;Berdyshev EV;Bailey A;Campbell CL;Charnigo R;Morris AJ;Smyth SS	Journal, Articles					10.1042/CS20110236		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True

Proteomic analysis of red cells is compromised by the presence of high-abundance proteins (hemoglobin and carbonic anhydrase-1), which completely obscure low-abundance species. The depletion method presented here involves performing native gel electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel tube using a modified electroelution cell. The electrophoretic run is interrupted intermittently to allow the recovery of at least three different liquid fractions, which can be analyzed by both native PAGE and 2D isoelectric focusing SDS-PAGE, or by shotgun mass spectrometry analysis after trypsin in-solution protein digestion. This low-cost, reproducible technique can be used to process large amounts of sample, and it increases the likelihood of detecting low-abundance proteins, thereby resulting in greater proteome coverage. The separation procedure takes approximately 6-7 h.	eng	36	44	Nature protocols	7	1	2011	Dec	08	D002256/Q000737;D003600/Q000737;D004591/Q000379;D004912/Q000737;D006454/Q000737;D007525;D013058;D040901/Q000379	Carbonic Anhydrases/chemistry;Cytosol/chemistry;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/methods;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Hemoglobins/chemistry;Isoelectric Focusing;Mass Spectrometry;Proteomics/methods	D'Amici GM;Rinalducci S;Zolla L	Journal, Articles					10.1038/nprot.2011.427		red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
808	21364758	Impairment of the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocytic cycle induced by angiotensin peptides.	Plasmodium falciparum causes the most serious complications of malaria and is a public health problem worldwide with over 2 million deaths each year. The erythrocyte invasion mechanisms by Plasmodium sp. have been well described, however the physiological aspects involving host components in this process are still poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence for the role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components in reducing erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum. Angiotensin II (Ang II) reduced erythrocyte invasion in an enriched schizont culture of P. falciparum in a dose-dependent manner. Using mass spectroscopy, we showed that Ang II was metabolized by erythrocytes to Ang IV and Ang-(1-7). Parasite infection decreased Ang-(1-7) and completely abolished Ang IV formation. Similar to Ang II, Ang-(1-7) decreased the level of infection in an A779 (specific antagonist of Ang-(1-7) receptor, MAS)-sensitive manner. 10(-7) M PD123319, an AT(2) receptor antagonist, partially reversed the effects of Ang-(1-7) and Ang II. However, 10(-6) M losartan, an antagonist of the AT(1) receptor, had no effect. Gs protein is a crucial player in the Plasmodium falciparum blood cycle and angiotensin peptides can modulate protein kinase A (PKA) activity; 10(-8) M Ang II or 10(-8) M Ang-(1-7) inhibited this activity in erythrocytes by 60% and this effect was reversed by 10(-7) M A779. 10(-6) M dibutyryl-cAMP increased the level of infection and 10(-7) M PKA inhibitor decreased the level of infection by 30%. These results indicate that the effect of Ang-(1-7) on P. falciparum blood stage involves a MAS-mediated PKA inhibition. Our results indicate a crucial role for Ang II conversion into Ang-(1-7) in controlling the erythrocytic cycle of the malaria parasite, adding new functions to peptides initially described to be involved in the regulation of vascular tonus.	eng	e17174		PloS one	6	2	2011	Feb	18	D000803;D000804/Q000737;D000804/Q000494;D000804/Q000627;D000818;D002478;D004305;D004353;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000469;D006801;D008018/Q000187;D016778/Q000469;D016778/Q000517;D010446/Q000494;D010446/Q000627;D010455/Q000494;D010455/Q000627;D010963/Q000187;D010963/Q000254;D010963/Q000502;D051381;D012084/Q000187;D012084/Q000502;D052939/Q000187;D052939/Q000254	Angiotensin I;Angiotensin II/chemistry;Angiotensin II/pharmacology;Angiotensin II/therapeutic use;Animals;Cells, Cultured;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Drug Evaluation, Preclinical;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Humans;Life Cycle Stages/drug effects;Malaria, Falciparum/parasitology;Malaria, Falciparum/prevention & control;Peptide Fragments/pharmacology;Peptide Fragments/therapeutic use;Peptides/pharmacology;Peptides/therapeutic use;Plasmodium falciparum/drug effects;Plasmodium falciparum/growth & development;Plasmodium falciparum/physiology;Rats;Renin-Angiotensin System/drug effects;Renin-Angiotensin System/physiology;Schizonts/drug effects;Schizonts/growth & development	Saraiva VB;de Souza Silva L;Ferreira-DaSilva CT;da Silva-Filho JL;Teixeira-Ferreira A;Perales J;Souza MC;Henriques Md;Caruso-Neves C;de Sá Pinheiro AA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
809	20881209	The AMPKγ1 subunit plays an essential role in erythrocyte membrane elasticity, and its genetic inactivation induces splenomegaly and anemia.	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an αβγ heterotrimer conserved throughout evolution and important for energy sensing in all eukaryote cells. AMPK controls metabolism and various cellular events in response to both hormones and changes in cellular energy status. The γ subunit senses intracellular energy status through the competitive binding of AMP and ATP. We show here that targeted disruption of the mouse AMPKγ1 gene (Prkag1) causes regenerative hemolytic anemia by increasing the sequestration of abnormal erythrocytes. Prkag1(-/-) mice displayed splenomegaly and iron accumulation due to compensatory splenic erythropoiesis and erythrophagocytosis. Moreover, AMPKγ1-deficient erythrocytes were highly resistant to osmotic hemolysis and poorly deformable in response to increasing shear stress, consistent with greater membrane rigidity. No change in cytoskeletal protein composition was observed; however, the phosphorylation level of adducin, a protein promoting the binding of spectrin to actin, was higher in AMPKγ1-deficient erythrocytes. Together, these results demonstrate that AMPKγ1 subunit is required for the maintenance of erythrocyte membrane elasticity.	eng	337	347	FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology	25	1	2011	Jan		D055372/Q000235;D055372/Q000378;D000740/Q000097;D000740/Q000201;D000740/Q000235;D000743/Q000201;D000743/Q000235;D000818;D015153;D004548;D004900/Q000378;D004900/Q000473;D004906;D004907;D004910/Q000378;D005260;D006965;D007501/Q000378;D008264/Q000378;D008264/Q000473;D008297;D008565/Q000378;D051379;D057507;D008810;D018345;D013154/Q000378;D013154/Q000473;D013163/Q000097;D013163/Q000201;D013163/Q000235	AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics;AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism;Anemia/blood;Anemia/enzymology;Anemia/genetics;Anemia, Hemolytic/enzymology;Anemia, Hemolytic/genetics;Animals;Blotting, Western;Elasticity;Erythroblasts/metabolism;Erythroblasts/pathology;Erythrocyte Count;Erythrocyte Deformability;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Female;Hyperplasia;Iron/metabolism;Macrophages/metabolism;Macrophages/pathology;Male;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Mice;Mice, 129 Strain;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Spleen/metabolism;Spleen/pathology;Splenomegaly/blood;Splenomegaly/enzymology;Splenomegaly/genetics	Foretz M;Hébrard S;Guihard S;Leclerc J;Do Cruzeiro M;Hamard G;Niedergang F;Gaudry M;Viollet B	Journal, Articles					10.1096/fj.10-169383		Erythrocyte;Erythro;erythrocyte;erythro	True
810	21398593	Increases in plasma trans-EETs and blood pressure reduction in spontaneously hypertensive rats.	Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are vasodilator, natriuretic, and antiinflammatory lipid mediators. Both cis- and trans-EETs are stored in phospholipids and in red blood cells (RBCs) in the circulation; the maximal velocity (V(max)) of trans-EET hydrolysis by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is threefold that of cis-EETs. Because RBCs of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) exhibit increased sEH activity, a deficiency of trans-EETs in the SHR was hypothesized to increase blood pressure (BP). This prediction was fulfilled, since sEH inhibition with cis-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-ylureido)cyclohexyloxy]benzoic acid (AUCB; 2 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1) for 7 days) in the SHR reduced mean BP from 176 ± 8 to 153 ± 5 mmHg (P < 0.05), whereas BP in the control Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY) was unaffected. Plasma levels of EETs in the SHR were lower than in the age-matched control WKY (16.4 ± 1.6 vs. 26.1 ± 1.8 ng/ml; P < 0.05). The decrease in BP in the SHR treated with AUCB was associated with an increase in plasma EETs, which was mostly accounted for by increasing trans-EET from 4.1 ± 0.2 to 7.9 ± 1.5 ng/ml (P < 0.05). Consistent with the effect of increased plasma trans-EETs and reduced BP in the SHR, the 14,15-trans-EET was more potent (ED(50) 10(-10) M; maximum dilation 59 ± 15 μm) than the cis-isomer (ED(50) 10(-9) M; maximum dilation 30 ± 11 μm) in relaxing rat preconstricted arcuate arteries. The 11,12-EET cis- and trans-isomers were equipotent dilators as were the 8,9-EET isomers. In summary, inhibition of sEH resulted in a twofold increase in plasma trans-EETs and reduced mean BP in the SHR. The greater vasodilator potency of trans- vs. cis-EETs may contribute to the antihypertensive effects of sEH inhibitors.	eng	H1990	H1996	American journal of physiology.

811	21525805	Identification of cytosolic phosphodiesterases in the erythrocyte: a possible role for PDE5.	Within erythrocytes (RBCs), cAMP levels are regulated by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Increases in cAMP and ATP release associated with activation of β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) and prostacyclin receptors (IPRs) are regulated by PDEs 2, 4 and PDE 3, respectively. Here we establish the presence of cytosolic PDEs in RBCs and determine a role for PDE5 in regulating levels of cGMP.	eng	CR241	CR247	Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research	17	5	2011	May		D000818;D000242/Q000378;D006152/Q000494;D054684/Q000378;D054703/Q000378;D054706/Q000378;D003600/Q000187;D003600/Q000201;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007527/Q000378;D007545/Q000494;D008297;D010726/Q000494;D011688/Q000494;D011817;D013096/Q000031;D013096/Q000494;D014748/Q000494	Animals;Cyclic AMP/metabolism;Cyclic GMP/pharmacology;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3/metabolism;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4/metabolism;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 5/metabolism;Cytosol/drug effects;Cytosol/enzymology;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Isoproterenol/pharmacology;Male;Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology;Purinones/pharmacology;Rabbits;Spermine/analogs & derivatives;Spermine/pharmacology;Vinca Alkaloids/pharmacology	Adderley SP;Thuet KM;Sridharan M;Bowles EA;Stephenson AH;Ellsworth ML;Sprague RS	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
812	21508250	Functional 20S proteasomes in mature human red blood cells.	The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether functional 20S and/or 26S proteasomes are present within mature human red blood cells (RBCs; depleted of reticulocytes and leukocytes). Double-immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed the presence of immunoreactive 20S and 19S proteasomal subunit proteins and their partial co-localization within mature RBCs. Proteasomes isolated from mature RBCs displayed 20S activity in vitro; atomic-force and transmission electron microscopy of isolated proteasomes revealed abundant 20S core particles and very few 26S particles. A two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) approach was used to determine if proteasome-dependent protein degradation occurs within mature RBCs. Twenty-eight proteins were identified with altered protein content in response to lactacystin. Seven cytosolic proteins showed an increase and 16 showed a decrease; five membrane proteins showed a decrease. We conclude that the proteins showing increased abundance are either primary or secondary targets of the 20S proteasome and that putatively degraded proteins are secondary targets. Therefore, functional 20S proteasomes exist within mature RBCs. Our study did not detect 26S proteasome activity using the 2D-DIGE approach.	eng	580	591	Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)	236	5	2011	May	01	D000111/Q000031;D000111/Q000494;D001798/Q000378;D002454;D015180;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000648;D005455;D006801;D008565/Q000378;D018625;D018613;D046988/Q000302;D046988/Q000378;D061988;D013347/Q000187;D013347/Q000201	Acetylcysteine/analogs & derivatives;Acetylcysteine/pharmacology;Blood Proteins/metabolism;Cell Differentiation;Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/ultrastructure;Fluorescent Antibody Technique;Humans;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Microscopy, Atomic Force;Microscopy, Confocal;Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/isolation & purification;Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism;Proteasome Inhibitors;Subcellular Fractions/drug effects;Subcellular Fractions/enzymology	Neelam S;Kakhniashvili DG;Wilkens S;Levene SD;Goodman SR	Journal, Articles					10.1258/ebm.2011.010394		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
813	22060550	The effect of ITPA polymorphisms on the enzyme kinetic properties of human erythrocyte inosine triphosphatase toward its substrates ITP and 6-Thio-ITP.	The role of inosine triphosphatase (ITPase) in adverse drug reactions associated with thiopurine therapy is still under heavy debate. Surprisingly, little is known about the way thiopurines are handled by ITPase. We studied the effect of ITPA polymorphisms on the handling of inosine triphosphate (ITP) and thioinosine triphosphate (TITP) to gain more insight into this phenomenon. Human erythrocyte ITPase activity was measured by incubation with ITP using established protocols, and the generated inosine monophosphate (IMP) was measured using ion-pair RP-HPLC. Molecular analysis of the ITPA gene was performed to establish the genotype. Kinetic parameters were established for the two common polymorphisms for both ITP and TITP as substrates using the above mentioned protocol. Both ITP and TITP are substrates for ITPase and their enzyme activities are comparable. Substrate binding is not altered in the different ITPA polymorphisms. It is shown that the velocity of pyrophosphohydrolysis is compromised when the c.94C > A polymorphism is present, both in the heterozygous and in the homozygous state. TITP is handled by ITPase in a similar way as for ITP, which implies that TITP will accumulate in the erythrocytes of patients with an ITPase deficiency, resulting in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) on thiopurine therapy. In carriers of ITPA polymorphisms, the matter is more complex and the development of ADR may depend on additional epigenetic factors rather than on the accumulation of thiopurinenucleotides.	eng	839	849	Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids	30	11	2011	Nov		D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007293/Q000378;D011110;D011122/Q000378;D011755/Q000235;D011755/Q000378;D013379;D013868/Q000378;D000097630	Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Inosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Polymorphism, Genetic;Polyphosphates/metabolism;Pyrophosphatases/genetics;Pyrophosphatases/metabolism;Substrate Specificity;Thioinosine/metabolism;Inosine Triphosphatase	Bakker JA;Lindhout M;Habets DD;van den Wijngaard A;Paulussen AD;Bierau J	Journal, Articles					10.1080/15257770.2011.606789		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

A rapid and simple HPLC-based assay to measure ADSL activity in erythrocytes was developed. The suitability of DBSs was assessed. ADSL activity was measured in erythrocyte lysates and DBS using succinyl-AMP as the substrate. Detection and quantification were performed using isocratic ion-pairing reversed-phase HPLC with UV-detection. Reference values in erythrocyte lysates were established. The intra- and interassay variations were 2% and 8%, respectively. ADSL deficiency was easily recognized.

815	22160369	Training increases peroxiredoxin 2 contents in the erythrocytes of overweight/obese men suffering from type 2 diabetes.	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with an increased release of free radicals which play an important role in the manifestation of diabetes and in the progression of diabetic complications. Peroxiredoxins are thought to be essential components of the erythrocyte antioxidative defense. Therefore, we compared peroxiredoxin isoform contents (PRDX1-6 immuno-histochemial stainings) in the erythrocytes of overweight/obese T2DM men (n = 6) and of BMI-matched non-diabetic male control subjects (n = 6). Only erythrocyte PRDX1 and PRDX2 proteins were detectable using immunohistochemical methods. PRDX1 was significantly increased in T2DM men relative to control subjects (+95.9%, P ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, we studied the influence of a 3-month endurance training program (3 times a week, cycling at 75% maximal heart rate) on erythrocyte PRDX1 and PRDX2 contents in overweight/obese T2DM men (n = 11). Training significantly increased PRDX2 at rest (+96%, P ≤ 0.05). The up-regulation of the peroxiredoxin system may help counteract free radicals in the erythrocytes of T2DM patients.	eng	511	518	Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946)	161	21-22	2011	Nov		D000328;D000368;D003924/Q000097;D003924/Q000534;D004912/Q000378;D015444/Q000502;D005260;D005609/Q000097;D006801;D008297;D008875;D009765/Q000097;D009765/Q000534;D050177/Q000097;D050177/Q000534;D018384/Q000502;D054464/Q000097	Adult;Aged;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/rehabilitation;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Exercise/physiology;Female;Free Radicals/blood;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Obesity/blood;Obesity/rehabilitation;Overweight/blood;Overweight/rehabilitation;Oxidative Stress/physiology;Peroxiredoxins/blood	Moghaddam DA;Heber A;Capin D;Kreutz T;Opitz D;Lenzen E;Bloch W;Brixius K;Brinkmann C	Journal, Articles					10.1007/s10354-011-0037-0		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
816	21921036	Homeostasis of extracellular ATP in human erythrocytes.	We explored the intra- and extracellular processes governing the kinetics of extracellular ATP (ATPe) in human erythrocytes stimulated with agents that increase cAMP. Using the luciferin-luciferase reaction in off-line luminometry we found both direct adenylyl cyclase activation by forskolin and indirect activation through β-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol-enhanced [ATP]e in a concentration-dependent manner. A mixture (3V) containing a combination of these agents and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor papaverine activated ATP release, leading to a 3-fold increase in [ATP]e, and caused increases in cAMP concentration (3-fold for forskolin + papaverine, and 10-fold for 3V). The pannexin 1 inhibitor carbenoxolone and a pannexin 1 blocking peptide ((10)Panx1) decreased [ATP]e by 75-84%. The residual efflux of ATP resulted from unavoidable mechanical perturbations stimulating a novel, carbenoxolone-insensitive pathway. In real-time luminometry experiments using soluble luciferase, addition of 3V led to an acute increase in [ATP]e to a constant value of ∼1 pmol × (10(6) cells)(-1). A similar treatment using a surface attached luciferase (proA-luc) triggered a rapid accumulation of surface ATP levels to a peak concentration of 2.4 pmol × (10(6) cells)(-1), followed by a slower exponential decay (t(&frac12;) = 3.7 min) to a constant value of 1.3 pmol × (10(6) cells)(-1). Both for soluble luciferase and proA-luc, ATP efflux was fully blocked by carbenoxolone, pointing to a 3V-induced mechanism of ATP release mediated by pannexin 1. Ecto-ATPase activity was extremely low (∼28 fmol × (10(6) cells min)(-1)), but nevertheless physiologically relevant considering the high density of erythrocytes in human blood.	eng	38397	38407	The Journal of biological chemistry	286	44	2011	Nov	04	D000255/Q000737;D000262/Q000737;D000818;D002229/Q000737;D005576/Q000494;D000242/Q000378;D004285;D004305;D004912/Q000378;D006706;D006801;D006868;D007545/Q000494;D007700;D008156/Q000378;D008856/Q000379;D010208/Q000494;D010455/Q000737;D014981	Adenosine Triphosphate/chemistry;Adenylyl Cyclases/chemistry;Animals;Carbenoxolone/chemistry;Colforsin/pharmacology;Cyclic AMP/metabolism;Dogs;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Homeostasis;Humans;Hydrolysis;Isoproterenol/pharmacology;Kinetics;Luciferases/metabolism;Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods;Papaverine/pharmacology;Peptides/chemistry;Xenopus	Montalbetti N;Leal Denis MF;Pignataro OP;Kobatake E;Lazarowski ER;Schwarzbaum PJ	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M111.221713		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
817	21951684	Erythrocyte membrane changes of chorea-acanthocytosis are the result of altered Lyn kinase activity.	Acanthocytic RBCs are a peculiar diagnostic feature of chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc), a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. Although recent years have witnessed some progress in the molecular characterization of ChAc, the mechanism(s) responsible for generation of acanthocytes in ChAc is largely unknown. As the membrane protein composition of ChAc RBCs is similar to that of normal RBCs, we evaluated the tyrosine (Tyr)-phosphorylation profile of RBCs using comparative proteomics. Increased Tyr phosphorylation state of several membrane proteins, including band 3, β-spectrin, and adducin, was noted in ChAc RBCs. In particular, band 3 was highly phosphorylated on the Tyr-904 residue, a functional target of Lyn, but not on Tyr-8, a functional target of Syk. In ChAc RBCs, band 3 Tyr phosphorylation by Lyn was independent of the canonical Syk-mediated pathway. The ChAc-associated alterations in RBC membrane protein organization appear to be the result of increased Tyr phosphorylation leading to altered linkage of band 3 to the junctional complexes involved in anchoring the membrane to the cytoskeleton as supported by coimmunoprecipitation of β-adducin with band 3 only in ChAc RBC-membrane treated with the Lyn-inhibitor PP2. We propose this altered association between membrane skeleton and membrane proteins as novel mechanism in the generation of acanthocytes in ChAc.	eng	5652	5663	Blood	118	20	2011	Nov	17	D000050/Q000201;D000050/Q000473;D000328;D001457/Q000378;D003598/Q000378;D003599/Q000378;D004789/Q000502;D004910/Q000201;D004910/Q000473;D005260;D006801;D047908/Q000378;D008297;D008875;D054546/Q000378;D054546/Q000473;D010766/Q000502;D011505/Q000378;D040901;D000072377;D014443/Q000378;D019061/Q000378	Acanthocytes/enzymology;Acanthocytes/pathology;Adult;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism;Cytoskeleton/metabolism;Enzyme Activation/physiology;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/pathology;Female;Humans;Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism;Male;Middle Aged;Neuroacanthocytosis/metabolism;Neuroacanthocytosis/pathology;Phosphorylation/physiology;Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism;Proteomics;Syk Kinase;Tyrosine/metabolism;src-Family Kinases/metabolism	De Franceschi L;Tomelleri C;Matte A;Brunati AM;Bovee-Geurts PH;Bertoldi M;Lasonder E;Tibaldi E;Danek A;Walker RH;Jung HH;Bader B;Siciliano A;Ferru E;Mohandas N;Bosman GJ	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood-2011-05-355339		RBC;Erythrocyte	True
818	21948947	Elevated intracellular Ca2+ reveals a functional membrane nucleotide pool in intact human red blood cells.	Elevated intracellular calcium generates rapid, profound, and irreversible changes in the nucleotide metabolism of human red blood cells (RBCs), triggered by the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of the powerful plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA). In the absence of glycolytic substrates, Ca(2+)-induced nucleotide changes are thought to be determined by the interaction between PMCA ATPase, adenylate kinase, and AMP-deaminase enzymes, but the extent to which this three-enzyme system can account for the Ca(2+)-induced effects has not been investigated in detail before. Such a study requires the formulation of a model incorporating the known kinetics of the three-enzyme system and a direct comparison between its predictions and precise measurements of the Ca(2+)-induced nucleotide changes, a precision not available from earlier studies. Using state-of-the-art high-performance liquid chromatography, we measured the changes in the RBC contents of ATP, ADP, AMP, and IMP during the first 35 min after ionophore-induced pump-saturating Ca(2+) loads in the absence of glycolytic substrates. Comparison between measured and model-predicted changes revealed that for good fits it was necessary to assume mean ATPase V(max) values much higher than those ever measured by PMCA-mediated Ca(2+) extrusion. These results suggest that the local nucleotide concentrations generated by ATPase activity at the inner membrane surface differed substantially from those measured in bulk cell extracts, supporting previous evidence for the existence of a submembrane microdomain with a distinct nucleotide metabolism.	eng	381	391	The Journal of general physiology	138	4	2011	Oct		D002118/Q000378;D002462/Q000378;D002478;D002851;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D006019;D006801;D008954;D009711/Q000097;D009711/Q000378	Calcium/metabolism;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Cells, Cultured;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycolysis;Humans;Models, Biological;Nucleotides/blood;Nucleotides/metabolism	Tiffert T;Lew VL	Journal, Articles					10.1085/jgp.201110660		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
819	21844189	Intracellular erythrocyte platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase I inactivates aspirin in blood.	Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) prophylaxis suppresses major adverse cardiovascular events, but its rapid turnover limits inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase activity and thrombosis. Despite its importance, the identity of the enzyme(s) that hydrolyzes the acetyl residue of circulating aspirin, which must be an existing enzyme, remains unknown. We find that circulating aspirin was extensively hydrolyzed within erythrocytes, and chromatography indicated these cells contained a single hydrolytic activity. Purification by over 1400-fold and sequencing identified the PAFAH1B2 and PAFAH1B3 subunits of type I platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase, a phospholipase A(2) with selectivity for acetyl residues of PAF, as a candidate for aspirin acetylhydrolase. Western blotting showed that catalytic PAFAH1B2 and PAFAH1B3 subunits of the type I enzyme co-migrated with purified erythrocyte aspirin hydrolytic activity. Recombinant PAFAH1B2, but not its family member plasma PAF acetylhydrolase, hydrolyzed aspirin, and PAF competitively inhibited aspirin hydrolysis by purified or recombinant erythrocyte enzymes. Aspirin was hydrolyzed by HEK cells transfected with PAFAH1B2 or PAFAH1B3, and the competitive type I PAF acetylhydrolase inhibitor NaF reduced erythrocyte hydrolysis of aspirin. Exposing aspirin to erythrocytes blocked its ability to inhibit thromboxane A(2) synthesis and platelet aggregation. Not all individuals or populations are equally protected by aspirin prophylaxis, the phenomenon of aspirin resistance, and erythrocyte hydrolysis of aspirin varied 3-fold among individuals, which correlated with PAFAH1B2 and not PAFAH1B3. We conclude that intracellular type I PAF acetylhydrolase is the major aspirin hydrolase of human blood.	eng	34820	34829	The Journal of biological chemistry	286	40	2011	Oct	07	D043203/Q000097;D043203/Q000235;D043203/Q000378;D000595;D001241/Q000494;D002265/Q000378;D002845/Q000379;D002850;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000187;D006801;D006868;D007700;D013058/Q000379;D008869/Q000097;D008869/Q000235;D015233;D008969;D014357/Q000737	1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase/blood;1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase/genetics;1-Alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine Esterase/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Aspirin/pharmacology;Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism;Chromatography/methods;Chromatography, Gel;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Humans;Hydrolysis;Kinetics;Mass Spectrometry/methods;Microtubule-Associated Proteins/blood;Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics;Models, Statistical;Molecular Sequence Data;Trypsin/chemistry	Zhou G;Marathe GK;Willard B;McIntyre TM	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M111.267161		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
820	22415086	Protein kinase CK1α regulates erythrocyte survival.	Protein kinase CK1 (casein kinase 1) isoforms are involved in the regulation of various physiological functions including apoptosis. The specific CK1 inhibitor D4476 may either inhibit or foster apoptosis. Similar to apoptosis of nucleated cells, eryptosis, the suicidal death of erythrocytes, is paralleled by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface. Triggers of eryptosis include increase of cytosolic Ca(2+) activity following energy depletion (removal of glucose) or oxidative stress (exposure to the oxidant tert-butyl hydroperoxide [TBOOH]). Western blotting was utilized to verify that erythrocytes express the protein kinase CK1α, and FACS analysis to determine whether the CK1 inhibitor D4476 and CK1α activator pyrvinium pamoate modify forward scatter (reflecting cell volume), annexin V binding (reflecting phosphatidylserine exposure), and Fluo3 fluorescence (reflecting cytosolic Ca(2+) activity). As a result, both, human and murine erythrocytes express CK1 isoform α. Glucose depletion (48 hours) and exposure to 0.3 mM TBOOH (30 minutes) both decreased forward scatter, increased annexin V binding and increased Fluo3 fluorescence. CK1 inhibitor D4476 (10 μM) significantly blunted the decrease in forward scatter, the increase in annexin V binding and the increase in Fluo 3 fluorescence. (R)-DRF053, another CK1 inhibitor, similarly blunted the increase in annexin V binding upon glucose depletion. The CK1α specific activator pyrvinium pamoate (10 μM) significantly enhanced the increase in annexin V binding and Fluo3 fluorescence upon glucose depletion and TBOOH exposure. In the presence of glucose, pyrvinium pamoate slightly but significantly increased Fluo3 fluorescence. In conclusion, CK1 isoform α participates in the regulation of erythrocyte programmed cell death by modulating cytosolic Ca(2+) activity.	eng	171	180	Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology	29	1-2	2012			D000814/Q000737;D000818;D017304/Q000378;D017209/Q000187;D001549/Q000494;D002118/Q000378;D048128/Q000037;D048128/Q000378;D048429/Q000187;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005947/Q000494;D006801;D007093/Q000494;D051379;D010718/Q000494;D011774/Q000494;D014966/Q000737;D020122/Q000494	Aniline Compounds/chemistry;Animals;Annexin A5/metabolism;Apoptosis/drug effects;Benzamides/pharmacology;Calcium/metabolism;Casein Kinase Ialpha/antagonists & inhibitors;Casein Kinase Ialpha/metabolism;Cell Size/drug effects;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose/pharmacology;Humans;Imidazoles/pharmacology;Mice;Phosphatidylserines/pharmacology;Pyrvinium Compounds/pharmacology;Xanthenes/chemistry;tert-Butylhydroperoxide/pharmacology	Zelenak C;Eberhard M;Jilani K;Qadri SM;Macek B;Lang F	Journal, Articles					10.1159/000337598		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
821	22655043	Shifting the paradigm: the putative mitochondrial protein ABCB6 resides in the lysosomes of cells and in the plasma membrane of erythrocytes.	ABCB6, a member of the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, has been proposed to be responsible for the mitochondrial uptake of porphyrins. Here we show that ABCB6 is a glycoprotein present in the membrane of mature erythrocytes and in exosomes released from reticulocytes during the final steps of erythroid maturation. Consistent with its presence in exosomes, endogenous ABCB6 is localized to the endo/lysosomal compartment, and is absent from the mitochondria of cells. Knock-down studies demonstrate that ABCB6 function is not required for de novo heme biosynthesis in differentiating K562 cells, excluding this ABC transporter as a key regulator of porphyrin synthesis. We confirm the mitochondrial localization of ABCB7, ABCB8 and ABCB10, suggesting that only three ABC transporters should be classified as mitochondrial proteins. Taken together, our results challenge the current paradigm linking the expression and function of ABCB6 to mitochondria.	eng	e37378		PloS one	7	5	2012			D018528/Q000032;D018528/Q000235;D018528/Q000378;D002454;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D041905/Q000166;D041905/Q000378;D055354/Q000378;D015870;D055785;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D020014;D008247/Q000378;D008928/Q000378;D024101/Q000032;D024101/Q000235;D024101/Q000378	ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism;Cell Differentiation;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythroid Cells/cytology;Erythroid Cells/metabolism;Exosomes/metabolism;Gene Expression;Gene Knockdown Techniques;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;K562 Cells;Lysosomes/metabolism;Mitochondria/metabolism;Mitochondrial Proteins/analysis;Mitochondrial Proteins/genetics;Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism	Kiss K;Brozik A;Kucsma N;Toth A;Gera M;Berry L;Vallentin A;Vial H;Vidal M;Szakacs G	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;Erythro;erythrocyte;erythro	True
822	23177986	H(+)-coupled divalent metal-ion transporter-1: functional properties, physiological roles and therapeutics.	Divalent metal-ion transporter-1 (DMT1) is a widely expressed, iron-preferring membrane transport protein. Animal models establish that DMT1 plays indispensable roles in intestinal nonheme-iron absorption and iron acquisition by erythroid precursor cells. Rare mutations in human DMT1 result in severe microcytic-hypochromic anemia. When we express DMT1 in RNA-injected Xenopus oocytes, we observe rheogenic Fe(2+) transport that is driven by the proton electrochemical potential gradient. In that same preparation, DMT1 also transports cadmium and manganese but not copper. Whether manganese metabolism relies upon DMT1 remains unclear but DMT1 contributes to the effects of overexposure to cadmium and manganese in some tissues. There exist at least four DMT1 isoforms that arise from variant transcription of the SLC11A2 gene. Whereas these isoforms display identical functional properties, N- and C-terminal variations contain cues that direct the cell-specific targeting of DMT1 isoforms to discrete subcellular compartments (plasma membrane, endosomes, and lysosomes). An iron-responsive element (IRE) in the mRNA 3'-untranslated region permits the regulation of some isoforms by iron status, and additional mechanisms by which DMT1 is regulated are emerging. Natural-resistance-associated macrophage protein-1 (NRAMP1)-the only other member of the mammalian SLC11 gene family-contributes to antimicrobial function by extruding from the phagolysosome divalent metal ions (e.g. Mn(2+)) that may be essential cofactors for bacteria-derived enzymes or required for bacterial growth. The principal or only intestinal nonheme-iron transporter, DMT1 is a validated therapeutic target in hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) and other iron-overload disorders.	eng	169	214	Current topics in membranes	70		2012			D000818;D027682/Q000737;D027682/Q000235;D027682/Q000378;D006432/Q000378;D006801;D007501/Q000378;D019190/Q000235;D019190/Q000378;D035925/Q000737;D035925/Q000235;D035925/Q000378;D008345/Q000378;D023421;D009154;D012333/Q000378;D013329;D014981	Animals;Cation Transport Proteins/chemistry;Cation Transport Proteins/genetics;Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism;Hemochromatosis/metabolism;Humans;Iron/metabolism;Iron Overload/genetics;Iron Overload/metabolism;Iron-Regulatory Proteins/chemistry;Iron-Regulatory Proteins/genetics;Iron-Regulatory Proteins/metabolism;Manganese/metabolism;Models, Animal;Mutation;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Structure-Activity Relationship;Xenopus	Shawki A;Knight PB;Maliken BD;Niespodzany EJ;Mackenzie B	Journal, Articles					10.1016/B978-0-12-394316-3.00005-3		erythro	True
823	22227296	Chorein-sensitive polymerization of cortical actin and suicidal cell death in chorea-acanthocytosis.	Chorea-acanthocytosis is an inevitably lethal genetic disease characterized by a progressive hyperkinetic movement disorder and cognitive and behavioral abnormalities as well as acanthocytosis. The disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the gene encoding vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13A (VPS13A) or chorein, a protein with unknown function expressed in various cell types. How chorein deficiency leads to the pathophysiology of chorea-acanthocytosis remains enigmatic. Here we show decreased phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-p85-subunit phosphorylation, ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) activity, and p21 protein-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) phosphorylation as well as depolymerized cortical actin in erythrocytes from patients with chorea-acanthocytosis and in K562-erythrocytic cells following chorein silencing. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K, Rac1, or PAK1 similarly triggered actin depolymerization. Moreover, in K562 cells, both chorein silencing and PAK1 inhibition with IPA-3 decreased phosphorylation of Bad, a Bcl2-associated protein, promoting apoptosis by forming mitochondrial pores, followed by mitochondrial depolarization, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface, all hallmarks of apoptosis. Our observations reveal chorein as a novel powerful regulator of cytoskeletal architecture and cell survival, thus explaining erythrocyte misshape and possibly neurodegeneration in chorea-acanthocytosis.	eng	1526	1534	FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology	26	4	2012	Apr		D000050/Q000166;D000050/Q000378;D000199/Q000378;D000328;D000368;D000818;D017209/Q000502;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D020868;D006801;D020014;D008297;D008875;D009154;D054546/Q000235;D054546/Q000473;D054546/Q000503;D019869/Q000235;D019869/Q000378;D033921/Q000235;D033921/Q000378;D055815;D051025/Q000235;D051025/Q000378;D054462/Q000235;D054462/Q000378;D020830/Q000235;D020830/Q000378	Acanthocytes/cytology;Acanthocytes/metabolism;Actins/metabolism;Adult;Aged;Animals;Apoptosis/physiology;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Gene Silencing;Humans;K562 Cells;Male;Middle Aged;Mutation;Neuroacanthocytosis/genetics;Neuroacanthocytosis/pathology;Neuroacanthocytosis/physiopathology;Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics;Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism;Vesicular Transport Proteins/genetics;Vesicular Transport Proteins/metabolism;Young Adult;bcl-Associated Death Protein/genetics;bcl-Associated Death Protein/metabolism;p21-Activated Kinases/genetics;p21-Activated Kinases/metabolism;rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/genetics;rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism	Föller M;Hermann A;Gu S;Alesutan I;Qadri SM;Borst O;Schmidt EM;Schiele F;vom Hagen JM;Saft C;Schöls L;Lerche H;Stournaras C;Storch A;Lang F	Journal, Articles					10.1096/fj.11-198317		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
824	22389252	Chemical activation of a high-affinity glutamate transporter in human erythrocytes and its implications for malaria-parasite-induced glutamate uptake.	"Human erythrocytes have a low basal permeability to L-glutamate and are not known to have a functional glutamate transporter. Here, treatment of human erythrocytes with arsenite was shown to induce the uptake of L-glutamate and D-aspartate, but not that of D-glutamate or L-alanine. The majority of the arsenite-induced L-glutamate influx was via a high-affinity, Na(+)-dependent system showing characteristics of members of the ""excitatory amino acid transporter"" (EAAT) family. Western blots and immunofluorescence assays revealed the presence of a member of this family, EAAT3, on the erythrocyte membrane. Erythrocytes infected with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum take up glutamate from the extracellular environment. Although the majority of uptake is via a low-affinity Na(+)-independent pathway there is, in addition, a high-affinity uptake component, raising the possibility that the parasite activates the host cell glutamate transporter."	eng	3604	3612	Blood	119	15	2012	Apr	12	D000777/Q000494;D018053/Q000494;D002462/Q000187;D002462/Q000378;D002478;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000469;D050580/Q000819;D050580/Q000378;D018698/Q000378;D018698/Q000493;D018698/Q000494;D006790/Q000502;D006801;D016778/Q000097;D016778/Q000378;D016778/Q000469;D010963/Q000502;D011277/Q000494;D013268;D013723/Q000494	Anesthetics/pharmacology;Arsenites/pharmacology;Cell Membrane/drug effects;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Cells, Cultured;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 3/agonists;Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 3/metabolism;Glutamic Acid/metabolism;Glutamic Acid/pharmacokinetics;Glutamic Acid/pharmacology;Host-Parasite Interactions/physiology;Humans;Malaria, Falciparum/blood;Malaria, Falciparum/metabolism;Malaria, Falciparum/parasitology;Plasmodium falciparum/physiology;Pregnanediones/pharmacology;Stimulation, Chemical;Teratogens/pharmacology	Winterberg M;Rajendran E;Baumeister S;Bietz S;Kirk K;Lingelbach K	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood-2011-10-386003		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
825	22367507	Role of the human erythrocyte in generation and storage of asymmetric dimethylarginine.	Proteolytic activity in whole blood may lead to release of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). We investigated the role of the human erythrocyte in storage and generation of ADMA in healthy controls (n = 36) and critically ill patients (n = 38). Both free and total (sum of free and protein-incorporated) ADMA were measured. Upon incubation of intact erythrocytes with extracellular ADMA (0 to 40 μmol/l), equilibrium between intra- and extracellular ADMA was reached within 3 h. Compared with controls, patients had significantly higher basal concentrations of ADMA in plasma (0.88 ± 0.75 vs. 0.41 ± 0.07 μmol/l) and erythrocytes (1.28 ± 0.55 vs. 0.57 ± 0.14 μmol/l). Intracellular and plasma ADMA were significantly correlated in the patient group only (r = 0.834). Upon lysis, followed by incubation at 37°C for 2 h, free ADMA increased sevenfold (to 8.60 ± 3.61 μmol/l in patients and 3.90 ± 0.78 μmol/l in controls). In lysates of controls, free ADMA increased further to 9.85 ± 1.35 μmol/l after 18 h. Total ADMA was 15.43 ± 2.44 μmol/l and did not change during incubation. The increase of free ADMA during incubation corresponded to substantial release of ADMA from the erythrocytic protein-incorporated pool (21.9 ± 4.6% at 2 h and 60.8 ± 7.6% at 18 h). ADMA was released from proteins other than hemoglobin, which only occurred after complete lysis and was blocked by combined inhibition of proteasomal and protease activity. Neither intact nor lysed erythrocytes mediated degradation of free ADMA. We conclude that intact erythrocytes play an important role in storage of ADMA, whereas upon erythrocyte lysis large amounts of free ADMA are generated by proteolysis of methylated proteins, which may affect plasma levels in hemolysis-associated diseases.	eng	H1762	H1770	American journal of physiology.

826	22178722	The red blood cell participates in regulation of the circulation by producing and releasing epoxyeicosatrienoic acids.	Red blood cells (RBCs) have an important function in regulation of the circulation by producing and releasing epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) in response to a low O₂ environment such as encountered in the cardiac microcirculation during exercise. RBCs, in their role as sensors of low pO₂, release ATP and critical lipid mediators, the EETs. Both cis- and trans-EETs are synthesized and stored in RBCs and are hydrolyzed by soluble epoxide hydrolases (sEH). The trans-EETs differ from cis-EETs in their higher vascular potencies and more rapid metabolism by sEH. Thus, inhibition of sEH results in greater trans-EET levels and increased positive vascular effects of trans-EETs vs cis-EETs. The trans-EETs are responsible for a significant decline in the elevated blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat on treatment with a sEH inhibitor to raise EET levels. We predict that trans-EETs and cis-EETs will occupy important therapeutic roles in a broad spectrum of diseases and abnormal physiological conditions such as that resulting from high salt intake and hypertension.	eng	91	93	Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators	98	3-4	2012	Aug		D000818;D001794/Q000502;D015777/Q000096;D015777/Q000737;D015777/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006868;D006973/Q000503;D008833/Q000502	Animals;Blood Pressure/physiology;Eicosanoids/biosynthesis;Eicosanoids/chemistry;Eicosanoids/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrolysis;Hypertension/physiopathology;Microcirculation/physiology	Jiang H;Anderson GD;McGiff JC	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2011.11.008		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;Red blood cell	True

828	22954596	A label-free proteome analysis strategy for identifying quantitative changes in erythrocyte membranes induced by red cell disorders.	Red blood cells have been extensively studied but many questions regarding membrane properties and pathophysiology remain unanswered. Proteome analysis of red cell membranes is complicated by a very wide dynamic range of protein concentrations as well as the presence of proteins that are very large, very hydrophobic, or heterogeneously glycosylated. This study investigated the removal of other blood cell types, red cell membrane extraction, differing degrees of fractionation using 1-D SDS gels, and label-free quantitative methods to determine optimized conditions for proteomic comparisons of clinical blood samples. The results showed that fractionation of red cell membranes on 1-D SDS gels was more efficient than low-ionic-strength extractions followed by 1-D gel fractionation. When gel lanes were sliced into 30 uniform slices, a good depth of analysis that included the identification of most well-characterized, low-abundance red cell membrane proteins including those present at 500 to 10,000 copies per cell was obtained. Furthermore, the size separation enabled detection of changes due to proteolysis or in vivo protein crosslinking. A combination of Rosetta Elucidator quantitation and subsequent statistical analysis enabled the robust detection of protein differences that could be used to address unresolved questions in red cell disorders.

829	22147898	Erythrocyte plasma membrane-bound ERK1/2 activation promotes ICAM-4-mediated sickle red cell adhesion to endothelium.	The core pathology of sickle cell disease (SCD) starts with the erythrocyte (RBC). Aberration in MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling, which can regulate cell adhesion, occurs in diverse pathologies. Because RBCs contain abundant ERK1/2, we predicted that ERK1/2 is functional in sickle (SS) RBCs and promotes adherence, a hallmark of SCD. ERK1/2 remained active in SS but not normal RBCs. β(2)-adrenergic receptor stimulation by epinephrine can enhance ERK1/2 activity only in SS RBCs via PKA- and tyrosine kinase p72(syk)-dependent pathways. ERK signaling is implicated in RBC ICAM-4 phosphorylation, promoting SS RBC adhesion to the endothelium. SS RBC adhesion and phosphorylation of both ERK and ICAM-4 all decreased with continued cell exposure to epinephrine, implying that activation of ICAM-4-mediated SS RBC adhesion is temporally associated with ERK1/2 activation. Furthermore, recombinant ERK2 phosphorylated α- and β-adducins and dematin at the ERK consensus motif. Cytoskeletal protein 4.1 also showed dynamic phosphorylation but not at the ERK consensus motif. These results demonstrate that ERK activation induces phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins and the adhesion molecule ICAM-4, promoting SS RBC adhesion to the endothelium. Thus, blocking RBC ERK1/2 activation, such as that promoted by catecholamine stress hormones, could ameliorate SCD pathophysiology.	eng	1217	1227	Blood	119	5	2012	Feb	02	D016475;D000755/Q000097;D000755/Q000378;D000755/Q000473;D000818;D002448;D015815/Q000378;D015815/Q000502;D002462/Q000378;D002478;D004730/Q000378;D004730/Q000502;D004789/Q000502;D004910/Q000378;D004913/Q000378;D004913/Q000473;D004913/Q000502;D061307/Q000378;D061307/Q000473;D061307/Q000502;D006801;D020935/Q000502;D051379;D019950/Q000378;D019950/Q000502;D048052/Q000378;D048052/Q000502;D008954;D061251	3T3 Cells;Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood;Anemia, Sickle Cell/metabolism;Anemia, Sickle Cell/pathology;Animals;Cell Adhesion;Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism;Cell Adhesion Molecules/physiology;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Cells, Cultured;Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism;Endothelium, Vascular/physiology;Enzyme Activation/physiology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes, Abnormal/metabolism;Erythrocytes, Abnormal/pathology;Erythrocytes, Abnormal/physiology;Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/metabolism;Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/pathology;Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/physiology;Humans;MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology;Mice;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/physiology;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/physiology;Models, Biological;Primary Cell Culture	Zennadi R;Whalen EJ;Soderblom EJ;Alexander SC;Thompson JW;Dubois LG;Moseley MA;Telen MJ	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood-2011-03-344440		erythrocyte;Erythrocyte;RBC;red cell	True

832	22824271	Accumulated bending energy elicits neutral sphingomyelinase activity in human red blood cells.	We propose that accumulated membrane bending energy elicits a neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) activity in human erythrocytes. Membrane bending was achieved by osmotic or chemical processes, and SMase activity was assessed by quantitative thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The activity induced by hypotonic stress in erythrocyte membranes had the pH dependence, ion dependence, and inhibitor sensitivity of mammalian neutral SMases. The activity caused a decrease in SM contents, with a minimum at 6 min after onset of the hypotonic conditions, and then the SM contents were recovered. We also elicited SMase activity by adding lysophosphatidylcholine externally or by generating it with phospholipase A(2). The same effect was observed upon addition of chlorpromazine or sodium deoxycholate at concentrations below the critical micellar concentration, and even under hypertonic conditions. A unifying factor of the various agents that elicit this SMase activity is the accumulated membrane bending energy. Both hypo-and hypertonic conditions impose an increased curvature, whereas the addition of surfactants or phospholipase A(2) activation increases the outer monolayer area, thus leading to an increased bending energy. The fact that this latent SMase activity is tightly coupled to the membrane bending properties suggests that it may be related to the general phenomenon of stress-induced ceramide synthesis and apoptosis.	eng	2077	2085	Biophysical journal	102	9	2012	May	02	D002478;D004735/Q000502;D004789;D004910/Q000502;D004910/Q000648;D006801;D008560/Q000502;D008563/Q000502;D013108/Q000737;D013108/Q000648	Cells, Cultured;Energy Transfer/physiology;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocyte Membrane/physiology;Erythrocyte Membrane/ultrastructure;Humans;Membrane Fluidity/physiology;Membrane Lipids/physiology;Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/chemistry;Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/ultrastructure	López DJ;Egido-Gabas M;López-Montero I;Busto JV;Casas J;Garnier M;Monroy F;Larijani B;Goñi FM;Alonso A	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bpj.2012.03.020		Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True

The aim of this study was to resolve this discrepancy.	eng	883	891	Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology	31	6	2013			D060848/Q000494;D000814/Q000737;D002118/Q000378;D020864/Q000737;D020864/Q000378;D020013/Q000187;D002462/Q000187;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005434;D006461;D006801;D007211/Q000494;D007700;D008246/Q000494;D008301/Q000494;D010718/Q000494;D051571/Q000037;D051571/Q000378;D013755/Q000031;D013755/Q000494;D014966/Q000737	Agatoxins/pharmacology;Aniline Compounds/chemistry;Calcium/metabolism;Calcium Channels, N-Type/chemistry;Calcium Channels, N-Type/metabolism;Calcium Signaling/drug effects;Cell Membrane/drug effects;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Flow Cytometry;Hemolysis;Humans;Indoles/pharmacology;Kinetics;Lysophospholipids/pharmacology;Maleimides/pharmacology;Phosphatidylserines/pharmacology;Protein Kinase C-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors;Protein Kinase C-alpha/metabolism;Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/analogs & derivatives;Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology;Xanthenes/chemistry	Wagner-Britz L;Wang J;Kaestner L;Bernhardt I	Journal, Articles					10.1159/000350106		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
834	24039907	Association between polymorphisms in glutathione peroxidase and selenoprotein P genes, glutathione peroxidase activity, HRT use and breast cancer risk.	Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers in women. Evidence suggests that genetic variation in antioxidant enzymes could influence BC risk, but to date the relationship between selenoproteins and BC risk remains unclear. In this report, a study population including 975 Danish cases and 975 controls matched for age and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use was genotyped for five functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SEPP1, GPX1, GPX4 and the antioxidant enzyme SOD2 genes. The influence of genetic polymorphisms on breast cancer risk was assessed using conditional logistic regression. Additionally pre-diagnosis erythrocyte GPx (eGPx) activity was measured in a sub-group of the population. A 60% reduction in risk of developing overall BC and ductal BC was observed in women who were homozygous Thr carriers for SEPP1 rs3877899. Additionally, Leu carriers for GPX1 Pro198Leu polymorphism (rs1050450) were at ∼2 fold increased risk of developing a non-ductal BC. Pre-diagnosis eGPx activity was found to depend on genotype for rs713041 (GPX4), rs3877899 (SEPP1), and rs1050450 (GPX1) and on HRT use. Moreover, depending on genotype and HRT use, eGPx activity was significantly lower in women who developed BC later in life compared with controls. Furthermore, GPx1 protein levels increased in human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cells exposed to β-estradiol and sodium selenite.In conclusion, our data provide evidence that SNPs in SEPP1 and GPX1 modulate risk of BC and that eGPx activity is modified by SNPs in SEPP1, GPX4 and GPX1 and by estrogens. Our data thus suggest a role of selenoproteins in BC development.	eng	e73316		PloS one	8	9	2013			D001943/Q000453;D001943/Q000235;D001943/Q000378;D045744;D005260;D005838;D005979/Q000235;D005979/Q000378;D020249/Q000009;D006801;D008875;D000080662;D020641;D012307;D051149/Q000235;D013482/Q000235	Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology;Breast Neoplasms/genetics;Breast Neoplasms/metabolism;Cell Line, Tumor;Female;Genotype;Glutathione Peroxidase/genetics;Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism;Hormone Replacement Therapy/adverse effects;Humans;Middle Aged;Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Risk Factors;Selenoprotein P/genetics;Superoxide Dismutase/genetics	Méplan C;Dragsted LO;Ravn-Haren G;Tjønneland A;Vogel U;Hesketh J	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
835	24094238	A review of the JR blood group system.	The JR blood group system (ISBT 032) consists of one antigen,Jra, which is of high prevalence in all populations. The rare Jr(a-) phenotype has been found mostly in Japanese and other Asian populations, but also in people of northern European ancestry, in Bedouin Arabs, and in one Mexican. Anti-Jra has caused transfusion reactions and is involved in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. The Jra antigen is located on ABCG2 transporter, a multipass membrane glycoprotein (also known as the breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP), which is encoded by the ABCG2 gene on chromosome 4q22.1. The Jr(a-) phenotype mostly results from recessive inheritance of ABCG2 null alleles caused by frameshift or nonsense changes.	eng	63	68	Immunohematology	29	2	2013			D000070997;D018528/Q000235;D018528/Q000276;D018528/Q000378;D000483;D001789/Q000097;D001789/Q000235;D001789/Q000276;D002894/Q000235;D002894/Q000378;D004899/Q000097;D004899/Q000235;D004899/Q000276;D006801;D007518/Q000097;D007518/Q000235;D007518/Q000276;D009363/Q000235;D009363/Q000276;D009363/Q000378	ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/immunology;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism;Alleles;Blood Group Antigens/blood;Blood Group Antigens/genetics;Blood Group Antigens/immunology;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/metabolism;Erythroblastosis, Fetal/blood;Erythroblastosis, Fetal/genetics;Erythroblastosis, Fetal/immunology;Humans;Isoantibodies/blood;Isoantibodies/genetics;Isoantibodies/immunology;Neoplasm Proteins/genetics;Neoplasm Proteins/immunology;Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism	Castilho L;Reid ME	Journal, Articles							Erythro	True
836	23781972	Native protein complexes in the cytoplasm of red blood cells.	Despite decades of advancements, the investigation of the red blood cell (RBC) cytosolic proteome still represents a challenging task because of the overwhelming abundance of hemoglobin. Besides, the separation method is one of the main limiting factors when investigating protein complexes. In this study, we performed for the first time a 2D-clear native (CN)-SDS-PAGE followed by mass spectrometry-based identification to screen multiprotein complexes (MCPs) in the cytosol of human RBCs. Upstream to 2D-CN-SDS-PAGE, we applied a recently developed native pre-enrichment strategy that allows discriminating and separately collecting three distinct fractions, one of which is highly enriched for hemoglobin. Such prefractionation strategy is conservative, in that it makes soluble native-complex analyses amenable without loss of biological information. Because of the resolution of native gel electrophoresis techniques, we could observe and describe 55 potential hetero-oligomeric MPCs from the RBC native cytosolic proteome, among which ultratetrameric hemoglobin. The detected protein complexes were characterized by proteins mainly involved in oxygen transport, antioxidant responses, metabolism, and protein degradation cascades, in agreement with recent in silico models. Metabolic enzyme oligomers also interacted with complexes of proteins involved in oxidative stress responses, thus suggesting a functional relationship between metabolic modulation and antioxidant defenses.	eng	3529	3546	Journal of proteome research	12	7	2013	Jul	05	D003593/Q000378;D004591;D004912/Q000378;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D007525;D013058;D046912/Q000145;D046912/Q000302;D046912/Q000378	Cytoplasm/metabolism;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Isoelectric Focusing;Mass Spectrometry;Multiprotein Complexes/classification;Multiprotein Complexes/isolation & purification;Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism	Pallotta V;D'Alessandro A;Rinalducci S;Zolla L	Journal, Articles					10.1021/pr400431b		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
837	23219802	Stomatin interacts with GLUT1/SLC2A1, band 3/SLC4A1, and aquaporin-1 in human erythrocyte membrane domains.	The widely expressed, homo-oligomeric, lipid raft-associated, monotopic integral membrane protein stomatin and its homologues are known to interact with and modulate various ion channels and transporters. Stomatin is a major protein of the human erythrocyte membrane, where it associates with and modifies the glucose transporter GLUT1; however, previous attempts to purify hetero-oligomeric stomatin complexes for biochemical analysis have failed. Because lateral interactions of membrane proteins may be short-lived and unstable, we have used in situ chemical cross-linking of erythrocyte membranes to fix the stomatin complexes for subsequent purification by immunoaffinity chromatography. To further enrich stomatin, we prepared detergent-resistant membranes either before or after cross-linking. Mass spectrometry of the isolated, high molecular, cross-linked stomatin complexes revealed the major interaction partners as glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), anion exchanger (band 3), and water channel (aquaporin-1). Moreover, ferroportin-1 (SLC40A1), urea transporter-1 (SLC14A1), nucleoside transporter (SLC29A1), the calcium-pump (Ca-ATPase-4), CD47, and flotillins were identified as stomatin-interacting proteins. These findings are in line with the hypothesis that stomatin plays a role as membrane-bound scaffolding protein modulating transport proteins.	eng	956	966	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1828	3	2013	Mar		D001457/Q000737;D001457/Q000378;D051398/Q000378;D001703/Q000379;D002846/Q000379;D003432/Q000494;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D051272/Q000737;D051272/Q000378;D006801;D013058/Q000379;D008565/Q000737;D008565/Q000378;D008954;D010455/Q000737;D011485;D025941/Q000379;D017434	Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/chemistry;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Aquaporin 1/metabolism;Biophysics/methods;Chromatography, Affinity/methods;Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Glucose Transporter Type 1/chemistry;Glucose Transporter Type 1/metabolism;Humans;Mass Spectrometry/methods;Membrane Proteins/chemistry;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Models, Biological;Peptides/chemistry;Protein Binding;Protein Interaction Mapping/methods;Protein Structure, Tertiary	Rungaldier S;Oberwagner W;Salzer U;Csaszar E;Prohaska R	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bbamem.2012.11.030		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
838	23219804	Freely turning over palmitate in erythrocyte membrane proteins is not responsible for the anchoring of lipid rafts to the spectrin skeleton: a study with bio-orthogonal chemical probes.	"Erythrocyte lipid rafts are anchored to the underlying spectrin membrane skeleton [A. Ciana, C. Achilli, C. Balduini, G. Minetti, On the association of lipid rafts to the spectrin skeleton in human erythrocytes, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1808 (2011) 183-190]. The nature of this linkage and the molecules involved are poorly understood. The interaction is sensitive to the increase in pH and ionic strength induced by carbonate. Given the role of palmitoylation in modulating the partitioning of certain proteins between various sub-cellular compartments and the plasma membrane, we asked whether palmitoylation of p55, a peripheral protein located at the junctional complex between spectrin-actin-protein 4.1 that anchors the membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer via the transmembrane protein glycophorin C, could contribute to the anchoring of lipid rafts to the membrane skeleton. We adopted a new, non-radioactive method for studying protein palmitoylation, based on bio-orthogonal chemical analogues of fatty acids, containing an omega-alkynyl group, to metabolically label cell proteins, which are then revealed by a ""click chemistry"" reaction of the alkynyl moiety with an azide-containing reporter tag. We show that the membrane localization and palmitoylation levels of p55 did not change after carbonate treatment. 2-bromopalmitate and cerulenin, two known palmitoylation inhibitors, completely inhibited p55 palmitoylation, and protein palmitoyl thioesterase-1 (PPT1) reduced it, without affecting the association between lipid rafts and membrane-skeleton, indicating, on the one hand, that p55 palmitoylation is enzymatic, and, on the other, that it is not involved in the modulation of the linkage of lipid rafts to the membrane-skeleton."	eng	924	931	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1828	3	2013	Mar		D000199/Q000737;D000480/Q000737;D000925/Q000737;D001386/Q000737;D001703/Q000379;D002569/Q000737;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D006021/Q000737;D006801;D008051/Q000737;D008055/Q000737;D054878;D021962/Q000737;D010168/Q000737;D019308/Q000737;D013049/Q000737;D013395/Q000737;D013869/Q000378	Actins/chemistry;Alkynes/chemistry;Anticoagulants/chemistry;Azides/chemistry;Biophysics/methods;Cerulenin/chemistry;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Glycophorins/chemistry;Humans;Lipid Bilayers/chemistry;Lipids/chemistry;Lipoylation;Membrane Microdomains/chemistry;Palmitates/chemistry;Palmitic Acid/chemistry;Spectrin/chemistry;Sucrose/chemistry;Thiolester Hydrolases/metabolism	Ciana A;Achilli C;Hannoush RN;Risso A;Balduini C;Minetti G	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bbamem.2012.11.029		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
839	23417980	In vitro generated Rh(null) red cells recapitulate the in vivo deficiency: a model for rare blood group phenotypes and erythroid membrane disorders.	Lentiviral modification combined with ex vivo erythroid differentiation was used to stably inhibit RhAG expression, a critical component of the Rh(rhesus) membrane complex defective in the Rh(null) syndrome. The cultured red cells generated recapitulate the major alterations of native Rh(null) cells regarding antigen expression, membrane deformability, and gas transport function, providing the proof of principle for their use as model of Rh(null) syndrome and to investigate Rh complex biogenesis in human primary erythroid cells. Using this model, we were able to reveal for the first time that RhAG extinction alone is sufficient to explain ICAM-4 and CD47 loss observed on native Rh(null) RBCs. Together with the effects of RhAG forced expression in Rh(null) progenitors, this strongly strengthens the hypothesis that RhAG is critical to Rh complex formation. The strategy is also promising for diagnosis purpose in order to overcome the supply from rare blood donors and is applicable to other erythroid defects and rare phenotypes, providing models to dissect membrane biogenesis of multicomplex proteins in erythroid cells, with potential clinical applications in transfusion medicine.	eng	343	349	American journal of hematology	88	5	2013	May		D053687/Q000166;D053687/Q000378;D000745/Q000378;D000745/Q000473;D029502/Q000378;D029502/Q000473;D001798/Q000037;D001798/Q000235;D001798/Q000378;D051928/Q000378;D015815/Q000378;D002454;D002460;D002478;D041905/Q000378;D041905/Q000473;D015672/Q000166;D015672/Q000378;D005260;D005312;D053686/Q000166;D053686/Q000378;D030342/Q000097;D030342/Q000378;D030342/Q000473;D006801;D008562/Q000037;D008562/Q000235;D008562/Q000378;D017092/Q000378;D017092/Q000473;D011247;D034622;D034741;D012156/Q000378;D012156/Q000473;D012204/Q000097;D012204/Q000378	Adult Stem Cells/cytology;Adult Stem Cells/metabolism;Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital/metabolism;Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital/pathology;Anemia, Hypoplastic, Congenital/metabolism;Anemia, Hypoplastic, Congenital/pathology;Blood Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors;Blood Proteins/genetics;Blood Proteins/metabolism;CD47 Antigen/metabolism;Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism;Cell Differentiation;Cell Line;Cells, Cultured;Erythroid Cells/metabolism;Erythroid Cells/pathology;Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology;Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism;Female;Fetal Blood;Fetal Stem Cells/cytology;Fetal Stem Cells/metabolism;Genetic Diseases, Inborn/blood;Genetic Diseases, Inborn/metabolism;Genetic Diseases, Inborn/pathology;Humans;Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors;Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics;Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism;Porphyria, Erythropoietic/metabolism;Porphyria, Erythropoietic/pathology;Pregnancy;RNA Interference;RNA, Small Interfering;Reticulocytes/metabolism;Reticulocytes/pathology;Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/blood;Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/metabolism	Cambot M;Mazurier C;Canoui-Poitrine F;Hebert N;Picot J;Clay D;Picard V;Ripoche P;Douay L;Dubart-Kupperschmitt A;Cartron JP	Journal, Articles					10.1002/ajh.23414		RBC;Erythro;red cell;erythro	True
840	23913858	Endothelin-1 receptor antagonists regulate cell surface-associated protein disulfide isomerase in sickle cell disease.	Increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels, disordered thiol protein status, and erythrocyte hydration status play important roles in sickle cell disease (SCD) through unresolved mechanisms. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is an oxidoreductase that mediates thiol/disulfide interchange reactions. We provide evidence that PDI is present in human and mouse erythrocyte membranes and that selective blockade with monoclonal antibodies against PDI leads to reduced Gardos channel activity (1.6±0.03 to 0.56±0.02 mmol·10(13) cell(-1)·min(-1), P<0.001) and density of sickle erythrocytes (D50: 1.115±0.001 to 1.104±0.001 g/ml, P=0.012) with an IC50 of 4 ng/ml. We observed that erythrocyte associated-PDI activity was increased in the presence of ET-1 (3.1±0.2 to 5.6±0.4%, P<0.0001) through a mechanism that includes casein kinase II. Consistent with these results, in vivo treatment of BERK sickle transgenic mice with ET-1 receptor antagonists lowered circulating and erythrocyte associated-PDI activity (7.1±0.3 to 5.2±0.2%, P<0.0001) while improving hematological parameters and Gardos channel activity. Thus, our results suggest that PDI is a novel target in SCD that regulates erythrocyte volume and oxidative stress and may contribute to cellular adhesion and endothelial activation leading to vasoocclusion as observed in SCD.	eng	4619	4629	FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology	27	11	2013	Nov		D000755/Q000097;D000755/Q000201;D000755/Q000378;D000818;D000911/Q000494;D000001/Q000494;D061207/Q000494;D047390/Q000037;D047390/Q000378;D002462/Q000378;D065130;D004791/Q000494;D004911/Q000187;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D051660/Q000037;D051660/Q000378;D051379;D018384;D019704/Q000037;D019704/Q000378;D013438/Q000494	Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood;Anemia, Sickle Cell/enzymology;Anemia, Sickle Cell/metabolism;Animals;Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology;Calcimycin/pharmacology;Calcium Ionophores/pharmacology;Casein Kinase II/antagonists & inhibitors;Casein Kinase II/metabolism;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Endothelin A Receptor Antagonists;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Volume/drug effects;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Intermediate-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels/antagonists & inhibitors;Intermediate-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels/metabolism;Mice;Oxidative Stress;Protein Disulfide-Isomerases/antagonists & inhibitors;Protein Disulfide-Isomerases/metabolism;Sulfhydryl Compounds/pharmacology	Prado GN;Romero JR;Rivera A	Journal, Articles					10.1096/fj.13-228577		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
841	24044898	Accumulation of altered aspartyl residues in erythrocyte membrane proteins from patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	"Spontaneous protein deamidation of labile asparagines (Asn), generating abnormal l-isoaspartyl residues (IsoAsp), is associated with cell aging and enhanced by an oxidative microenvironment. The presence of isopeptide bonds impairs protein structure/function. To minimize the damage, IsoAsp can be ""repaired"" by the protein l-isoaspartyl/d-aspartyl O-methyltransferase (PIMT) and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is the methyl donor of this reaction. PIMT is a repair enzyme that initiates the conversion of l-isoAsp (or d-Asp) residues to l-Asp residues. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease principally affecting motor neurons. The condition of oxidative stress reported in familial and sporadic forms of ALS prompted us to investigate Asn deamidation in ALS tissue. Erythrocytes (RBCs) were selected as a model system since they are unable to replace damaged proteins and protein methylesterification is virtually the only AdoMet-consuming reaction operating in these cells. Our data show that, in vitro assay, abnormal IsoAsp residues were significantly higher in ALS patients erythrocyte membrane proteins with an increased methyl accepting capability relative to controls (p<0.05). Moreover, we observed a reduction in AdoMet levels, while AdoHcy concentration was comparable to that detected in the control, resulting in a lower [AdoMet]/[AdoHcy] ratio. Then, the accumulation of altered aspartyl residues in ALS patients is probably related to a reduced efficiency of the S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent repair system causing increased protein instability at Asn sites. The increase of abnormal residues represents a new protein alteration that may be present not only in red blood cells but also in other cell types of patients suffering from ALS."	eng	626	634	Neurochemistry international	63	6	2013	Nov		D000328;D000368;D000690/Q000097;D000690/Q000150;D000690/Q000378;D001224/Q000378;D004910/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D008297;D008565/Q000378;D008715/Q000378;D008716/Q000378;D008875;D010084;D018384/Q000187;D026601/Q000378;D017382/Q000378;D012435	Adult;Aged;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/blood;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/complications;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/metabolism;Aspartic Acid/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Female;Humans;Male;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Methionine/metabolism;Methionine Adenosyltransferase/metabolism;Middle Aged;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress/drug effects;Protein D-Aspartate-L-Isoaspartate Methyltransferase/metabolism;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism;S-Adenosylhomocysteine	D'Angelo S;Trojsi F;Salvatore A;Daniele L;Raimo M;Galletti P;Monsurrò MR	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.neuint.2013.09.006		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
842	23864610	Transport of H2S and HS(-) across the human red blood cell membrane: rapid H2S diffusion and AE1-mediated Cl(-)/HS(-) exchange.	The rates of H2S and HS(-) transport across the human erythrocyte membrane were estimated by measuring rates of dissipation of pH gradients in media containing 250 μM H2S/HS(-). Net acid efflux is caused by H2S/HS(-) acting analogously to CO2/HCO3(-) in the Jacobs-Stewart cycle. The steps are as follows: 1) H2S efflux through the lipid bilayer and/or a gas channel, 2) extracellular H2S deprotonation, 3) HS(-) influx in exchange for Cl(-), catalyzed by the anion exchange protein AE1, and 4) intracellular HS(-) protonation. Net acid transport by the Cl(-)/HS(-)/H2S cycle is more efficient than by the Cl(-)/HCO3(-)/CO2 cycle because of the rapid H2S-HS(-) interconversion in cells and medium. The rates of acid transport were analyzed by solving the mass flow equations for the cycle to produce estimates of the HS(-) and H2S transport rates. The data indicate that HS(-) is a very good substrate for AE1; the Cl(-)/HS(-) exchange rate is about one-third as rapid as Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchange. The H2S permeability coefficient must also be high (>10(-2) cm/s, half time <0.003 s) to account for the pH equilibration data. The results imply that H2S and HS(-) enter erythrocytes very rapidly in the microcirculation of H2S-producing tissues, thereby acting as a sink for H2S and lowering the local extracellular concentration, and the fact that HS(-) is a substrate for a Cl(-)/HCO3(-) exchanger indicates that some effects of exogenous H2S/HS(-) may not result from a regulatory role of H2S but, rather, from net acid flux by H2S and HS(-) transport in a Jacobs-Stewart cycle.	eng	C941	C950	American journal of physiology.

844	24100324	Structure of fully liganded Hb ζ2β2s trapped in a tense conformation.	A variant Hb ζ2β2(s) that is formed from sickle hemoglobin (Hb S; α2β2(s)) by exchanging adult α-globin with embryonic ζ-globin subunits shows promise as a therapeutic agent for sickle-cell disease (SCD). Hb ζ2β2(s) inhibits the polymerization of deoxygenated Hb S in vitro and reverses characteristic features of SCD in vivo in mouse models of the disorder. When compared with either Hb S or with normal human adult Hb A (α2β2), Hb ζ2β2(s) exhibits atypical properties that include a high oxygen affinity, reduced cooperativity, a weak Bohr effect and blunted 2,3-diphosphoglycerate allostery. Here, the 1.95 Å resolution crystal structure of human Hb ζ2β2(s) that was expressed in complex transgenic knockout mice and purified from their erythrocytes is presented. When fully liganded with carbon monoxide, Hb ζ2β2(s) displays a central water cavity, a ζ1-β(s)2 (or ζ2-β(s)1) interface, intersubunit salt-bridge/hydrogen-bond interactions, C-terminal βHis146 salt-bridge interactions, and a β-cleft, that are highly unusual for a relaxed hemoglobin structure and are more typical of a tense conformation. These quaternary tense-like features contrast with the tertiary relaxed-like conformations of the ζ1β(s)1 dimer and the CD and FG corners, as well as the overall structures of the heme cavities. This crystallographic study provides insights into the altered oxygen-transport properties of Hb ζ2β2(s) and, moreover, decouples tertiary- and quaternary-structural events that are critical to Hb ligand binding and allosteric function.	eng	2061	2071	Acta crystallographica.

845	24454878	Dysferlin and other non-red cell proteins accumulate in the red cell membrane of Diamond-Blackfan Anemia patients.	Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a congenital anemia usually caused by diverse mutations in ribosomal proteins. Although the genetics of DBA are well characterized, the mechanisms that lead to macrocytic anemia remain unclear. We systematically analyzed the proteomes of red blood cell membranes from multiple DBA patients to determine whether abnormalities in protein translation or erythropoiesis contribute to the observed macrocytosis or alterations in the mature red blood cell membrane. In depth proteome analysis of red cell membranes enabled highly reproducible identification and quantitative comparisons of 1100 or more proteins. These comparisons revealed clear differences between red cell membrane proteomes in DBA patients and healthy controls that were consistent across DBA patients with different ribosomal gene mutations. Proteins exhibiting changes in abundance included those known to be increased in DBA such as fetal hemoglobin and a number of proteins not normally found in mature red cell membranes, including proteins involved in the major histocompatibility complex class I pathway. Most striking was the presence of dysferlin in the red blood cell membranes of DBA patients but absent in healthy controls. Immunoblot validation using red cell membranes isolated from additional DBA patients and healthy controls confirmed a distinct membrane protein signature specific to patients with DBA.	eng	e85504		PloS one	9	1	2014			D000293;D000328;D029503/Q000097;D029503/Q000378;D002648;D002675;D000073939;D004910/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D008297;D008565/Q000378;D009124/Q000378;D040901;D015203;D055815	Adolescent;Adult;Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan/blood;Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan/metabolism;Child;Child, Preschool;Dysferlin;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Female;Humans;Male;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Muscle Proteins/metabolism;Proteomics;Reproducibility of Results;Young Adult	Pesciotta EN;Sriswasdi S;Tang HY;Speicher DW;Mason PJ;Bessler M	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell;erythro	True
846	24494200	Endothelial nitric oxide synthase in red blood cells: key to a new erythrocrine function?	"Red blood cells (RBC) have been considered almost exclusively as a transporter of metabolic gases and nutrients for the tissues. It is an accepted dogma that RBCs take up and inactivate endothelium-derived NO via rapid reaction with oxyhemoglobin to form methemoglobin and nitrate, thereby limiting NO available for vasodilatation. Yet it has also been shown that RBCs not only act as ""NO sinks"", but exert an erythrocrine function - i.e an endocrine function of RBC - by synthesizing, transporting and releasing NO metabolic products and ATP, thereby potentially controlling systemic NO bioavailability and vascular tone. Recent work from our and others laboratory demonstrated that human RBCs carry an active type 3, endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), constitutively producing NO under normoxic conditions, the activity of which is compromised in patients with coronary artery disease. In this review we aim to discuss the potential role of red cell eNOS in RBC signaling and function, and to critically revise evidence to this date showing a role of non-endothelial circulating eNOS in cardiovascular pathophysiology."	eng	251	258	Redox biology	2		2014			D000818;D001793;D002318/Q000097;D002318/Q000201;D002318/Q000503;D042783/Q000201;D004905;D004912/Q000201;D006439;D006706;D006801;D000860/Q000503;D051379;D018345;D009569/Q000096;D009569/Q000097;D052250/Q000097;D052250/Q000172;D052250/Q000502;D015398;D065227;D014664/Q000502	Animals;Blood Preservation;Cardiovascular Diseases/blood;Cardiovascular Diseases/enzymology;Cardiovascular Diseases/physiopathology;Endothelial Cells/enzymology;Erythrocyte Aging;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Hemodynamics;Homeostasis;Humans;Hypoxia/physiopathology;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Nitric Oxide/biosynthesis;Nitric Oxide/blood;Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/blood;Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/deficiency;Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/physiology;Signal Transduction;Transfusion Reaction;Vasodilation/physiology	Cortese-Krott MM;Kelm M	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.redox.2013.12.027		Erythrocyte;Red blood cell;erythro;red blood cell;RBC;red cell	True
847	24940698	Selection of the best blood compartment to measure cytidine deaminase activity to stratify for optimal gemcitabine or cytarabine treatment.	Cytidine deaminase (CDA) plays a crucial role in the degradation of cytidine analogs, such as gemcitabine and cytarabine. Several studies showed that a low CDA activity is associated with more toxicity but a higher efficacy, while a high activity will lead to a lower efficacy but less toxicity. A stratified dosing strategy based on the relative CDA activity would increase efficiency. In order to predict these events, a reliable measurement of CDA with a validated method is crucial. We aimed to determine which phenotype assay would be most suitable; a spectrophotometric assay using cytidine as a substrate, or an HPLC assay using gemcitabine as a substrate. In serum and whole blood of 26 volunteers, both assays showed an excellent correlation (R>0.999), but not in plasma nor in red blood cells. Moreover, there was no difference between males and females. In conclusion, the spectrophotometric assay seems the most simple and cost-effective test. It should be performed in serum, while it should be normalized on protein content as measured by the Bicinchoninic Acid.	eng	403	412	Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids	33	4-6	2014			D000328;D003362;D003561/Q000494;D003564/Q000097;D003564/Q000378;D003841/Q000031;D003841/Q000494;D057075/Q000191;D057075/Q000379;D005260;D006801;D008297;D008875;D015203;D055815;D000093542	Adult;Cost-Benefit Analysis;Cytarabine/pharmacology;Cytidine Deaminase/blood;Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism;Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives;Deoxycytidine/pharmacology;Enzyme Assays/economics;Enzyme Assays/methods;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Reproducibility of Results;Young Adult;Gemcitabine	Peters GJ;Honeywell RJ;Maulandi M;Giovannetti E;Losekoot N;Etienne-Grimaldi MC;Milano G;Serdjebi C;Ciccolini J;None None	Journal, Articles					10.1080/15257770.2014.894196		red blood cell	True
848	25379381	Irreversible hyperoxidation of peroxiredoxin 2 is caused by tert-butyl hydroperoxide in human red blood cells.	Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is the third most abundant protein in red blood cells (RBCs). In this study, we have succeeded in implementing the rapid and simultaneous detection of the hyperoxidized (Prx2-SO2/3) and reduced (Prx2-SH) forms of Prx2 in human RBCs using reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The detection of a peak corresponding to Prx2-SO2/3 was clearly observed following treatment of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP), but not H2O2, and was found to be dose-dependent. The identity of the peak was confirmed as Prx2 by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis. Our results suggest that t-BHP hyperoxidizes cysteine residues in Prx2 more readily than H2O2, and that accumulation of hyperoxidized Prx2 might reflect disruption of redox homeostasis in RBCs.	eng	848	852	FEBS open bio	4		2014					Ishida YI;Takikawa M;Suzuki T;Nagahama M;Ogasawara Y	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.fob.2014.10.003		RBC;red blood cell	True
849	24636780	Metabolomics of ADSOL (AS-1) red blood cell storage.	Population-based investigations suggest that red blood cells (RBCs) are therapeutically effective when collected, processed, and stored for up to 42 days under validated conditions before transfusion. However, some retrospective clinical studies have shown worse patient outcomes when transfused RBCs have been stored for the longest times. Furthermore, studies of RBC persistence in the circulation after transfusion have suggested that considerable donor-to-donor variability exists and may affect transfusion efficacy. To understand the limitations of current blood storage technologies and to develop approaches to improve RBC storage and transfusion efficacy, we investigated the global metabolic alterations that occur when RBCs are stored in AS-1 (AS1-RBC). Leukoreduced AS1-RBC units prepared from 9 volunteer research donors (12 total donated units) were serially sampled for metabolomics analysis over 42 days of refrigerated storage. Samples were tested by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and specific biochemical compounds were identified by comparison to a library of purified standards. Over 3 experiments, 185 to 264 defined metabolites were quantified in stored RBC samples. Kinetic changes in these biochemicals confirmed known alterations in glycolysis and other pathways previously identified in RBCs stored in saline, adenine, glucose and mannitol solution (SAGM-RBC). Furthermore, we identified additional alterations not previously seen in SAGM-RBCs (eg, stable pentose phosphate pathway flux, progressive decreases in oxidized glutathione), and we delineated changes occurring in other metabolic pathways not previously studied (eg, S-adenosyl methionine cycle). These data are presented in the context of a detailed comparison with previous studies of SAGM-RBCs from human donors and murine AS1-RBCs. Global metabolic profiling of AS1-RBCs revealed a number of biochemical alterations in stored blood that may affect RBC viability during storage as well as therapeutic effectiveness of stored RBCs in transfusion recipients. These results provide future opportunities to more clearly pinpoint the metabolic defects during RBC storage, to identify biomarkers for donor screening and prerelease RBC testing, and to develop improved RBC storage solutions and methodologies.	eng	41	55	Transfusion medicine reviews	28	2	2014	Apr		D000225/Q000737;D000818;D001793/Q000379;D002462/Q000378;D002853;D017707/Q000379;D004912/Q000166;D008401;D005947/Q000737;D006019;D006801;D007700;D008055/Q000737;D008353/Q000737;D055442;D051379;D008810;D018384;D015398;D012965/Q000737;D053719	Adenine/chemistry;Animals;Blood Preservation/methods;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Chromatography, Liquid;Erythrocyte Transfusion/methods;Erythrocytes/cytology;Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry;Glucose/chemistry;Glycolysis;Humans;Kinetics;Lipids/chemistry;Mannitol/chemistry;Metabolome;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Oxidative Stress;Signal Transduction;Sodium Chloride/chemistry;Tandem Mass Spectrometry	Roback JD;Josephson CD;Waller EK;Newman JL;Karatela S;Uppal K;Jones DP;Zimring JC;Dumont LJ	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.tmrv.2014.01.003		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
850	24555563	Annotating N termini for the human proteome project: N termini and Nα-acetylation status differentiate stable cleaved protein species from degradation remnants in the human erythrocyte proteome.	"A goal of the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project is to identify all human protein species. With 3844 proteins annotated as ""missing"", this is challenging. Moreover, proteolytic processing generates new protein species with characteristic neo-N termini that are frequently accompanied by altered half-lives, function, interactions, and location. Enucleated and largely void of internal membranes and organelles, erythrocytes are simple yet proteomically challenging cells due to the high hemoglobin content and wide dynamic range of protein concentrations that impedes protein identification. Using the N-terminomics procedure TAILS, we identified 1369 human erythrocyte natural and neo-N-termini and 1234 proteins. Multiple semitryptic N-terminal peptides exhibited improved mass spectrometric identification properties versus the intact tryptic peptide enabling identification of 281 novel erythrocyte proteins and six missing proteins identified for the first time in the human proteome. With an improved bioinformatics workflow, we developed a new classification system and the Terminus Cluster Score. Thereby we described a new stabilizing N-end rule for processed protein termini, which discriminates novel protein species from degradation remnants, and identified protein domain hot spots susceptible to cleavage. Strikingly, 68% of the N-termini were within genome-encoded protein sequences, revealing alternative translation initiation sites, pervasive endoproteolytic processing, and stabilization of protein fragments in vivo. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to ProteomeXchange with the data set identifier <PXD000434>."	eng	2028	2044	Journal of proteome research	13	4	2014	Apr	04	D000107;D001798/Q000032;D001798/Q000737;D001798/Q000145;D030562;D004912/Q000737;D006801;D020543/Q000032;D020543/Q000737;D040901/Q000379	Acetylation;Blood Proteins/analysis;Blood Proteins/chemistry;Blood Proteins/classification;Databases, Protein;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Humans;Proteome/analysis;Proteome/chemistry;Proteomics/methods	Lange PF;Huesgen PF;Nguyen K;Overall CM	Journal, Articles					10.1021/pr401191w		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
851	24788727	PIPKIIα is widely expressed in hematopoietic-derived cells and may play a role in the expression of alpha- and gamma-globins in K562 cells.	Characterized for the first time in erythrocytes, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIP kinases) belong to a family of enzymes that generate various lipid messengers and participate in several cellular processes, including gene expression regulation. Recently, the PIPKIIα gene was found to be differentially expressed in reticulocytes from two siblings with hemoglobin H disease, suggesting a possible relationship between PIPKIIα and the production of globins. Here, we investigated PIPKIIα gene and protein expression and protein localization in hematopoietic-derived cells during their differentiation, and the effects of PIPKIIα silencing on K562 cells. PIPKIIα silencing resulted in an increase in α and γ globins and a decrease in the proliferation of K562 cells without affecting cell cycle progression and apoptosis. In conclusion, using a cell line model, we showed that PIPKIIα is widely expressed in hematopoietic-derived cells, is localized in their cytoplasm and nucleus, and is upregulated during erythroid differentiation. We also showed that PIPKIIα silencing can induce α and γ globin expression and decrease cell proliferation in K562 cells.	eng	145	153	Molecular and cellular biochemistry	393	1-2	2014	Aug		D017209/Q000235;D049109/Q000235;D005786;D020868;D006412/Q000378;D006801;D020014;D017853/Q000096;D017853/Q000235;D055542/Q000096;D005719/Q000096	Apoptosis/genetics;Cell Proliferation/genetics;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Silencing;Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism;Humans;K562 Cells;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/biosynthesis;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics;alpha-Globins/biosynthesis;gamma-Globulins/biosynthesis	Peretti de Albuquerque Wobeto V;Machado-Neto JA;Zaccariotto TR;Ribeiro DM;da Silva Santos Duarte A;Saad ST;Costa FF;de Fatima Sonati M	Journal, Articles					10.1007/s11010-014-2054-y		erythrocyte;erythro	True
852	24953180	Glucose and glutamine metabolism regulate human hematopoietic stem cell lineage specification.	The metabolic state of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is an important regulator of self-renewal, but it is unclear whether or how metabolic parameters contribute to HSC lineage specification and commitment. Here, we show that the commitment of human and murine HSCs to the erythroid lineage is dependent upon glutamine metabolism. HSCs require the ASCT2 glutamine transporter and active glutamine metabolism for erythroid specification. Blocking this pathway diverts EPO-stimulated HSCs to differentiate into myelomonocytic fates, altering in vivo HSC responses and erythroid commitment under stress conditions such as hemolytic anemia. Mechanistically, erythroid specification of HSCs requires glutamine-dependent de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. Exogenous nucleosides rescue erythroid commitment of human HSCs under conditions of limited glutamine catabolism, and glucose-stimulated nucleotide biosynthesis further enhances erythroid specification. Thus, the availability of glutamine and glucose to provide fuel for nucleotide biosynthesis regulates HSC lineage commitment under conditions of metabolic stress.	eng	169	184	Cell stem cell	15	2	2014	Aug	07	D051997/Q000378;D026962/Q000378;D000818;D018952/Q000378;D001692;D002454;D019070;D002853;D004912/Q000166;D005786;D005947/Q000378;D005973/Q000378;D006019;D049452/Q000378;D006412/Q000166;D006801;D013058;D051379;D008810;D015778;D034741/Q000378	ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism;Amino Acid Transport System ASC/metabolism;Animals;Antigens, CD34/metabolism;Biological Transport;Cell Differentiation;Cell Lineage;Chromatography, Liquid;Erythrocytes/cytology;Gene Expression Regulation;Glucose/metabolism;Glutamine/metabolism;Glycolysis;Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism;Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology;Humans;Mass Spectrometry;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Minor Histocompatibility Antigens;RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism	Oburoglu L;Tardito S;Fritz V;de Barros SC;Merida P;Craveiro M;Mamede J;Cretenet G;Mongellaz C;An X;Klysz D;Touhami J;Boyer-Clavel M;Battini JL;Dardalhon V;Zimmermann VS;Mohandas N;Gottlieb E;Sitbon M;Kinet S;Taylor N	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.stem.2014.06.002		Erythrocyte;erythro	True
853	25092340	Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells.	The catalytic cysteine of the typical 2-Cys Prx subfamily of peroxiredoxins is occasionally hyperoxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid during the peroxidase catalytic cycle. Sulfinic Prx (Prx-SO2H) is reduced back to the active form of the enzyme by sulfiredoxin. The abundance of Prx-SO2H was recently shown to oscillate with a period of ∼24 h in human red blood cells (RBCs). We have now investigated the molecular mechanism and physiological relevance of such oscillation in mouse RBCs. Poisoning of RBCs with CO abolished Prx-SO2H formation, implicating H2O2 produced from hemoglobin autoxidation in Prx hyperoxidation. RBCs express the closely related PrxI and PrxII isoforms, and analysis of RBCs deficient in either isoform identified PrxII as the hyperoxidized Prx in these cells. Unexpectedly, RBCs from sulfiredoxin-deficient mice also exhibited circadian oscillation of Prx-SO2H. Analysis of the effects of protease inhibitors together with the observation that the purified 20S proteasome degraded PrxII-SO2H selectively over nonhyperoxidized PrxII suggested that the 20S proteasome is responsible for the decay phase of PrxII-SO2H oscillation. About 1% of total PrxII undergoes daily oscillation, resulting in a gradual loss of PrxII during the life span of RBCs. PrxII-SO2H was detected in cytosolic and ghost membrane fractions of RBCs, and the amount of membrane-bound PrxII-SO2H oscillated in a phase opposite to that of total PrxII-SO2H. Our results suggest that membrane association of PrxII-SO2H is a tightly controlled process and might play a role in the tuning of RBC function to environmental changes.	eng	12043	12048	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	111	33	2014	Aug	19	D000818;D002478;D002940;D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000378;D006454/Q000378;D051379;D010084;D054464/Q000378;D046988/Q000097	Animals;Cells, Cultured;Circadian Rhythm;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Mice;Oxidation-Reduction;Peroxiredoxins/metabolism;Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/blood	Cho CS;Yoon HJ;Kim JY;Woo HA;Rhee SG	Journal, Articles					10.1073/pnas.1401100111		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True

857	25075126	Acid sphingomyelinase is activated in sickle cell erythrocytes and contributes to inflammatory microparticle generation in SCD.	Sphingolipids are a class of lipids containing a backbone of sphingoid bases that can be produced de novo through the reaction of palmitate and serine and further metabolized through the activity of various enzymes to produce intermediates with diverse roles in cellular processes and signal transduction. One of these intermediates, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), is stored at high concentrations (1 μM) in red blood cells (RBCs) and directs a wide array of cellular processes mediated by 5 known G-protein coupled receptors (S1P1-S1P5). In this study, we show that RBC membrane alterations in sickle cell disease enhance the activation acid sphingomyelinase by 13%, resulting in increased production and storage of sphingosine (2.6-fold) and S1P (3.5-fold). We also show that acid sphingomyelinase enhances RBC-derived microparticle (MP) generation. These MPs are internalized by myeloid cells and promote proinflammatory cytokine secretion and endothelial cell adhesion, suggesting that potential crosstalk between circulating inflammatory cells and MPs may contribute to the inflammation-rooted pathogenesis of the disease. Treatment with amitriptyline reduces MP generation in vitro and in vivo and might be used to mitigate inflammatory processes in sickle cell disease.	eng	1941	1950	Blood	124	12	2014	Sep	18	D000755/Q000097;D000755/Q000201;D000755/Q000209;D000818;D002448;D015815/Q000097;D055252/Q000201;D004195;D042783/Q000473;D004913/Q000201;D006451/Q000235;D006801;D007249/Q000097;D007249/Q000201;D008246/Q000097;D020935;D051379;D008810;D008817;D008822;D013107/Q000097;D013108/Q000097;D013110/Q000031;D013110/Q000097	Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood;Anemia, Sickle Cell/enzymology;Anemia, Sickle Cell/etiology;Animals;Cell Adhesion;Cell Adhesion Molecules/blood;Cell-Derived Microparticles/enzymology;Disease Models, Animal;Endothelial Cells/pathology;Erythrocytes, Abnormal/enzymology;Hemoglobin, Sickle/genetics;Humans;Inflammation/blood;Inflammation/enzymology;Lysophospholipids/blood;MAP Kinase Signaling System;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Mutant Strains;Mice, Transgenic;Sphingolipids/blood;Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/blood;Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives;Sphingosine/blood	Awojoodu AO;Keegan PM;Lane AR;Zhang Y;Lynch KR;Platt MO;Botchwey EA	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood-2014-01-543652		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
858	26078478	Inconsistencies in the red blood cell membrane proteome analysis: generation of a database for research and diagnostic applications.	Based on recent results, the determination of the easily accessible red blood cell (RBC) membrane proteins may provide new diagnostic possibilities for assessing mutations, polymorphisms or regulatory alterations in diseases. However, the analysis of the current mass spectrometry-based proteomics datasets and other major databases indicates inconsistencies-the results show large scattering and only a limited overlap for the identified RBC membrane proteins. Here, we applied membrane-specific proteomics studies in human RBC, compared these results with the data in the literature, and generated a comprehensive and expandable database using all available data sources. The integrated web database now refers to proteomic, genetic and medical databases as well, and contains an unexpected large number of validated membrane proteins previously thought to be specific for other tissues and/or related to major human diseases. Since the determination of protein expression in RBC provides a method to indicate pathological alterations, our database should facilitate the development of RBC membrane biomarker platforms and provide a unique resource to aid related further research and diagnostics.	eng	bav056		Database : the journal of biological databases and curation	2015		2015			D030562;D004910/Q000235;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D008565/Q000235;D008565/Q000378;D020543/Q000235;D020543/Q000378	Databases, Protein;Erythrocyte Membrane/genetics;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Membrane Proteins/genetics;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Proteome/genetics;Proteome/metabolism	Hegedűs T;Chaubey PM;Várady G;Szabó E;Sarankó H;Hofstetter L;Roschitzki B;Stieger B;Sarkadi B	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
859	26418250	Impact of cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 inhibition on eryptosis.	The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) participates in the regulation of apoptosis of nucleated cells by altering transcriptional regulation of genes governing cell proliferation and cell death. Similar to apoptosis of nucleated cells, erythrocytes may enter eryptosis, which is characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure at the cell surface. As mature erythrocytes lack nuclei, acute stimulation of eryptosis cannot result from altered gene expression. Eryptosis is triggered by isotonic cell shrinkage following Cl- removal (replacement with the impermeant organic anion gluconate) or by oxidative stress (exposure to 0.3 mM tertbutyl-hydroperoxide [tBOOH]). The present study explored whether CDK4 is expressed in erythrocytes and whether the CDK4 inhibitors II (NSC625987) and III (ryuvidine) influence eryptosis.	eng	1178	1186	Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology	37	3	2015			D017209;D002470/Q000187;D051358/Q000037;D051358/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D010718/Q000378;D047428/Q000494;D020122/Q000494	Apoptosis;Cell Survival/drug effects;Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/antagonists & inhibitors;Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Phosphatidylserines/metabolism;Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology;tert-Butylhydroperoxide/pharmacology	Lang E;Zelenak C;Eberhard M;Bissinger R;Rotte A;Ghashghaeinia M;Lupescu A;Lang F;Qadri SM	Journal, Articles					10.1159/000430241		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
860	26474164	In-Depth, Label-Free Analysis of the Erythrocyte Cytoplasmic Proteome in Diamond Blackfan Anemia Identifies a Unique Inflammatory Signature.	Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a rare, congenital erythrocyte aplasia that is usually caused by haploinsufficiency of ribosomal proteins due to diverse mutations in one of several ribosomal genes. A striking feature of this disease is that a range of different mutations in ribosomal proteins results in similar disease phenotypes primarily characterized by erythrocyte abnormalities and macrocytic anemia, while most other cell types in the body are minimally affected. Previously, we analyzed the erythrocyte membrane proteomes of several DBA patients and identified several proteins that are not typically associated with this cell type and that suggested inflammatory mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of DBA. In this study, we evaluated the erythrocyte cytosolic proteome of DBA patients through in-depth analysis of hemoglobin-depleted erythrocyte cytosols. Simple, reproducible, hemoglobin depletion using nickel columns enabled in-depth analysis of over 1000 cytosolic erythrocyte proteins with only moderate total analysis time per proteome. Label-free quantitation and statistical analysis identified 29 proteins with significantly altered abundance levels in DBA patients compared to matched healthy control donors. Proteins that were significantly increased in DBA erythrocyte cytoplasms included three proteasome subunit beta proteins that make up the immunoproteasome and proteins induced by interferon-γ such as n-myc interactor and interferon-induced 35 kDa protein [NMI and IFI35 respectively]. Pathway analysis confirmed the presence of an inflammatory signature in erythrocytes of DBA patients and predicted key upstream regulators including mitogen activated kinase 1, interferon-γ, tumor suppressor p53, and tumor necrosis factor. These results show that erythrocytes in DBA patients are intrinsically different from those in healthy controls which may be due to an inflammatory response resulting from the inherent molecular defect of ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency or changes in the bone marrow microenvironment that leads to red cell aplasia in DBA patients.	eng	e0140036		PloS one	10	10	2015			D000293;D000328;D029503/Q000097;D003600/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D007249/Q000097;D008297;D020543/Q000378	Adolescent;Adult;Anemia, Diamond-Blackfan/blood;Cytosol/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Inflammation/blood;Male;Proteome/metabolism	Pesciotta EN;Lam HS;Kossenkov A;Ge J;Showe LC;Mason PJ;Bessler M;Speicher DW	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
861	26579528	P2X and P2Y receptor signaling in red blood cells.	Purinergic signaling involves the activation of cell surface P1 and P2 receptors by extracellular nucleosides and nucleotides such as adenosine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), respectively. P2 receptors comprise P2X and P2Y receptors, and have well-established roles in leukocyte and platelet biology. Emerging evidence indicates important roles for these receptors in red blood cells. P2 receptor activation stimulates a number of signaling pathways in progenitor red blood cells resulting in microparticle release, reactive oxygen species formation, and apoptosis. Likewise, activation of P2 receptors in mature red blood cells stimulates signaling pathways mediating volume regulation, eicosanoid release, phosphatidylserine exposure, hemolysis, impaired ATP release, and susceptibility or resistance to infection. This review summarizes the distribution of P2 receptors in red blood cells, and outlines the functions of P2 receptor signaling in these cells and its implications in red blood cell biology.	eng	60		Frontiers in molecular biosciences	2		2015					Sluyter R	Journal, Articles							red blood cell	True
862		Quantitative analysis of the erythrocyte membrane proteins in polycythemia vera patients treated with hydroxycarbamide,	More than 90% of polycythemia vera (PV) patients have a mutation in the protein JAK2, which is closely associated with the erythrocyte membrane. With the comparison of 1-D gels of erythrocyte membranes obtained from PV patients treated with hydroxycarbamide and those of untreated controls we observed significant differences in the region of 40–55kDa. On the basis of the LC–MS/MS analysis of this region we report up-regulation of four protein disulfide isomerases, which was subsequently confirmed by targeted mass spectrometric analysis. In further studies it will be prudent to compare this in patients both treated and not treated with hydroxycarbamide.		43	53	EuPA Open Proteomics,	7		2015					Kottahachchi D, Gooneratne L, Jayasekera A, Muth-Pawlak D, Moulder R, Imanishi SY, Ariyaratne A, Rokka A, Corthals GL,						10.1016/j.euprot.2015.04.001	Erythrocyte membrane associated proteins; Polycythemia vera; JAK2 V617F; Quantitation; MS; Protein disulfide isomerase	Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
863	25757360	Identification of signalling cascades involved in red blood cell shrinkage and vesiculation.	Even though red blood cell (RBC) vesiculation is a well-documented phenomenon, notably in the context of RBC aging and blood transfusion, the exact signalling pathways and kinases involved in this process remain largely unknown. We have established a screening method for RBC vesicle shedding using the Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin which is a rapid and efficient method to promote vesiculation. In order to identify novel pathways stimulating vesiculation in RBC, we screened two libraries: the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC) and the Selleckchem Kinase Inhibitor Library for their effects on RBC from healthy donors. We investigated compounds triggering vesiculation and compounds inhibiting vesiculation induced by ionomycin. We identified 12 LOPAC compounds, nine kinase inhibitors and one kinase activator which induced RBC shrinkage and vesiculation. Thus, we discovered several novel pathways involved in vesiculation including G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt (protein kinase B) pathway, the Jak-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway and the Raf-MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase)-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated a link between casein kinase 2 (CK2) and RBC shrinkage via regulation of the Gardos channel activity. In addition, our data showed that inhibition of several kinases with unknown functions in mature RBC, including Alk (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), induced RBC shrinkage and vesiculation.	eng			Bioscience reports	35	2	2015	Apr	16	D061207/Q000494;D047390/Q000378;D055252/Q000378;D016922/Q000187;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D015759/Q000494;D048490/Q000378	Calcium Ionophores/pharmacology;Casein Kinase II/metabolism;Cell-Derived Microparticles/metabolism;Cellular Senescence/drug effects;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Ionomycin/pharmacology;raf Kinases/metabolism	Kostova EB;Beuger BM;Klei TR;Halonen P;Lieftink C;Beijersbergen R;van den Berg TK;van Bruggen R	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
864	26285072	Oxidative stress in β-thalassaemia and sickle cell disease.	Sickle cell disease and β-thalassaemia are inherited haemoglobinopathies resulting in structural and quantitative changes in the β-globin chain. These changes lead to instability of the generated haemoglobin or to globin chain imbalance, which in turn impact the oxidative environment both intracellularly and extracellularly. The ensuing oxidative stress and the inability of the body to adequately overcome it are, to a large extent, responsible for the pathophysiology of these diseases. This article provides an overview of the main players and control mechanisms involved in the establishment of oxidative stress in these haemoglobinopathies.	eng	226	239	Redox biology	6		2015	Dec		D000755/Q000097;D000755/Q000473;D001457/Q000737;D001457/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000473;D006418/Q000737;D006418/Q000378;D006420/Q000737;D006420/Q000378;D006801;D007501/Q000378;D019190/Q000097;D019190/Q000473;D018384;D010718/Q000737;D010718/Q000378;D055550;D017382/Q000378;D015427/Q000097;D015427/Q000473;D019851/Q000097;D019851/Q000473;D055544/Q000378;D017086/Q000097;D017086/Q000473	Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood;Anemia, Sickle Cell/pathology;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/chemistry;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/pathology;Heme/chemistry;Heme/metabolism;Hemeproteins/chemistry;Hemeproteins/metabolism;Humans;Iron/metabolism;Iron Overload/blood;Iron Overload/pathology;Oxidative Stress;Phosphatidylserines/chemistry;Phosphatidylserines/metabolism;Protein Stability;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism;Reperfusion Injury/blood;Reperfusion Injury/pathology;Thrombophilia/blood;Thrombophilia/pathology;beta-Globins/metabolism;beta-Thalassemia/blood;beta-Thalassemia/pathology	Voskou S;Aslan M;Fanis P;Phylactides M;Kleanthous M	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.redox.2015.07.018		Erythrocyte	True
865	26460266	The free heme concentration in healthy human erythrocytes.	Heme, the prosthetic group of hemoglobin, may be released from its host due to an intrinsic instability of hemoglobin and accumulate in the erythrocytes. Free heme is in the form of hematin (Fe(3+) protoporphyrin IX OH) and follows several pathways of biochemical toxicity to tissues, cells, and organelles since it catalyzes the production of reactive oxygen species. To determine concentration of soluble free heme in human erythrocytes, we develop a new method. We lyse the red blood cells and isolate free heme from hemoglobin by dialysis. We use the heme to reconstitute horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from an excess of the apoenzyme and determine the HRP reaction rate from the evolution of the emitted luminescence. We find that in a population of five healthy adults the average free heme concentration in the erythrocytes is 21±2μM, ca. 100× higher than previously determined. Tests suggest that the lower previous value was due to the use of elevated concentrations of NaCl, which drive hematin precipitation and re-association with apoglobin. We show that the found hematin concentration is significantly higher than estimates based on equilibrium release and the known hematin dimerization. The factors that lead to enhanced heme release remain an open question.	eng	402	409	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	55	4	2015	Dec		D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D064368;D006418/Q000378;D006461;D006801;D011485;D006435	Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Healthy Volunteers;Heme/metabolism;Hemolysis;Humans;Protein Binding;Renal Dialysis	Aich A;Freundlich M;Vekilov PG	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bcmd.2015.09.003		Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
866	26515061	ATP-binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 5 (ABCC5) Functions as an Efflux Transporter of Glutamate Conjugates and Analogs.	The ubiquitous efflux transporter ABCC5 (ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 5) is present at high levels in the blood-brain barrier, neurons, and glia, but its in vivo substrates and function are not known. Using untargeted metabolomic screens, we show that Abcc5(-/-) mice accumulate endogenous glutamate conjugates in several tissues, but brain in particular. The abundant neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate was 2.4-fold higher in Abcc5(-/-) brain. The metabolites that accumulated in Abcc5(-/-) tissues were depleted in cultured cells that overexpressed human ABCC5. In a vesicular membrane transport assay, ABCC5 also transported exogenous glutamate analogs, like the classic excitotoxic neurotoxins kainic acid, domoic acid, and NMDA; the therapeutic glutamate analog ZJ43; and, as previously shown, the anti-cancer drug methotrexate. Glutamate conjugates and analogs are of physiological relevance because they can affect the function of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. After CO2 asphyxiation, several immediate early genes were expressed at lower levels in Abcc5(-/-) brains than in wild type brains, suggesting altered glutamate signaling. Our results show that ABCC5 is a general glutamate conjugate and analog transporter that affects the disposition of endogenous metabolites, toxins, and drugs.	eng	30429	30440	The Journal of biological chemistry	290	51	2015	Dec	18	D000818;D001921/Q000378;D004151/Q000493;D004151/Q000494;D006801;D007608/Q000031;D007608/Q000493;D007608/Q000494;D051379;D018345;D027425/Q000235;D027425/Q000378;D009419/Q000235;D009419/Q000378;D014508/Q000031;D014508/Q000493;D014508/Q000494	Animals;Brain/metabolism;Dipeptides/pharmacokinetics;Dipeptides/pharmacology;Humans;Kainic Acid/analogs & derivatives;Kainic Acid/pharmacokinetics;Kainic Acid/pharmacology;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism;Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics;Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism;Urea/analogs & derivatives;Urea/pharmacokinetics;Urea/pharmacology	Jansen RS;Mahakena S;de Haas M;Borst P;van de Wetering K	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M115.692103		red cell	True

868	25416785	Parkinsonism-associated protein DJ-1/Park7 is a major protein deglycase that repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated cysteine, arginine, and lysine residues.	Glycation is an inevitable nonenzymatic covalent reaction between proteins and endogenous reducing sugars or dicarbonyls (methylglyoxal, glyoxal) that results in protein inactivation. DJ-1 was reported to be a multifunctional oxidative stress response protein with poorly defined function. Here, we show that human DJ-1 is a protein deglycase that repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated amino acids and proteins by acting on early glycation intermediates and releases repaired proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. DJ-1 deglycates cysteines, arginines, and lysines (the three major glycated amino acids) of serum albumin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase, and aspartate aminotransferase and thus reactivates these proteins. DJ-1 prevented protein glycation in an Escherichia coli mutant deficient in the DJ-1 homolog YajL and restored cell viability in glucose-containing media. These results suggest that DJ-1-associated Parkinsonism results from excessive protein glycation and establishes DJ-1 as a major anti-glycation and anti-aging protein.	eng	1885	1897	The Journal of biological chemistry	290	3	2015	Jan	16	D000111/Q000737;D000418/Q000737;D017209;D001120/Q000737;D001219/Q000378;D002384;D002470;D003545/Q000737;D004926/Q000378;D005634/Q000378;D005947/Q000737;D006016/Q000737;D006037/Q000737;D006801;D047908/Q000378;D007773/Q000737;D008239/Q000737;D013058;D015513/Q000378;D018384;D020734/Q000378;D000071617;D011765/Q000737	Acetylcysteine/chemistry;Albumins/chemistry;Apoptosis;Arginine/chemistry;Aspartate Aminotransferases/metabolism;Catalysis;Cell Survival;Cysteine/chemistry;Escherichia coli/metabolism;Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase/metabolism;Glucose/chemistry;Glycolates/chemistry;Glyoxal/chemistry;Humans;Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism;Lactates/chemistry;Lysine/chemistry;Mass Spectrometry;Oncogene Proteins/metabolism;Oxidative Stress;Parkinsonian Disorders/metabolism;Protein Deglycase DJ-1;Pyruvaldehyde/chemistry	Richarme G;Mihoub M;Dairou J;Bui LC;Leger T;Lamouri A	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M114.597815		red cell	True
869	26014962	Sources, metabolism, and regulation of circulating sphingosine-1-phosphate.	Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid that acts either as an intracellular messenger or as a ligand for its membrane receptors. S1P is a normal constituent of blood, where it is found both in plasma and blood cells. Compared with other cell types, sphingolipid metabolism in erythrocytes and platelets has unique features that allow the erythrocytes and platelets to accumulate S1P. In plasma, S1P is bound mainly to HDLs and albumin. Of note, metabolism and biological activity of S1P is to a large extent affected by the type of its carrier. Plasma S1P is characterized by a short half-life, indicating rapid clearance by degradative enzymes and the presence of high-capacity sources involved in maintaining its high concentration. These sources include blood cells, vascular endothelium, and hepatocytes. However, the extent to which each of these contributes to the plasma pool of S1P is a matter of debate. Circulating S1P plays a significant physiological role. It was found to be the key regulator of lymphocyte trafficking, endothelial barrier function, and vascular tone. The purpose of this review is to summarize the present state of knowledge on the metabolism, transport, and origin of plasma S1P, and to discuss the mechanisms regulating its homeostasis in blood.	eng	1271	1281	Journal of lipid research	56	7	2015	Jul		D000818;D001773/Q000378;D006801;D008246/Q000097;D008246/Q000378;D013110/Q000031;D013110/Q000097;D013110/Q000378	Animals;Blood Cells/metabolism;Humans;Lysophospholipids/blood;Lysophospholipids/metabolism;Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives;Sphingosine/blood;Sphingosine/metabolism	Książek M;Chacińska M;Chabowski A;Baranowski M	Journal, Articles					10.1194/jlr.R059543		erythrocyte	True
870	26195724	Basigin is a druggable target for host-oriented antimalarial interventions.	Plasmodium falciparum is the parasite responsible for the most lethal form of malaria, an infectious disease that causes a large proportion of childhood deaths and poses a significant barrier to socioeconomic development in many countries. Although antimalarial drugs exist, the repeated emergence and spread of drug-resistant parasites limit their useful lifespan. An alternative strategy that could limit the evolution of drug-resistant parasites is to target host factors that are essential and universally required for parasite growth. Host-targeted therapeutics have been successfully applied in other infectious diseases but have never been attempted for malaria. Here, we report the development of a recombinant chimeric antibody (Ab-1) against basigin, an erythrocyte receptor necessary for parasite invasion as a putative antimalarial therapeutic. Ab-1 inhibited the PfRH5-basigin interaction and potently blocked erythrocyte invasion by all parasite strains tested. Importantly, Ab-1 rapidly cleared an established P. falciparum blood-stage infection with no overt toxicity in an in vivo infection model. Collectively, our data demonstrate that antibodies or other therapeutics targeting host basigin could be an effective treatment for patients infected with multi-drug resistant P. falciparum.	eng	1145	1151	The Journal of experimental medicine	212	8	2015	Jul	27	D000818;D000906/Q000235;D000906/Q000494;D001483;D051926/Q000378;D002352/Q000378;D003001;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000469;D034982/Q000378;D008288/Q000517;D051379;D008969;D010963/Q000187;D010963/Q000378;D011993/Q000494;D017422;D020349	Animals;Antibodies/genetics;Antibodies/pharmacology;Base Sequence;Basigin/metabolism;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cloning, Molecular;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Integration Host Factors/metabolism;Malaria/prevention & control;Mice;Molecular Sequence Data;Plasmodium falciparum/drug effects;Plasmodium falciparum/metabolism;Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Surface Plasmon Resonance	Zenonos ZA;Dummler SK;Müller-Sienerth N;Chen J;Preiser PR;Rayner JC;Wright GJ	Journal, Articles					10.1084/jem.20150032		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

872	25500335	A genome-wide association study of saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated red blood cell fatty acids in the Framingham Heart Offspring Study.	Most genome-wide association studies have explored relationships between genetic variants and plasma phospholipid fatty acid proportions, but few have examined apparent genetic influences on the membrane fatty acid profile of red blood cells (RBC). Using RBC fatty acid data from the Framingham Offspring Study, we analyzed over 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with 14 RBC fatty acids identifying 191 different SNPs associated with at least 1 fatty acid. Significant associations (p<1×10(-8)) were located within five distinct 1MB regions. Of particular interest were novel associations between (1) arachidonic acid and PCOLCE2 (regulates apoA-I maturation and modulates apoA-I levels), and (2) oleic and linoleic acid and LPCAT3 (mediates the transfer of fatty acids between glycerolipids). We also replicated previously identified strong associations between SNPs in the FADS (chromosome 11) and ELOVL (chromosome 6) regions. Multiple SNPs explained 8-14% of the variation in 3 high abundance (>11%) fatty acids, but only 1-3% in 4 low abundance (<3%) fatty acids, with the notable exception of dihomo-gamma linolenic acid with 53% of variance explained by SNPs. Further studies are needed to determine the extent to which variations in these genes influence tissue fatty acid content and pathways modulated by fatty acids.	eng	65	72	Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids	94		2015	Mar		D008243/Q000235;D000123/Q000235;D000368;D002877/Q000235;D004912/Q000378;D016326/Q000235;D000081031;D005227/Q000097;D055106/Q000379;D005838;D006023/Q000235;D006801;D015810;D008137;D008297;D008404;D008875;D020641	1-Acylglycerophosphocholine O-Acyltransferase/genetics;Acetyltransferases/genetics;Aged;Chromosomes, Human/genetics;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Extracellular Matrix Proteins/genetics;Fatty Acid Elongases;Fatty Acids/blood;Genome-Wide Association Study/methods;Genotype;Glycoproteins/genetics;Humans;Linkage Disequilibrium;Longitudinal Studies;Male;Massachusetts;Middle Aged;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide	Tintle NL;Pottala JV;Lacey S;Ramachandran V;Westra J;Rogers A;Clark J;Olthoff B;Larson M;Harris W;Shearer GC	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.plefa.2014.11.007		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
873	25636585	Mechanisms and pathophysiological significance of eryptosis, the suicidal erythrocyte death.	Eryptosis, the suicidal erythrocyte death characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling, is stimulated by Ca(2+) entry through Ca(2+)-permeable, PGE2-activated cation channels, by ceramide, caspases, calpain, complement, hyperosmotic shock, energy depletion, oxidative stress, and deranged activity of several kinases (e.g. AMPK, GK, PAK2, CK1α, JAK3, PKC, p38-MAPK). Eryptosis is triggered by intoxication, malignancy, hepatic failure, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, hemolytic uremic syndrome, dehydration, phosphate depletion, fever, sepsis, mycoplasma infection, malaria, iron deficiency, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis may precede and protect against hemolysis but by the same token result in anemia and deranged microcirculation.	eng	35	42	Seminars in cell & developmental biology	39		2015	Mar		D000818;D016923;D002462/Q000473;D016922;D004912/Q000473;D006801;D018384	Animals;Cell Death;Cell Membrane/pathology;Cellular Senescence;Erythrocytes/pathology;Humans;Oxidative Stress	Lang E;Lang F	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.semcdb.2015.01.009		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
874	25688092	Sulfide oxidation by a noncanonical pathway in red blood cells generates thiosulfate and polysulfides.	A cardioprotectant at low concentrations, H2S is a toxin at high concentrations and inhibits cytochrome c oxidase. A conundrum in H2S homeostasis is its fate in red blood cells (RBCs), which produce H2S but lack the canonical mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway for its clearance. The sheer abundance of RBCs in circulation enhances the metabolic significance of their clearance strategy for H2S, necessary to avoid systemic toxicity. In this study, we demonstrate that H2S generation by RBCs is catalyzed by mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. Furthermore, we have discovered the locus of sulfide oxidation in RBCs and describe a new role for an old protein, hemoglobin, which in the ferric or methemoglobin state binds H2S and oxidizes it to a mixture of thiosulfate and hydropolysulfides. Our study reveals a previously undescribed route for the biogenesis of hydropolysulfides, which are increasingly considered important for H2S-based signaling, but their origin in mammalian cells is unknown. An NADPH/flavoprotein oxidoreductase system restores polysulfide-carrying hemoglobin derivatives to ferrous hemoglobin, thus completing the methemoglobin-dependent sulfide oxidation cycle. Methemoglobin-dependent sulfide oxidation in mammals is complex and has similarities to chemistry reported for the dissolution of iron oxides in sulfidic waters and during bioleaching of metal sulfides. The catalytic oxidation of H2S by hemoglobin explains how RBCs maintain low steady-state H2S levels in circulation, and suggests that additional hemeproteins might be involved in sulfide homeostasis in other tissues.	eng	8310	8320	The Journal of biological chemistry	290	13	2015	Mar	27	D000755/Q000235;D004229/Q000494;D004912/Q000378;D006451/Q000737;D006451/Q000235;D006801;D006862/Q000737;D006862/Q000378;D007700;D008706/Q000737;D009566/Q000494;D010084;D019163/Q000494;D013440/Q000378;D013885/Q000378	Anemia, Sickle Cell/genetics;Dithiothreitol/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemoglobin, Sickle/chemistry;Hemoglobin, Sickle/genetics;Humans;Hydrogen Sulfide/chemistry;Hydrogen Sulfide/metabolism;Kinetics;Methemoglobin/chemistry;Nitrates/pharmacology;Oxidation-Reduction;Reducing Agents/pharmacology;Sulfides/metabolism;Thiosulfates/metabolism	Vitvitsky V;Yadav PK;Kurthen A;Banerjee R	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M115.639831		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
875	25829192	Ribosomal protein L11- and retinol dehydrogenase 11-induced erythroid proliferation without erythropoietin in UT-7/Epo erythroleukemic cells.	Erythropoiesis is the process of proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of erythroid cells. Understanding these steps will help to elucidate the basis of specific diseases associated with abnormal production of red blood cells. In this study, we continued our efforts to identify genes involved in erythroid proliferation. Lentivirally transduced UT-7/Epo erythroleukemic cells expressing ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11) or retinol dehydrogenase 11 (RDH11) could proliferate in the absence of erythropoietin, and their cell-cycle profiles revealed G0/G1 prolongation and low percentages of apoptosis. RPL11-expressing cells proliferated more rapidly than the RDH11-expressing cells. The antiapoptotic proteins BCL-XL and BCL-2 were expressed in both cell lines. Unlike the parental UT-7/Epo cells, the expression of hemoglobins (Hbs) in the transduced cells had switched from adult to fetal type. Several signal transduction pathways, including STAT5, were highly activated in transduced cells; furthermore, expression of the downstream target genes of STAT5, such as CCND1, was upregulated in the transduced cells. Taken together, the data indicate that RPL11 and RDH11 accelerate erythroid cell proliferation by upregulating the STAT5 signaling pathway with phosphorylation of Lyn and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB).	eng	414	423.e1	Experimental hematology	43	5	2015	May		D017209/Q000235;D015153;D059447/Q000235;D045744;D049109/Q000187;D049109/Q000235;D017362/Q000378;D041905/Q000378;D004921/Q000494;D015870;D057809;D006801;D007150;D053614/Q000378;D004915/Q000235;D004915/Q000378;D004915/Q000473;D010088/Q000235;D010088/Q000378;D010766;D019253/Q000235;D019253/Q000378;D020133;D012269/Q000235;D012269/Q000378;D050799/Q000235;D050799/Q000378;D051020/Q000235;D051020/Q000378;D019061/Q000378	Apoptosis/genetics;Blotting, Western;Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics;Cell Line, Tumor;Cell Proliferation/drug effects;Cell Proliferation/genetics;Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism;Erythroid Cells/metabolism;Erythropoietin/pharmacology;Gene Expression;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Immunohistochemistry;Janus Kinase 2/metabolism;Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics;Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism;Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology;Oxidoreductases/genetics;Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Phosphorylation;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Ribosomal Proteins/genetics;Ribosomal Proteins/metabolism;STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics;STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism;bcl-X Protein/genetics;bcl-X Protein/metabolism;src-Family Kinases/metabolism	Kummalue T;Inoue T;Miura Y;Narusawa M;Inoue H;Komatsu N;Wanachiwanawin W;Sugiyama D;Tani K	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.exphem.2015.01.006		Erythro;red blood cell;erythro	True
876	26001274	Piezo1 links mechanical forces to red blood cell volume.	Red blood cells (RBCs) experience significant mechanical forces while recirculating, but the consequences of these forces are not fully understood. Recent work has shown that gain-of-function mutations in mechanically activated Piezo1 cation channels are associated with the dehydrating RBC disease xerocytosis, implicating a role of mechanotransduction in RBC volume regulation. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations result in RBC dehydration are unknown. In this study, we show that RBCs exhibit robust calcium entry in response to mechanical stretch and that this entry is dependent on Piezo1 expression. Furthermore, RBCs from blood-cell-specific Piezo1 conditional knockout mice are overhydrated and exhibit increased fragility both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Yoda1, a chemical activator of Piezo1, causes calcium influx and subsequent dehydration of RBCs via downstream activation of the KCa3.1 Gardos channel, directly implicating Piezo1 signaling in RBC volume control. Therefore, mechanically activated Piezo1 plays an essential role in RBC volume homeostasis.	eng			eLife	4		2015	May	22	D000704;D000818;D001696;D015153;D002118/Q000378;D017931/Q000235;D004797;D004906;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000502;D004912/Q000648;D005434;D005453;D007473/Q000235;D007473/Q000378;D007473/Q000502;D040542/Q000502;D051379;D018345;D008855;D009154/Q000235;D054852/Q000494	Analysis of Variance;Animals;Biomechanical Phenomena;Blotting, Western;Calcium/metabolism;DNA Primers/genetics;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Erythrocyte Count;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/physiology;Erythrocytes/ultrastructure;Flow Cytometry;Fluorescence;Ion Channels/genetics;Ion Channels/metabolism;Ion Channels/physiology;Mechanotransduction, Cellular/physiology;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Microscopy, Electron, Scanning;Mutation/genetics;Small Molecule Libraries/pharmacology	Cahalan SM;Lukacs V;Ranade SS;Chien S;Bandell M;Patapoutian A	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;Red blood cell	True
877	26611568	Accelerated apoptotic death and in vivo turnover of erythrocytes in mice lacking functional mitogen- and stress-activated kinase MSK1/2.	The mitogen- and stress-activated kinase MSK1/2 plays a decisive role in apoptosis. In analogy to apoptosis of nucleated cells, suicidal erythrocyte death called eryptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling leading to phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization. Here, we explored whether MSK1/2 participates in the regulation of eryptosis. To this end, erythrocytes were isolated from mice lacking functional MSK1/2 (msk(-/-)) and corresponding wild-type mice (msk(+/+)). Blood count, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration and mean erythrocyte volume were similar in both msk(-/-) and msk(+/+) mice, but reticulocyte count was significantly increased in msk(-/-) mice. Cell membrane PS exposure was similar in untreated msk(-/-) and msk(+/+) erythrocytes, but was enhanced by pathophysiological cell stressors ex vivo such as hyperosmotic shock or energy depletion to significantly higher levels in msk(-/-) erythrocytes than in msk(+/+) erythrocytes. Cell shrinkage following hyperosmotic shock and energy depletion, as well as hemolysis following decrease of extracellular osmolarity was more pronounced in msk(-/-) erythrocytes. The in vivo clearance of autologously-infused CFSE-labeled erythrocytes from circulating blood was faster in msk(-/-) mice. The spleens from msk(-/-) mice contained a significantly greater number of PS-exposing erythrocytes than spleens from msk(+/+) mice. The present observations point to accelerated eryptosis and subsequent clearance of erythrocytes leading to enhanced erythrocyte turnover in MSK1/2-deficient mice.	eng	17316		Scientific reports	5		2015	Nov	27	D000818;D017209/Q000235;D004909;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000473;D005260;D015870;D006400;D006454;D006461;D006801;D008297;D051379;D018345;D009996;D009997;D010718/Q000378;D061251;D017701;D038744/Q000172;D038744/Q000235	Animals;Apoptosis/genetics;Erythrocyte Indices;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/pathology;Female;Gene Expression;Hematocrit;Hemoglobins;Hemolysis;Humans;Male;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Osmotic Fragility;Osmotic Pressure;Phosphatidylserines/metabolism;Primary Cell Culture;Reticulocyte Count;Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa/deficiency;Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa/genetics	Lang E;Bissinger R;Fajol A;Salker MS;Singh Y;Zelenak C;Ghashghaeinia M;Gu S;Jilani K;Lupescu A;Reyskens KM;Ackermann TF;Föller M;Schleicher E;Sheffield WP;Arthur JS;Lang F;Qadri SM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
878	26271157	Proteome analysis of the triton-insoluble erythrocyte membrane skeleton.	"Erythrocyte shape and membrane integrity is imparted by the membrane skeleton, which can be isolated as a Triton X-100 insoluble structure that retains the biconcave shape of intact erythrocytes, indicating isolation of essentially intact membrane skeletons. These erythrocyte ""Triton Skeletons"" have been studied morphologically and biochemically, but unbiased proteome analysis of this substructure of the membrane has not been reported. In this study, different extraction buffers and in-depth proteome analyses were used to more fully define the protein composition of this functionally critical macromolecular complex. As expected, the major, well-characterized membrane skeleton proteins and their associated membrane anchors were recovered in good yield. But surprisingly, a substantial number of additional proteins that are not considered in erythrocyte membrane skeleton models were recovered in high yields, including myosin-9, lipid raft proteins (stomatin, flotillin1 and 2), multiple chaperone proteins (HSPs, protein disulfide isomerase and calnexin), and several other proteins. These results show that the membrane skeleton is substantially more complex than previous biochemical studies indicated, and it apparently has localized regions with unique protein compositions and functions. This comprehensive catalog of the membrane skeleton should lead to new insights into erythrocyte membrane biology and pathogenic mutations that perturb membrane stability. Biological significance Current models of erythrocyte membranes describe fairly simple homogenous structures that are incomplete. Proteome analysis of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton shows that it is quite complex and includes a substantial number of proteins whose roles and locations in the membrane are not well defined. Further elucidation of interactions involving these proteins and definition of microdomains in the membrane that contain these proteins should yield novel insights into how the membrane skeleton produces the normal biconcave erythrocyte shape and how it is perturbed in pathological conditions that destabilize the membrane."	eng	298	305	Journal of proteomics	128		2015	Oct	14	D002478;D004910/Q000737;D006801;D021962/Q000737;D008565/Q000737;D017830/Q000737;D020543/Q000032;D020543/Q000737;D012995	Cells, Cultured;Erythrocyte Membrane/chemistry;Humans;Membrane Microdomains/chemistry;Membrane Proteins/chemistry;Octoxynol/chemistry;Proteome/analysis;Proteome/chemistry;Solubility	Basu A;Harper S;Pesciotta EN;Speicher KD;Chakrabarti A;Speicher DW	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.jprot.2015.08.004		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
879	27136057	Personalized Whole-Cell Kinetic Models of Metabolism for Discovery in Genomics and Pharmacodynamics.	Understanding individual variation is fundamental to personalized medicine. Yet interpreting complex phenotype data, such as multi-compartment metabolomic profiles, in the context of genotype data for an individual is complicated by interactions within and between cells and remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we constructed multi-omic, data-driven, personalized whole-cell kinetic models of erythrocyte metabolism for 24 healthy individuals based on fasting-state plasma and erythrocyte metabolomics and whole-genome genotyping. We show that personalized kinetic rate constants, rather than metabolite levels, better represent the genotype. Additionally, changes in erythrocyte dynamics between individuals occur on timescales of circulation, suggesting detected differences play a role in physiology. Finally, we use the models to identify individuals at risk for a drug side effect (ribavirin-induced anemia) and how genetic variation (inosine triphosphatase deficiency) may protect against this side effect. This study demonstrates the feasibility of personalized kinetic models, and we anticipate their use will accelerate discoveries in characterizing individual metabolic variation.	eng	283	292	Cell systems	1	4	2015	Oct	28			Bordbar A;McCloskey D;Zielinski DC;Sonnenschein N;Jamshidi N;Palsson BO	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.cels.2015.10.003		erythrocyte	True
880	27239515	Alterations of membrane protein expression in red blood cells of Alzheimer's disease patients.	Preventive measures, prognosis, or selected therapy in multifactorial maladies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), require the application of a wide range of diagnostic assays. There is a large unmet need for relatively simple, blood-based biomarkers in this regard. We have recently developed a rapid and reliable flow cytometry and antibody-based method for the quantitative measurement of various red blood cell (RBC) membrane proteins from a drop of blood. Here, we document that the RBC expression of certain membrane proteins, especially that of the GLUT1 transporter and the insulin receptor (INSR), is significantly higher in AD patients than in age-matched healthy subjects. The observed differences may reflect long-term metabolic alterations relevant in the development of AD. These findings may pave the way for a diagnostic application of RBC membrane proteins as relatively stable and easily accessible personalized biomarkers in AD.	eng	334	338	Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	1	3	2015	Sep				Várady G;Szabó E;Fehér Á;Németh A;Zámbó B;Pákáski M;Janka Z;Sarkadi B	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.dadm.2015.06.007		RBC;red blood cell	True
881	26205815	Characterization of a single b-type heme, FAD, and metal binding sites in the transmembrane domain of six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP) family proteins.	Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3 (Steap3) is the major ferric reductase in developing erythrocytes. Steap family proteins are defined by a shared transmembrane domain that in Steap3 has been shown to function as a transmembrane electron shuttle, moving cytoplasmic electrons derived from NADPH across the lipid bilayer to the extracellular face where they are used to reduce Fe(3+) to Fe(2+) and potentially Cu(2+) to Cu(1+). Although the cytoplasmic N-terminal oxidoreductase domain of Steap3 and Steap4 are relatively well characterized, little work has been done to characterize the transmembrane domain of any member of the Steap family. Here we identify high affinity FAD and iron biding sites and characterize a single b-type heme binding site in the Steap3 transmembrane domain. Furthermore, we show that Steap3 is functional as a homodimer and that it utilizes an intrasubunit electron transfer pathway through the single heme moiety rather than an intersubunit electron pathway through a potential domain-swapped dimer. Importantly, the sequence motifs in the transmembrane domain that are associated with the FAD and metal binding sites are not only present in Steap2 and Steap4 but also in Steap1, which lacks the N-terminal oxidoreductase domain. This strongly suggests that Steap1 harbors latent oxidoreductase activity.	eng	22558	22569	The Journal of biological chemistry	290	37	2015	Sep	11	D000951/Q000235;D000951/Q000378;D003300/Q000378;D005182/Q000235;D005182/Q000378;D057809;D006418/Q000235;D006418/Q000378;D006801;D007501/Q000378;D009249/Q000235;D009249/Q000378;D055503/Q000502;D017434	Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics;Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism;Copper/metabolism;Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide/genetics;Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide/metabolism;HEK293 Cells;Heme/genetics;Heme/metabolism;Humans;Iron/metabolism;NADP/genetics;NADP/metabolism;Protein Multimerization/physiology;Protein Structure, Tertiary	Kleven MD;Dlakić M;Lawrence CM	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M115.664565		erythrocyte	True
882	26351678	Piezo1 regulates mechanotransductive release of ATP from human RBCs.	Piezo proteins (Piezo1 and Piezo2) are recently identified mechanically activated cation channels in eukaryotic cells and associated with physiological responses to touch, pressure, and stretch. In particular, human RBCs express Piezo1 on their membranes, and mutations of Piezo1 have been linked to hereditary xerocytosis. To date, however, physiological functions of Piezo1 on normal RBCs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Piezo1 regulates mechanotransductive release of ATP from human RBCs by controlling the shear-induced calcium (Ca(2+)) influx. We find that, in human RBCs treated with Piezo1 inhibitors or having mutant Piezo1 channels, the amounts of shear-induced ATP release and Ca(2+) influx decrease significantly. Remarkably, a critical extracellular Ca(2+) concentration is required to trigger significant ATP release, but membrane-associated ATP pools in RBCs also contribute to the release of ATP. Our results show how Piezo1 channels are likely to function in normal RBCs and suggest a previously unidentified mechanotransductive pathway in ATP release. Thus, we anticipate that the study will impact broadly on the research of red cells, cellular mechanosensing, and clinical studies related to red cell disorders and vascular disease.	eng	11783	11788	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	112	38	2015	Sep	22	D000255/Q000378;D002118/Q000378;D002138;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005110/Q000378;D006801;D007473/Q000378;D040542;D044085;D008954;D033081	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Calcium/metabolism;Calibration;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Extracellular Space/metabolism;Humans;Ion Channels/metabolism;Mechanotransduction, Cellular;Microfluidics;Models, Biological;Shear Strength	Cinar E;Zhou S;DeCourcey J;Wang Y;Waugh RE;Wan J	Journal, Articles					10.1073/pnas.1507309112		RBC;Erythrocyte;red cell	True

884	27156251	The role of red blood cell S-nitrosation in nitrite bioactivation and its modulation by leucine and glucose.	Previous work has shown that red blood cells (RBCs) reduce nitrite to NO under conditions of low oxygen. Strong support for the ability of red blood cells to promote nitrite bioactivation comes from using platelet activation as a NO-sensitive process. Whereas addition of nitrite to platelet rich plasma in the absence of RBCs has no effect on inhibition of platelet activation, when RBCs are present platelet activation is inhibited by an NO-dependent mechanism that is potentiated under hypoxia. In this paper, we demonstrate that nitrite bioactivation by RBCs is blunted by physiologically-relevant concentrations of nutrients including glucose and the important signaling amino acid leucine. Our mechanistic investigations demonstrate that RBC mediated nitrite bioactivation is largely dependent on nitrosation of RBC surface proteins. These data suggest a new expanded paradigm where RBC mediated nitrite bioactivation not only directs blood flow to areas of low oxygen but also to areas of low nutrients. Our findings could have profound implications for normal physiology as well as pathophysiology in a variety of diseases including diabetes, sickle cell disease, and arteriosclerosis.	eng	415	421	Redox biology	8		2016	Aug		D004912/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D006801;D007930/Q000378;D009569/Q000378;D009573/Q000378;D015538;D010100/Q000378;D014664	Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Humans;Leucine/metabolism;Nitric Oxide/metabolism;Nitrites/metabolism;Nitrosation;Oxygen/metabolism;Vasodilation	Wajih N;Liu X;Shetty P;Basu S;Wu H;Hogg N;Patel RP;Furdui CM;Kim-Shapiro DB	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.redox.2016.04.004		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
885	27777340	Multi-omics Evidence for Inheritance of Energy Pathways in Red Blood Cells.	Each year over 90 million units of blood are transfused worldwide. Our dependence on this blood supply mandates optimized blood management and storage. During storage, red blood cells undergo degenerative processes resulting in altered metabolic characteristics which may make blood less viable for transfusion. However, not all stored blood spoils at the same rate, a difference that has been attributed to variable rates of energy usage and metabolism in red blood cells. Specific metabolite abundances are heritable traits; however, the link between heritability of energy metabolism and red blood cell storage profiles is unclear. Herein we performed a comprehensive metabolomics and proteomics study of red blood cells from 18 mono- and di-zygotic twin pairs to measure heritability and identify correlations with ATP and other molecular indices of energy metabolism. Without using affinity-based hemoglobin depletion, our work afforded the deepest multi-omic characterization of red blood cell membranes to date (1280 membrane proteins and 330 metabolites), with 119 membrane protein and 148 metabolite concentrations found to be over 30% heritable. We demonstrate a high degree of heritability in the concentration of energy metabolism metabolites, especially glycolytic metabolites. In addition to being heritable, proteins and metabolites involved in glycolysis and redox metabolism are highly correlated, suggesting that crucial energy metabolism pathways are inherited en bloc at distinct levels. We conclude that individuals can inherit a phenotype composed of higher or lower concentrations of these proteins together. This can result in vastly different red blood cells storage profiles which may need to be considered to develop precise and individualized storage options. Beyond guiding proper blood storage, this intimate link in heritability between energy and redox metabolism pathways may someday prove useful in determining the predisposition of an individual toward metabolic diseases.	eng	3614	3623	Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP	15	12	2016	Dec		D000293;D000328;D001771;D001793;D004734;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D008297;D008565/Q000378;D055432/Q000379;D040901/Q000379;D019655;D014429;D014430;D055815	Adolescent;Adult;Blood Banks;Blood Preservation;Energy Metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Male;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Metabolomics/methods;Proteomics/methods;Quantitative Trait, Heritable;Twins, Dizygotic;Twins, Monozygotic;Young Adult	Weisenhorn EM;van T Erve TJ;Riley NM;Hess JR;Raife TJ;Coon JJ	Journal, Articles							red blood cell;Erythrocyte;Red Blood Cell	True

Zinc is an essential nutrient for humans; however, a sensitive biomarker to assess zinc status has not been identified. The objective of this systematic review was to compile and assess studies that determined zinc transporter and/or metallothionein expression in various blood cell types and to determine their reliability and sensitivity to changes in dietary zinc. Sixteen studies were identified that determined the expression of zrt-, irt-like protein (ZIP) 1 [solute carrier family (SLC) 39A1], ZIP3 (SLC39A3), ZIP5 (SLC39A5), ZIP6 (SLC39A6), ZIP7 (SLC39A7), ZIP8 (SLC39A8), ZIP10 (SLC39A10), ZIP14 (SLC39A14), zinc transporter (ZnT)1 (SLC30A1), ZnT2 (SLC30A2), ZnT4 (SLC30A4), ZnT5 (SLC30A5), ZnT6 (SLC30A6), ZnT7 (SLC30A7), ZnT9 (SLC30A9), and/or metallothionein in various blood cells isolated from healthy adult men and women in response to zinc supplementation or depletion. Cell types included leukocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T lymphocytes, monocytes, and erythrocytes. ZIP1, ZnT1, and metallothionein were the most commonly measured proteins. Changes in ZIP1 and ZnT1 in response to zinc supplementation or depletion were not consistent across studies. Leukocyte metallothionein decreased with zinc depletion (-39% change from baseline, <5 mg Zn/d, n = 2 studies) and increased with zinc supplementation in a dose-dependent manner (35%, 15-22 mg Zn/d, n = 7 studies; 267%, 50 mg Zn/d, n = 2 studies) and at the earliest time points measured; however, no change or delayed response was observed in metallothionein in erythrocytes. A greater percentage of studies demonstrated that metallothionein in leukocyte subtypes was a more reliable (100%, n = 12; 69%, n = 16) and responsive (92%, n = 12; 82%, n = 11) indicator of zinc exposure than was plasma zinc, respectively. In conclusion, current evidence indicates that metallothionein in leukocyte subtypes may be a component in determining zinc status.	eng	735	746	Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)	7	4	2016	Jul		D015415/Q000097;D002352/Q000097;D027682/Q000097;D004032;D019587;D006801;D007962/Q000378;D008668/Q000097;D009752;D015032/Q000097	Biomarkers/blood;Carrier Proteins/blood;Cation Transport Proteins/blood;Diet;Dietary Supplements;Humans;Leukocytes/metabolism;Metallothionein/blood;Nutritional Status;Zinc/blood	Hennigar SR;Kelley AM;McClung JP	Journal, Articles					10.3945/an.116.012518		erythrocyte	True
889	27436223	Hypoxia-mediated impaired erythrocyte Lands' Cycle is pathogenic for sickle cell disease.	Although Lands' cycle was discovered in 1958, its function and cellular regulation in membrane homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions remain largely unknown. Nonbiased high throughput metabolomic profiling revealed that Lands' cycle was impaired leading to significantly elevated erythrocyte membrane lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) content and circulating and erythrocyte arachidonic acid (AA) in mice with sickle cell disease (SCD), a prevalent hemolytic genetic disorder. Correcting imbalanced Lands' cycle by knockdown of phospholipase 2 (cPLA2) or overexpression of lysophosphatidycholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1), two key enzymes of Lands' cycle in hematopoietic stem cells, reduced elevated erythrocyte membrane LysoPC content and circulating AA levels and attenuated sickling, inflammation and tissue damage in SCD chimeras. Human translational studies validated SCD mouse findings and further demonstrated that imbalanced Lands' cycle induced LysoPC production directly promotes sickling in cultured mouse and human SCD erythrocytes. Mechanistically, we revealed that hypoxia-mediated ERK activation underlies imbalanced Lands' cycle by preferentially inducing the activity of PLA2 but not LPCAT in human and mouse SCD erythrocytes. Overall, our studies have identified a pathological role of imbalanced Lands' cycle in SCD erythrocytes, novel molecular basis regulating Lands' cycle and therapeutic opportunities for the disease.	eng	29637		Scientific reports	6		2016	Jul	20	D008243/Q000235;D000755/Q000097;D000755/Q000235;D000755/Q000378;D000818;D016718/Q000097;D015687;D002478;D004195;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D055785;D054513/Q000235;D006801;D008244/Q000378;D008297;D055432/Q000379;D051379	1-Acylglycerophosphocholine O-Acyltransferase/genetics;Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood;Anemia, Sickle Cell/genetics;Anemia, Sickle Cell/metabolism;Animals;Arachidonic Acid/blood;Cell Hypoxia;Cells, Cultured;Disease Models, Animal;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Gene Knockdown Techniques;Group IV Phospholipases A2/genetics;Humans;Lysophosphatidylcholines/metabolism;Male;Metabolomics/methods;Mice	Wu H;Bogdanov M;Zhang Y;Sun K;Zhao S;Song A;Luo R;Parchim NF;Liu H;Huang A;Adebiyi MG;Jin J;Alexander DC;Milburn MV;Idowu M;Juneja HS;Kellems RE;Dowhan W;Xia Y	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
890	27470541	Oxidation and interaction of DJ-1 with 20S proteasome in the erythrocytes of early stage Parkinson's disease patients.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, age-related, neurodegenerative disorder, and oxidative stress is an important mediator in its pathogenesis. DJ-1, the product of the causative gene of a familial form of PD, plays a significant role in anti-oxidative defence to protect cells from oxidative stress. DJ-1 undergoes preferential oxidation at the cysteine residue at position 106 (Cys-106) under oxidative stress. Here, using specific antibodies against Cys-106-oxidized DJ-1 (oxDJ-1), it was found that the levels of oxDJ-1 in the erythrocytes of unmedicated PD patients (n = 88) were higher than in those of medicated PD patients (n = 62) and healthy control subjects (n = 33). Elevated oxDJ-1 levels were also observed in a non-human primate PD model. Biochemical analysis of oxDJ-1 in erythrocyte lysates showed that oxDJ-1 formed dimer and polymer forms, and that the latter interacts with 20S proteasome. These results clearly indicate a biochemical alteration in the blood of PD patients, which could be utilized as an early diagnosis marker for PD.	eng	30793		Scientific reports	6		2016	Jul	29	D000368;D000818;D003545/Q000737;D004195;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D007980/Q000627;D008252;D008297;D008875;D018384;D010300/Q000097;D010300/Q000188;D010300/Q000378;D046988/Q000378;D000071617/Q000737;D000071617/Q000378;D055503	Aged;Animals;Cysteine/chemistry;Disease Models, Animal;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Levodopa/therapeutic use;Macaca fascicularis;Male;Middle Aged;Oxidative Stress;Parkinson Disease/blood;Parkinson Disease/drug therapy;Parkinson Disease/metabolism;Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism;Protein Deglycase DJ-1/chemistry;Protein Deglycase DJ-1/metabolism;Protein Multimerization	Saito Y;Akazawa-Ogawa Y;Matsumura A;Saigoh K;Itoh S;Sutou K;Kobayashi M;Mita Y;Shichiri M;Hisahara S;Hara Y;Fujimura H;Takamatsu H;Hagihara Y;Yoshida Y;Hamakubo T;Kusunoki S;Shimohama S;Noguchi N	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
891	27006477	Comparison of the Proteome of Adult and Cord Erythroid Cells, and Changes in the Proteome Following Reticulocyte Maturation.	Cord blood stem cells are an attractive starting source for the production of red blood cells in vitro for therapy because of additional expansion potential compared with adult peripheral blood progenitors and cord blood banks usually being more representative of national populations than blood donors. Consequently, it is important to establish how similar cord RBCs are to adult cells. In this study, we used multiplex tandem mass tag labeling combined with nano-LC-MS/MS to compare the proteome of adult and cord RBCs and reticulocytes. 2838 unique proteins were identified, providing the most comprehensive compendium of RBC proteins to date. Using stringent criteria, 1674 proteins were quantified, and only a small number differed in amount between adult and cord RBC. We focused on proteins critical for RBC function. Of these, only the expected differences in globin subunits, along with higher levels of carbonic anhydrase 1 and 2 and aquaporin-1 in adult RBCs would be expected to have a phenotypic effect since they are associated with the differences in gaseous exchange between adults and neonates. Since the RBC and reticulocyte samples used were autologous, we catalogue the change in proteome following reticulocyte maturation. The majority of proteins (>60% of the 1671 quantified) reduced in abundance between 2- and 100-fold following maturation. However, ∼5% were at a higher level in RBCs, localized almost exclusively to cell membranes, in keeping with the known clearance of intracellular recycling pools during reticulocyte maturation. Overall, these data suggest that, with respect to the proteome, there is no barrier to the use of cord progenitors for the in vitro generation of RBCs for transfusion to adults other than the expression of fetal, not adult, hemoglobin.	eng	1938	1946	Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP	15	6	2016	Jun		D000328;D024401/Q000378;D024402/Q000378;D002454;D002853;D041905/Q000166;D041905/Q000378;D005312/Q000166;D005312/Q000378;D006801;D007231;D020543/Q000032;D040901/Q000379;D012156/Q000166;D012156/Q000378;D053719	Adult;Carbonic Anhydrase I/metabolism;Carbonic Anhydrase II/metabolism;Cell Differentiation;Chromatography, Liquid;Erythroid Cells/cytology;Erythroid Cells/metabolism;Fetal Blood/cytology;Fetal Blood/metabolism;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Proteome/analysis;Proteomics/methods;Reticulocytes/cytology;Reticulocytes/metabolism;Tandem Mass Spectrometry	Wilson MC;Trakarnsanga K;Heesom KJ;Cogan N;Green C;Toye AM;Parsons SF;Anstee DJ;Frayne J	Journal, Articles					10.1074/mcp.M115.057315		RBC;Erythro;red blood cell	True
892	27341449	Identification of Novel Genetic Determinants of Erythrocyte Membrane Fatty Acid Composition among Greenlanders.	Fatty acids (FAs) are involved in cellular processes important for normal body function, and perturbation of FA balance has been linked to metabolic disturbances, including type 2 diabetes. An individual's level of FAs is affected by diet, lifestyle, and genetic variation. We aimed to improve the understanding of the mechanisms and pathways involved in regulation of FA tissue levels, by identifying genetic loci associated with inter-individual differences in erythrocyte membrane FA levels. We assessed the levels of 22 FAs in the phospholipid fraction of erythrocyte membranes from 2,626 Greenlanders in relation to single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped on the MetaboChip or imputed. We identified six independent association signals. Novel loci were identified on chromosomes 5 and 11 showing strongest association with oleic acid (rs76430747 in ACSL6, beta (SE): -0.386% (0.034), p = 1.8x10-28) and docosahexaenoic acid (rs6035106 in DTD1, 0.137% (0.025), p = 6.4x10-8), respectively. For a missense variant (rs80356779) in CPT1A, we identified a number of novel FA associations, the strongest with 11-eicosenoic acid (0.473% (0.035), p = 2.6x10-38), and for variants in FADS2 (rs174570), LPCAT3 (rs2110073), and CERS4 (rs11881630) we replicated known FA associations. Moreover, we observed metabolic implications of the ACSL6 (rs76430747) and CPT1A (rs80356779) variants, which both were associated with altered HbA1c (0.051% (0.013), p = 5.6x10-6 and -0.034% (0.016), p = 3.1x10-4, respectively). The latter variant was also associated with reduced insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, -0.193 (0.050), p = 3.8x10-6), as well as measures of smaller body size, including weight (-2.676 kg (0.523), p = 2.4x10-7), lean mass (-1.200 kg (0.271), p = 1.7x10-6), height (-0.966 cm (0.230), p = 2.0x10-5), and BMI (-0.638 kg/m2 (0.181), p = 2.8x10-4). In conclusion, we have identified novel genetic determinants of FA composition in phospholipids in erythrocyte membranes, and have shown examples of links between genetic variants associated with altered FA membrane levels and changes in metabolic traits.	eng	e1006119		PLoS genetics	12	6	2016	Jun		D049628/Q000235;D002334/Q000235;D003066/Q000235;D003924/Q000235;D004281/Q000235;D004910/Q000235;D005227/Q000235;D005229/Q000378;D005260;D056426/Q000235;D005838;D006442/Q000235;D006116;D006801;D007328/Q000235;D007333/Q000235;D008297;D019301/Q000235;D010743/Q000235;D020641/Q000235	Body Size/genetics;Carnitine O-Palmitoyltransferase/genetics;Coenzyme A Ligases/genetics;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/genetics;Docosahexaenoic Acids/genetics;Erythrocyte Membrane/genetics;Fatty Acids/genetics;Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/metabolism;Female;Genetic Loci/genetics;Genotype;Glycated Hemoglobin/genetics;Greenland;Humans;Insulin/genetics;Insulin Resistance/genetics;Male;Oleic Acid/genetics;Phospholipids/genetics;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics	Andersen MK;Jørsboe E;Sandholt CH;Grarup N;Jørgensen ME;Færgeman NJ;Bjerregaard P;Pedersen O;Moltke I;Hansen T;Albrechtsen A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
893	27166256	Zinc- and bicarbonate-dependent ZIP8 transporter mediates selenite uptake.	Selenite (HSeO3-) is a monovalent anion of the essential trace element and micronutrient selenium (Se). In therapeutic concentrations, HSeO3- has been studied for treating certain cancers, serious inflammatory disorders, and septic shock. Little is known, however, about HSeO3- uptake into mammalian cells; until now, no mammalian HSeO3- uptake transporter has been identified. The ubiquitous mammalian ZIP8 divalent cation transporter (encoded by the SLC39A8 gene) is bicarbonate-dependent, moving endogenous substrates (Zn2+, Mn2+, Fe2+ or Co2+) and nonessential metals such as Cd2+ into the cell. Herein we studied HSeO3- uptake in: human and mouse cell cultures, shRNA-knockdown experiments, Xenopus oocytes, wild-type mice and two transgenic mouse lines having genetically altered ZIP8 expression, and mouse erythrocytes ex vivo. In mammalian cell culture, excess Zn2+ levels and/or ZIP8 over-expression can be associated with diminished viability in selenite-treated cells. Intraperitoneal HSeO3- causes the largest ZIP8-dependent increases in intracellular Se content in liver, followed by kidney, heart, lung and spleen. In every model system studied, HSeO3- uptake is tightly associated with ZIP8 protein levels and sufficient Zn2+ and HCO3- concentrations, suggesting that the ZIP8-mediated electroneutral complex transported contains three ions: Zn2+/(HCO3-)(HSeO3-). Transporters having three different ions in their transport complex are not without precedent. Although there might be other HSeO3- influx transporters as yet undiscovered, data herein suggest that mammalian ZIP8 plays a major role in HSeO3- uptake.	eng	35327	35340	Oncotarget	7	23	2016	Jun	07	D000818;D001639/Q000378;D027682/Q000378;D006801;D017136/Q000502;D051379;D020887/Q000378;D014981;D015032/Q000378	Animals;Bicarbonates/metabolism;Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism;Humans;Ion Transport/physiology;Mice;Selenious Acid/metabolism;Xenopus;Zinc/metabolism	McDermott JR;Geng X;Jiang L;Gálvez-Peralta M;Chen F;Nebert DW;Liu Z	Journal, Articles					10.18632/oncotarget.9205		erythrocyte	True
894	26944472	ATP11C is a major flippase in human erythrocytes and its defect causes congenital hemolytic anemia.	Phosphatidylserine is localized exclusively to the inner leaflet of the membrane lipid bilayer of most cells, including erythrocytes. This asymmetric distribution is critical for the survival of erythrocytes in circulation since externalized phosphatidylserine is a phagocytic signal for splenic macrophages. Flippases are P-IV ATPase family proteins that actively transport phosphatidylserine from the outer to inner leaflet. It has not yet been determined which of the 14 members of this family of proteins is the flippase in human erythrocytes. Herein, we report that ATP11C encodes a major flippase in human erythrocytes, and a genetic mutation identified in a male patient caused congenital hemolytic anemia inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Phosphatidylserine internalization in erythrocytes with the mutant ATP11C was decreased 10-fold compared to that of the control, functionally establishing that ATP11C is a major flippase in human erythrocytes. Contrary to our expectations phosphatidylserine was retained in the inner leaflet of the majority of mature erythrocytes from both controls and the patient, suggesting that phosphatidylserine cannot be externalized as long as scramblase is inactive. Phosphatidylserine-exposing cells were found only in the densest senescent cells (0.1% of total) in which scramblase was activated by increased Ca(2+) concentration: the percentage of these phosphatidylserine-exposing cells was increased in the patient's senescent cells accounting for his mild anemia. Furthermore, the finding of similar extents of phosphatidylserine exposure by exogenous Ca(2+)-activated scrambling in both control erythrocytes and the patient's erythrocytes implies that suppressed scramblase activity rather than flippase activity contributes to the maintenance of phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of human erythrocytes.	eng	559	565	Haematologica	101	5	2016	May		D000251/Q000172;D000251/Q000235;D000251/Q000378;D000293;D000745/Q000175;D000745/Q000235;D000745/Q000378;D001693;D015415;D002118/Q000378;D004909;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D008297;D026901/Q000172;D026901/Q000235;D026901/Q000378;D009154;D010718/Q000378;D010718/Q000494	Adenosine Triphosphatases/deficiency;Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics;Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism;Adolescent;Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital/diagnosis;Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital/genetics;Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital/metabolism;Biological Transport, Active;Biomarkers;Calcium/metabolism;Erythrocyte Indices;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Male;Membrane Transport Proteins/deficiency;Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics;Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism;Mutation;Phosphatidylserines/metabolism;Phosphatidylserines/pharmacology	Arashiki N;Takakuwa Y;Mohandas N;Hale J;Yoshida K;Ogura H;Utsugisawa T;Ohga S;Miyano S;Ogawa S;Kojima S;Kanno H	Journal, Articles					10.3324/haematol.2016.142273		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

897	27646145	AltitudeOmics: Red Blood Cell Metabolic Adaptation to High Altitude Hypoxia.	Red blood cells (RBCs) are key players in systemic oxygen transport. RBCs respond to in vitro hypoxia through the so-called oxygen-dependent metabolic regulation, which involves the competitive binding of deoxyhemoglobin and glycolytic enzymes to the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3. This mechanism promotes the accumulation of 2,3-DPG, stabilizing the deoxygenated state of hemoglobin, and cytosol acidification, triggering oxygen off-loading through the Bohr effect. Despite in vitro studies, in vivo adaptations to hypoxia have not yet been completely elucidated. Within the framework of the AltitudeOmics study, erythrocytes were collected from 21 healthy volunteers at sea level, after exposure to high altitude (5260 m) for 1, 7, and 16 days, and following reascent after 7 days at 1525 m. UHPLC-MS metabolomics results were correlated to physiological and athletic performance parameters. Immediate metabolic adaptations were noted as early as a few hours from ascending to >5000 m, and maintained for 16 days at high altitude. Consistent with the mechanisms elucidated in vitro, hypoxia promoted glycolysis and deregulated the pentose phosphate pathway, as well purine catabolism, glutathione homeostasis, arginine/nitric oxide, and sulfur/H<sub>2</sub>S metabolism. Metabolic adaptations were preserved 1 week after descent, consistently with improved physical performances in comparison to the first ascendance, suggesting a mechanism of metabolic memory.	eng	3883	3895	Journal of proteome research	15	10	2016	Oct	07	D000064/Q000502;D000222;D000328;D000531;D000532/Q000378;D000532/Q000503;D001120/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005978/Q000378;D006019;D064368;D006801;D010427;D011687/Q000378;D013455/Q000378;D013997;D055815	Acclimatization/physiology;Adaptation, Physiological;Adult;Altitude;Altitude Sickness/metabolism;Altitude Sickness/physiopathology;Arginine/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glutathione/metabolism;Glycolysis;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Pentose Phosphate Pathway;Purines/metabolism;Sulfur/metabolism;Time Factors;Young Adult	D'Alessandro A;Nemkov T;Sun K;Liu H;Song A;Monte AA;Subudhi AW;Lovering AT;Dvorkin D;Julian CG;Kevil CG;Kolluru GK;Shiva S;Gladwin MT;Xia Y;Hansen KC;Roach RC	Journal, Articles							Red Blood Cell;Erythrocyte;Red blood cell;erythrocyte;RBC	True
898		Human erythrocyte ammonium transport is mediated by functional interaction of ammonium (RhAG) and anion (AE1) transporters.	The ammonia/ammonium (NH3/NH4+) influx into red blood cells (RBCs) is mediated by surface glycoprotein RhAG that forms a structural complex with anion exchanger 1 (AE1, band 3). Owing to the activity of this complex, RBCs exposed to the isosmotic ammonium buffer swell and finally lyse. Isoosmotic NH4+-containing media alters the pH gradient in RBCs (intracellular alkalosis in response to NH3/NH4+influx) and triggers the AE1 activity resulting in redundant chloride and water influx and finally in cell swelling. Here we demonstrate that the ammonia/ammonium transport in human RBCs depends on the pH (pH optimum 7.4 �0.1), temperature (Q10 2.6 �0.3), HCO3_concentration (EC50 4.7 �0.3 mM), and AE1 function. The data confirm functional interactions between AE1 and RhAG. The initial velocity of cell swelling increased almost 50-fold in the isosmotic ammonium buffer containing 25 mM HCO3_(37�C) in comparison to the reaction in the same buffer without HCO3_. This indicates that the reaction is facilitated mostly by the carrier proteins, not just owing to the simple diffusion of NH3 across the erythrocyte membrane. We demonstrate that pHi reaches its maximum value much faster than the volume increase does. These data suggest that there is no direct correlation between pHi changes and the influx of NH3/NH4+. Taken together, our data show that the RhAG and AE1 complex activity enables erythrocytes to be ammonia/ammonium storage sites in order to maintain the physiological blood ammonia/ammonium equilibrium.		301	310	Biochemistry (Moscow) Supplement Series A: Membrane and Cell Biology	10	4	2016	Oct	1			Sudnitsyna, JS, Skvertchinskaya, EA, Dobrylko IA, Nikitina ER, Krivchenko AI, Gambaryan SP, Mindukshev IV	Journal, Article					10.1134/S1990747816040097		RBC;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
899	27641616	TSPO ligands stimulate ZnPPIX transport and ROS accumulation leading to the inhibition of P. falciparum growth in human blood.	After invading red blood cells (RBCs), Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) can export its own proteins to the host membrane and activate endogenous channels that are present in the membrane of RBCs. This transport pathway involves the Voltage Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC). Moreover, ligands of the VDAC partner TranSlocator PrOtein (TSPO) were demonstrated to inhibit the growth of the parasite. We studied the expression of TSPO and VDAC isoforms in late erythroid precursors, examined the presence of these proteins in membranes of non-infected and infected human RBCs, and evaluated the efficiency of TSPO ligands in inhibiting plasmodium growth, transporting the haem analogue Zn-protoporphyrin-IX (ZnPPIX) and enhancing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). TSPO and VDAC isoforms are differentially expressed on erythroid cells in late differentiation states. TSPO2 and VDAC are present in the membranes of mature RBCs in a unique protein complex that changes the affinity of TSPO ligands after Pf infection. TSPO ligands dose-dependently inhibited parasite growth, and this inhibition was correlated to ZnPPIX uptake and ROS accumulation in the infected RBCs. Our results demonstrate that TSPO ligands can induce Pf death by increasing the uptake of porphyrins through a TSPO2-VDAC complex, which leads to an accumulation of ROS.	eng	33516		Scientific reports	6		2016	Sep	19	D000595;D000818;D018952/Q000378;D001692;D002454;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000469;D041905/Q000166;D041905/Q000378;D020869;D005978/Q000378;D006801;D008024;D013058;D010271/Q000254;D010963/Q000254;D020033/Q000235;D020033/Q000378;D011524/Q000378;D012333/Q000235;D012333/Q000378;D017382/Q000378;D018079/Q000737;D018079/Q000235;D018079/Q000378;D050994/Q000737;D050994/Q000378	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Antigens, CD34/metabolism;Biological Transport;Cell Differentiation;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Erythroid Cells/cytology;Erythroid Cells/metabolism;Gene Expression Profiling;Glutathione/metabolism;Humans;Ligands;Mass Spectrometry;Parasites/growth & development;Plasmodium falciparum/growth & development;Protein Isoforms/genetics;Protein Isoforms/metabolism;Protoporphyrins/metabolism;RNA, Messenger/genetics;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism;Receptors, GABA/chemistry;Receptors, GABA/genetics;Receptors, GABA/metabolism;Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels/chemistry;Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels/metabolism	Marginedas-Freixa I;Hattab C;Bouyer G;Halle F;Chene A;Lefevre SD;Cambot M;Cueff A;Schmitt M;Gamain B;Lacapere JJ;Egee S;Bihel F;Le Van Kim C;Ostuni MA	Journal, Articles							Erythro;Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;RBC	True
900	27405778	Oxidative modifications of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase regulate metabolic reprogramming of stored red blood cells.	Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) plays a key regulatory function in glucose oxidation by mediating fluxes through glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in an oxidative stress-dependent fashion. Previous studies documented metabolic reprogramming in stored red blood cells (RBCs) and oxidation of GAPDH at functional residues upon exposure to pro-oxidants diamide and H2O2 Here we hypothesize that routine storage of erythrocyte concentrates promotes metabolic modulation of stored RBCs by targeting functional thiol residues of GAPDH. Progressive increases in PPP/glycolysis ratios were determined via metabolic flux analysis after spiking (13)C1,2,3-glucose in erythrocyte concentrates stored in Additive Solution-3 under blood bank conditions for up to 42 days. Proteomics analyses revealed a storage-dependent oxidation of GAPDH at functional Cys152, 156, 247, and His179. Activity loss by oxidation occurred with increasing storage duration and was progressively irreversible. Irreversibly oxidized GAPDH accumulated in stored erythrocyte membranes and supernatants through storage day 42. By combining state-of-the-art ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolic flux analysis with redox and switch-tag proteomics, we identify for the first time ex vivo functionally relevant reversible and irreversible (sulfinic acid; Cys to dehydroalanine) oxidations of GAPDH without exogenous supplementation of excess pro-oxidant compounds in clinically relevant blood products. Oxidative and metabolic lesions, exacerbated by storage under hyperoxic conditions, were ameliorated by hypoxic storage. Storage-dependent reversible oxidation of GAPDH represents a mechanistic adaptation in stored erythrocytes to promote PPP activation and generate reducing equivalents. Removal of irreversibly oxidized, functionally compromised GAPDH identifies enhanced vesiculation as a self-protective mechanism in ex vivo aging erythrocytes.	eng	e32	e42	Blood	128	12	2016	Sep	22	D001793;D004912/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D024601/Q000737;D024601/Q000378;D006019;D006801;D055432;D010084;D018384;D017382/Q000378;D053719	Blood Preservation;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (NADP+)/chemistry;Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (NADP+)/metabolism;Glycolysis;Humans;Metabolomics;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism;Tandem Mass Spectrometry	Reisz JA;Wither MJ;Dzieciatkowska M;Nemkov T;Issaian A;Yoshida T;Dunham AJ;Hill RC;Hansen KC;D'Alessandro A	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood-2016-05-714816		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
901	27554084	Biomarkers defining the metabolic age of red blood cells during cold storage.	Metabolomic investigations of packed red blood cells (RBCs) stored under refrigerated conditions in saline adenine glucose mannitol (SAGM) additives have revealed the presence of 3 distinct metabolic phases, occurring on days 0-10, 10-18, and after day 18 of storage. Here we used receiving operating characteristics curve analysis to identify biomarkers that can differentiate between the 3 metabolic states. We first recruited 24 donors and analyzed 308 samples coming from RBC concentrates stored in SAGM and additive solution 3. We found that 8 extracellular compounds (lactic acid, nicotinamide, 5-oxoproline, xanthine, hypoxanthine, glucose, malic acid, and adenine) form the basis for an accurate classification/regression model and are able to differentiate among the metabolic phases. This model was then validated by analyzing an additional 49 samples obtained by preparing 7 new RBC concentrates in SAGM. Despite the technical variability associated with RBC processing strategies, verification of these markers was independently confirmed in 2 separate laboratories with different analytical setups and different sample sets. The 8 compounds proposed here highly correlate with the metabolic age of packed RBCs, and can be prospectively validated as biomarkers of the RBC metabolic lesion.	eng	e43	e50	Blood	128	13	2016	Sep	29	D000328;D015415/Q000097;D001793/Q000379;D003080;D004905/Q000502;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D066298;D008297;D055442;D008875;D008954;D011446;D012044;D013997;D055815	Adult;Biomarkers/blood;Blood Preservation/methods;Cold Temperature;Erythrocyte Aging/physiology;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Male;Metabolome;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;Prospective Studies;Regression Analysis;Time Factors;Young Adult	Paglia G;D'Alessandro A;Rolfsson Ó;Sigurjónsson ÓE;Bordbar A;Palsson S;Nemkov T;Hansen KC;Gudmundsson S;Palsson BO	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood-2016-06-721688		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
902	29090212	Metabolism of Citrate and Other Carboxylic Acids in Erythrocytes As a Function of Oxygen Saturation and Refrigerated Storage.	State-of-the-art proteomics technologies have recently helped to elucidate the unanticipated complexity of red blood cell metabolism. One recent example is citrate metabolism, which is catalyzed by cytosolic isoforms of Krebs cycle enzymes that are present and active in mature erythrocytes and was determined using quantitative metabolic flux analysis. In previous studies, we reported significant increases in glycolytic fluxes in red blood cells exposed to hypoxia <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i>, an observation relevant to transfusion medicine owing to the potential benefits associated with hypoxic storage of packed red blood cells. Here, using a combination of steady state and quantitative tracing metabolomics experiments with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1,2,3</sub>-glucose, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-citrate, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-glutamine, and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-aspartate <i>via</i> ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled on line with mass spectrometry, we observed that hypoxia <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> promotes consumption of citrate and other carboxylates. These metabolic reactions are theoretically explained by the activity of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase 1 and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (abundantly represented in the red blood cell proteome), though moonlighting functions of additional enzymes cannot be ruled out. These observations enhance understanding of red blood cell metabolic responses to hypoxia, which could be relevant to understand systemic physiological and pathological responses to high altitude, ischemia, hemorrhage, sepsis, pulmonary hypertension, or hemoglobinopathies. Results from this study will also inform the design and testing of novel additive solutions that optimize red blood cell storage under oxygen-controlled conditions.	eng	175		Frontiers in medicine	4		2017					Nemkov T;Sun K;Reisz JA;Yoshida T;Dunham A;Wen EY;Wen AQ;Roach RC;Hansen KC;Xia Y;D'Alessandro A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True

It is well established that as a blood unit ages, fewer of the unit's red blood cells (RBCs) remain in circulation post-transfusion. The mechanism for clearance is not well defined. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a phospholipid that is primarily found on the inner leaflet of healthy cells, and is an important ligand for phagocytosis of dead cells when exposed.	eng	136	141	Transfusion medicine (Oxford, England)	27	2	2017	Apr		D001793;D055252/Q000378;D016922;D004910/Q000378;D005260;D005434/Q000379;D006801;D008297;D010714/Q000378;D013997	Blood Preservation;Cell-Derived Microparticles/metabolism;Cellular Senescence;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Female;Flow Cytometry/methods;Humans;Male;Phosphatidylethanolamines/metabolism;Time Factors	Larson MC;Karafin MS;Hillery CA;Hogg N	Journal, Articles					10.1111/tme.12382		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
904	28495915	Extracellular glycine is necessary for optimal hemoglobinization of erythroid cells.	Vertebrate heme synthesis requires three substrates: succinyl-CoA, which regenerates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, iron and glycine. For each heme molecule synthesized, one atom of iron and eight molecules of glycine are needed. Inadequate delivery of iron to immature erythroid cells leads to a decreased production of heme, but virtually nothing is known about the consequence of an insufficient supply of extracellular glycine on the process of hemoglobinization. To address this issue, we exploited mice in which the gene encoding glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) was disrupted. Primary erythroid cells isolated from fetal livers of GlyT1 knockout (GlyT1<sup>-/-</sup>) and GlyT1-haplodeficient (GlyT1<sup>+/-</sup>) embryos had decreased cellular uptake of [2<sup>-14</sup>C]glycine and heme synthesis as revealed by a considerable decrease in [2-<sup>14</sup>C]glycine and <sup>59</sup>Fe incorporation into heme. Since GlyT1<sup>-/-</sup> mice die during the first postnatal day, we analyzed blood parameters of newborn pups and found that GlyT1<sup>-/-</sup> animals develop hypochromic microcytic anemia. Our finding that Glyt1-deficiency causes decreased heme synthesis in erythroblasts is unexpected, since glycine is a non-essential amino acid. It also suggests that GlyT1 represents a limiting step in heme and, consequently, hemoglobin production.	eng	1314	1323	Haematologica	102	8	2017	Aug		D000818;D041905/Q000378;D005998/Q000378;D050487/Q000172;D050487/Q000235;D006418/Q000096;D006454/Q000096;D006454/Q000378;D051379;D018345	Animals;Erythroid Cells/metabolism;Glycine/metabolism;Glycine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/deficiency;Glycine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics;Heme/biosynthesis;Hemoglobins/biosynthesis;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Mice;Mice, Knockout	Garcia-Santos D;Schranzhofer M;Bergeron R;Sheftel AD;Ponka P	Journal, Articles					10.3324/haematol.2016.155671		Erythro;erythro	True
905	28689405	Quantitative Analysis of Human Red Blood Cell Proteome.	"Red blood cells (RBCs) are the most abundant cell type in the human body. RBCs and, in particular, their plasma membrane composition have been extensively studied for many years. During the past decade proteomics studies have extended our knowledge on RBC composition; however, these studies did not provide quantitative insights. Here we report a large-scale proteomics investigation of RBCs and their ""white ghost"" membrane fraction. Samples were processed using the multienzyme digestion filter-aided sample preparation (MED-FASP) and analyzed using Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. Protein abundances were computed using the total protein approach (TPA). The validation of the data with stable isotope-labeled peptide-based protein quantification followed. Our in-depth analysis resulted in the identification of 2650 proteins, of which 1890 occurred at more than 100 copies per cell. We quantified 41 membrane transporter proteins spanning an abundance range of five orders of magnitude. Some of these, including the drug transporter ABCA7 and choline transporters SLC44A1 and SLC44A2, have not previously been identified in RBC membranes. Comparison of protein copy numbers assessed by proteomics showed a good correlation with literature data; however, abundances of several proteins were not consistent with the classical references. Because we validated our findings by a targeted analysis using labeled standards, our data suggest that some older reference data from a variety of biochemical approaches are inaccurate. Our study provides the first ""in-depth"" quantitative analysis of the RBC proteome and will promote future studies of erythrocyte structure, functions, and disease."	eng	2752	2761	Journal of proteome research	16	8	2017	Aug	04	D018528/Q000032;D015703/Q000032;D004912/Q000737;D006801;D008562/Q000032;D026901/Q000032;D027701/Q000032;D020543/Q000032;D040901/Q000379	ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis;Antigens, CD/analysis;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Humans;Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis;Membrane Transport Proteins/analysis;Organic Cation Transport Proteins/analysis;Proteome/analysis;Proteomics/methods	Bryk AH;Wiśniewski JR	Journal, Articles					10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00025		Red Blood Cell;Erythrocyte;Red blood cell;erythrocyte;RBC	True
906	29051181	Disorders of erythrocyte hydration.	The erythrocyte contains a network of pathways that regulate salt and water content in the face of extracellular and intracellular osmotic perturbations. This allows the erythrocyte to maintain a narrow range of cell hemoglobin concentration, a process critical for normal red blood cell function and survival. Primary disorders that perturb volume homeostasis jeopardize the erythrocyte and may lead to its premature destruction. These disorders are marked by clinical, laboratory, and physiologic heterogeneity. Recent studies have revealed that these disorders are also marked by genetic heterogeneity. They have implicated roles for several proteins, PIEZO1, a mammalian mechanosensory protein; GLUT1, the glucose transporter; SLC4A1, the anion transporter; RhAG, the Rh-associated glycoprotein; KCNN4, the Gardos channel; and ABCB6, an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette family member, in the maintenance of erythrocyte volume homeostasis. Secondary disorders of erythrocyte hydration include sickle cell disease, thalassemia, hemoglobin CC, and hereditary spherocytosis, where cellular dehydration may be a significant contributor to disease pathology and clinical complications. Understanding the pathways regulating erythrocyte water and solute content may reveal innovative strategies to maintain normal volume in disorders associated with primary or secondary cellular dehydration. These mechanisms will serve as a paradigm for other cells and may reveal new therapeutic targets for disease prevention and treatment beyond the erythrocyte.	eng	2699	2708	Blood	130	25	2017	Dec	21	D000818;D003681;D004911/Q000502;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000502;D006706;D006801	Animals;Dehydration;Erythrocyte Volume/physiology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/physiology;Homeostasis;Humans	Gallagher PG	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood-2017-04-590810		Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True

908	29296771	Red blood cells in hemorrhagic shock: a critical role for glutaminolysis in fueling alanine transamination in rats.	Red blood cells (RBCs) are the most abundant host cell in the human body and play a critical role in oxygen transport and systemic metabolic homeostasis. Hypoxic metabolic reprogramming of RBCs in response to high-altitude hypoxia or anaerobic storage in the blood bank has been extensively described. However, little is known about the RBC metabolism following hemorrhagic shock (HS), the most common preventable cause of death in trauma, the global leading cause of total life-years lost. Metabolomics analyses were performed through ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry on RBCs from Sprague-Dawley rats undergoing HS (mean arterial pressure [MAP], <30 mm Hg) in comparison with sham rats (MAP, >80 mm Hg). Steady-state measurements were accompanied by metabolic flux analysis upon tracing of in vivo-injected <sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N-glutamine or inhibition of glutaminolysis using the anticancer drug CB-839. RBC metabolic phenotypes recapitulated the systemic metabolic reprogramming observed in plasma from the same rodent model. Results indicate that shock RBCs rely on glutamine to fuel glutathione (GSH) synthesis and pyruvate transamination, whereas abrogation of glutaminolysis conferred early mortality and exacerbated lactic acidosis and systemic accumulation of succinate, a predictor of mortality in the military and civilian critically ill populations. Glutamine is here identified as an essential amine group donor in HS RBCs, plasma, liver, and lungs, providing additional rationale for the central role glutaminolysis plays in metabolic reprogramming and survival following severe hemorrhage.	eng	1296	1305	Blood advances	1	17	2017	Jul	25			Reisz JA;Slaughter AL;Culp-Hill R;Moore EE;Silliman CC;Fragoso M;Peltz ED;Hansen KC;Banerjee A;D'Alessandro A	Journal, Articles					10.1182/bloodadvances.2017007187		RBC;Red blood cell	True

910	28364583	Creatine kinase in human erythrocytes: A genetic anomaly reveals presence of soluble brain-type isoform.	For maintaining energy homeostasis, creatine kinase (CK) is present at elevated levels in tissues with high and/or fluctuating energy requirements such as muscle, brain, and epithelia, while there is very few CK, if any, in peripheral blood cells. However, an ectopic expression of brain-type creatine kinase (BCK) has been reported for platelets and leukocytes in an autosomal dominant inherited anomaly named CKBE. Here we investigated CK in erythrocytes of CKBE individuals from eight unrelated families. The data revealed a varying but significant increase of CK activity in CKBE individuals as compared to controls, reaching an almost 800-fold increase in two CKBE individuals which also had increased erythrocyte creatine. Immunoblotting with highly specific antibodies confirmed that the expressed CK isoform is BCK. Cell fractionation evidenced soluble BCK, suggesting cytosolic and not membrane localization of erythrocyte CK as reported earlier. These results are discussed in the context of putative CK energy buffering and transfer functions in red blood cells.	eng	33	37	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	64		2017	May		D052276/Q000235;D052276/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D005799;D006801;D007527/Q000235;D007527/Q000378;D008297	Creatine Kinase, BB Form/genetics;Creatine Kinase, BB Form/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Genes, Dominant;Humans;Isoenzymes/genetics;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Male	Kay L;Tokarska-Schlattner M;Quenot-Carrias B;Goudet B;Bugert P;Arnold H;Scheuerbrandt G;Schlattner U	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bcmd.2017.03.008		Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
911	28496185	'Gardos Channelopathy': a variant of hereditary Stomatocytosis with complex molecular regulation.	The Gardos channel is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive, K<sup>+</sup> selective channel present in several tissues including RBCs, where it is involved in cell volume regulation. Recently, mutations at two different aminoacid residues in KCNN4 have been reported in patients with hereditary xerocytosis. We identified by whole exome sequencing a new family with two members affected by chronic hemolytic anemia carrying mutation R352H in the KCNN4 gene. No additional mutations in genes encoding for RBCs cytoskeletal, membrane or channel proteins were detected. We performed functional studies on patients' RBCs to evaluate the effects of R352H mutation on the cellular properties and eventually on the clinical phenotype. Gardos channel hyperactivation was demonstrated in circulating erythrocytes and erythroblasts differentiated ex-vivo from peripheral CD34+ cells. Pathological alterations in the function of multiple ion transport systems were observed, suggesting the presence of compensatory effects ultimately preventing cellular dehydration in patient's RBCs; moreover, flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence live-cell imaging showed Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload in the RBCs of both patients and hypersensitivity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by RBCs to swelling. Altogether these findings suggest that the 'Gardos channelopathy' is a complex pathology, to some extent different from the common hereditary xerocytosis.	eng	1744		Scientific reports	7	1	2017	May	11	D000255/Q000378;D000293;D000328;D000745/Q000235;D020013;D053447/Q000235;D002648;D004912/Q000378;D015672/Q000378;D005190;D005260;D006019;D006801;D015160/Q000235;D007223;D040582/Q000235;D051660/Q000235;D008297;D008954;D009154/Q000235;D010375;D012964/Q000378	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Adolescent;Adult;Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital/genetics;Calcium Signaling;Channelopathies/genetics;Child;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism;Family;Female;Glycolysis;Humans;Hydrops Fetalis/genetics;Infant;Inheritance Patterns/genetics;Intermediate-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels/genetics;Male;Models, Biological;Mutation/genetics;Pedigree;Sodium/metabolism	Fermo E;Bogdanova A;Petkova-Kirova P;Zaninoni A;Marcello AP;Makhro A;Hänggi P;Hertz L;Danielczok J;Vercellati C;Mirra N;Zanella A;Cortelezzi A;Barcellini W;Kaestner L;Bianchi P	Journal, Articles							Erythro;Erythrocyte;erythro;erythrocyte;RBC	True
912	28484010	Erythritol is a pentose-phosphate pathway metabolite and associated with adiposity gain in young adults.	Metabolomic markers associated with incident central adiposity gain were investigated in young adults. In a 9-mo prospective study of university freshmen (<i>n</i> = 264). Blood samples and anthropometry measurements were collected in the first 3 d on campus and at the end of the year. Plasma from individuals was pooled by phenotype [incident central adiposity, stable adiposity, baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 5.05%, HbA1c < 4.92%] and assayed using GC-MS, chromatograms were analyzed using MetaboliteDetector software, and normalized metabolite levels were compared using Welch's <i>t</i> test. Assays were repeated using freshly prepared pools, and statistically significant metabolites were quantified in a targeted GC-MS approach. Isotope tracer studies were performed to determine if the potential marker was an endogenous human metabolite in men and in whole blood. Participants with incident central adiposity gain had statistically significantly higher blood erythritol [<i>P</i> < 0.001, false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.0435], and the targeted assay revealed 15-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): 13.27, 16.25] higher blood erythritol compared with participants with stable adiposity. Participants with baseline HbA1c > 5.05% had 21-fold (95% CI: 19.84, 21.41) higher blood erythritol compared with participants with lower HbA1c (<i>P</i> < 0.001, FDR = 0.00016). Erythritol was shown to be synthesized endogenously from glucose via the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP) in stable isotope-assisted ex vivo blood incubation experiments and through in vivo conversion of erythritol to erythronate in stable isotope-assisted dried blood spot experiments. Therefore, endogenous production of erythritol from glucose may contribute to the association between erythritol and obesity observed in young adults.	eng	E4233	E4240	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	114	21	2017	May	23	D050154/Q000502;D000293;D000328;D004896/Q000097;D004896/Q000378;D005260;D008401;D005947/Q000378;D006442/Q000378;D006801;D008297;D055432;D009765/Q000473;D010427/Q000502;D011446;D013334;D014495;D015430/Q000502;D055815	Adiposity/physiology;Adolescent;Adult;Erythritol/blood;Erythritol/metabolism;Female;Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry;Glucose/metabolism;Glycated Hemoglobin/metabolism;Humans;Male;Metabolomics;Obesity/pathology;Pentose Phosphate Pathway/physiology;Prospective Studies;Students;Universities;Weight Gain/physiology;Young Adult	Hootman KC;Trezzi JP;Kraemer L;Burwell LS;Dong X;Guertin KA;Jaeger C;Stover PJ;Hiller K;Cassano PA	Journal, Articles					10.1073/pnas.1620079114		erythro	True
913	28348082	Urate hydroperoxide oxidizes human peroxiredoxin 1 and peroxiredoxin 2.	Urate hydroperoxide is a product of the oxidation of uric acid by inflammatory heme peroxidases. The formation of urate hydroperoxide might be a key event in vascular inflammation, where there is large amount of uric acid and inflammatory peroxidases. Urate hydroperoxide oxidizes glutathione and sulfur-containing amino acids and is expected to react fast toward reactive thiols from peroxiredoxins (Prxs). The kinetics for the oxidation of the cytosolic 2-Cys Prx1 and Prx2 revealed that urate hydroperoxide oxidizes these enzymes at rates comparable with hydrogen peroxide. The second-order rate constants of these reactions were 4.9 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 2.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for Prx1 and Prx2, respectively. Kinetic and simulation data suggest that the oxidation of Prx2 by urate hydroperoxide occurs by a three-step mechanism, where the peroxide reversibly associates with the enzyme; then it oxidizes the peroxidatic cysteine, and finally, the rate-limiting disulfide bond is formed. Of relevance, the disulfide bond formation was much slower in Prx2 (<i>k</i><sub>3</sub> = 0.31 s<sup>-1</sup>) than Prx1 (<i>k</i><sub>3</sub> = 14.9 s<sup>-1</sup>). In addition, Prx2 was more sensitive than Prx1 to hyperoxidation caused by both urate hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Urate hydroperoxide oxidized Prx2 from intact erythrocytes to the same extent as hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, Prx1 and Prx2 are likely targets of urate hydroperoxide in cells. Oxidation of Prxs by urate hydroperoxide might affect cell function and be partially responsible for the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects of uric acid.	eng	8705	8715	The Journal of biological chemistry	292	21	2017	May	26	D004220/Q000737;D004220/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D007700;D010084;D010545/Q000737;D010545/Q000378;D054464/Q000737;D054464/Q000378;D014527/Q000031;D014527/Q000737;D014527/Q000378	Disulfides/chemistry;Disulfides/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Kinetics;Oxidation-Reduction;Peroxides/chemistry;Peroxides/metabolism;Peroxiredoxins/chemistry;Peroxiredoxins/metabolism;Uric Acid/analogs & derivatives;Uric Acid/chemistry;Uric Acid/metabolism	Carvalho LAC;Truzzi DR;Fallani TS;Alves SV;Toledo JC;Augusto O;Netto LES;Meotti FC	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M116.767657		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

915	29146974	Human Cyclophilin B forms part of a multi-protein complex during erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum.	Invasion of human erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites involves multiple interactions between host receptors and their merozoite ligands. Here we report human Cyclophilin B as a receptor for PfRhopH3 during merozoite invasion. Localization and binding studies show that Cyclophilin B is present on the erythrocytes and binds strongly to merozoites. We demonstrate that PfRhopH3 binds to the RBCs and their treatment with Cyclosporin A prevents merozoite invasion. We also show a multi-protein complex involving Cyclophilin B and Basigin, as well as PfRhopH3 and PfRh5 that aids the invasion. Furthermore, we report identification of a de novo peptide CDP3 that binds Cyclophilin B and blocks invasion by up to 80%. Collectively, our data provide evidence of compounded interactions between host receptors and merozoite surface proteins and paves the way for developing peptide and small-molecules that inhibit the protein-protein interactions, individually or in toto, leading to abrogation of the invasion process.	eng	1548		Nature communications	8	1	2017	Nov	16	D000818;D051926/Q000378;D002352/Q000378;D021983/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000469;D005260;D006790;D006801;D052940/Q000378;D052940/Q000502;D008807;D010963/Q000378;D010963/Q000502;D011485;D015800/Q000378;D011817	Animals;Basigin/metabolism;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cyclophilins/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Female;Host-Parasite Interactions;Humans;Merozoites/metabolism;Merozoites/physiology;Mice, Inbred BALB C;Plasmodium falciparum/metabolism;Plasmodium falciparum/physiology;Protein Binding;Protozoan Proteins/metabolism;Rabbits	Prakash P;Zeeshan M;Saini E;Muneer A;Khurana S;Kumar Chourasia B;Deshmukh A;Kaur I;Dabral S;Singh N;Anam Z;Chaurasiya A;Kaushik S;Dahiya P;Kalamuddin M;Kumar Thakur J;Mohmmed A;Ranganathan A;Malhotra P	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
916	28434171	Peroxidatic cysteine residue of peroxiredoxin 2 separated from human red blood cells treated by tert-butyl hydroperoxide is hyperoxidized into sulfinic and sulfonic acids.	Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is a redox enzyme that is abundantly expressed in red blood cells (RBCs) and has been the focus of clinical attention for monitoring the oxidative status. We previously developed a method to quantify the reduced and hyperoxidized forms of Prx2 in human RBCs using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the present study, we investigated the hyperoxidative status of Prx2 at the molecular level in a post-translational modification analysis using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system. The LC-MS/MS analysis of the trypsin digests of Prx2 fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC demonstrated that the cysteine-51 residue (Cys-51) of the protein was modified with the hyperoxidative functional groups, sulfinic acid (-SO<sub>2</sub>H) and sulfonic acid (-SO<sub>3</sub>H), in RBCs treated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP). Furthermore, a selected ion monitoring (SIM) analysis quantitatively showed that sulfinic acid- and sulfonic acid-induced modifications in Prx2 Cys-51 were increased by the treatment with the oxidant. It was demonstrated that the peroxidatic cysteine of Prx2 separated using our HPLC system for oxidative monitoring was hyperoxidized into sulfinic acid and sulfonic acid in RBCs under an oxidative stress condition.	eng	279	289	Human cell	30	4	2017	Oct		D000328;D002478;D002851;D003545/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D013058;D010084;D018384;D054464/Q000378;D013441/Q000378;D013451/Q000378;D055815;D020122/Q000494	Adult;Cells, Cultured;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cysteine/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Mass Spectrometry;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Peroxiredoxins/metabolism;Sulfinic Acids/metabolism;Sulfonic Acids/metabolism;Young Adult;tert-Butylhydroperoxide/pharmacology	Ishida YI;Aki M;Fujiwara S;Nagahama M;Ogasawara Y	Journal, Articles					10.1007/s13577-017-0171-0		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True

918	29057326	Accelerating metabolism and transmembrane cation flux by distorting red blood cells.	Under static conditions, mammalian red blood cells (RBCs) require a continuous supply of energy, typically via glucose, to maintain their biconcave disc shape. Mechanical distortion, in a complementary way, should lead to increased energy demand that is manifest in accelerated glycolysis. The experimental challenge in observing this phenomenon was met by reversibly and reproducibly distorting the cells and noninvasively measuring glycolytic flux. This was done with a gel-distorting device that was coupled with <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We measured [3-<sup>13</sup>C]l-lactate production from [1,6-<sup>13</sup>C]d-glucose in the RBCs suspended in gelatin gels, and up to 90% rate enhancements were recorded. Thus, for the first time, we present experiments that demonstrate the linkage of mechanical distortion to metabolic changes in whole mammalian cells. In seeking a mechanism for the linkage between shape and energy supply, we measured transmembrane cation flux with Cs<sup>+</sup> (as a K<sup>+</sup> congener) using <sup>133</sup>Cs NMR spectroscopy, and the cation flux was increased up to fivefold. The postulated mechanism for these notable (in terms of whole-body energy consumption) responses is stimulation of Ca-adenosine triphosphatase by increased transmembrane flux of Ca<sup>2+</sup> via the channel protein Piezo1 and increased glycolysis because its flux is adenosine triphosphate demand-regulated.	eng	eaao1016		Science advances	3	10	2017	Oct		D001692;D002412/Q000378;D048430;D004734;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D006019;D006801;D019344/Q000096;D009682;D040542;D008954	Biological Transport;Cations/metabolism;Cell Shape;Energy Metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Glycolysis;Humans;Lactic Acid/biosynthesis;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Mechanotransduction, Cellular;Models, Biological	Kuchel PW;Shishmarev D	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
919	29045386	Mfsd2b is essential for the sphingosine-1-phosphate export in erythrocytes and platelets.	Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a potent signalling lipid secreted by red blood cells and platelets, plays numerous biologically significant roles. However, the identity of its long-sought exporter is enigmatic. Here we show that the major facilitator superfamily transporter 2b (Mfsd2b), an orphan transporter, is essential for S1P export from red blood cells and platelets. Comprehensive lipidomic analysis indicates a dramatic and specific accumulation of S1P species in Mfsd2b knockout red blood cells and platelets compared with that of wild-type controls. Consistently, biochemical assays from knockout red blood cells, platelets, and cell lines overexpressing human and mouse Mfsd2b proteins demonstrate that Mfsd2b actively exports S1P. Plasma S1P level in knockout mice is significantly reduced by 42-54% of that of wild-type level, indicating that Mfsd2b pathway contributes approximately half of the plasma S1P pool. The reduction of plasma S1P in knockout mice is insufficient to cause blood vessel leakiness, but it does render the mice more sensitive to anaphylactic shock. Stress-induced erythropoiesis significantly increased plasma S1P levels and knockout mice were sensitive to these treatments. Surprisingly, knockout mice exhibited haemolysis associated with red blood cell stomatocytes, and the haemolytic phenotype was severely increased with signs of membrane fragility under stress erythropoiesis. We show that S1P secretion by Mfsd2b is critical for red blood cell morphology. Our data reveal an unexpected physiological role of red blood cells in sphingolipid metabolism in circulation. These findings open new avenues for investigating the signalling roles of S1P derived from red blood cells and platelets.	eng	524	528	Nature	550	7677	2017	Oct	26	D000740/Q000235;D000740/Q000378;D000818;D001692;D001792/Q000378;D048430;D004906;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D017353;D057809;D006801;D008246/Q000097;D008246/Q000378;D008565/Q000172;D008565/Q000235;D008565/Q000378;D051379;D008810;D018345;D015398;D013110/Q000031;D013110/Q000097;D013110/Q000378	Anemia/genetics;Anemia/metabolism;Animals;Biological Transport;Blood Platelets/metabolism;Cell Shape;Erythrocyte Count;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Gene Deletion;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Lysophospholipids/blood;Lysophospholipids/metabolism;Membrane Proteins/deficiency;Membrane Proteins/genetics;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Signal Transduction;Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives;Sphingosine/blood;Sphingosine/metabolism	Vu TM;Ishizu AN;Foo JC;Toh XR;Zhang F;Whee DM;Torta F;Cazenave-Gassiot A;Matsumura T;Kim S;Toh SES;Suda T;Silver DL;Wenk MR;Nguyen LN	Journal, Articles					10.1038/nature24053		Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte;erythro	True
920	28409866	P. falciparum RH5-Basigin interaction induces changes in the cytoskeleton of the host RBC.	The successful invasion of Plasmodium is an essential step in their life cycle. The parasite reticulocyte-binding protein homologues (RHs) and erythrocyte-binding like proteins are two families involved in the invasion leading to merozoite-red blood cell (RBC) junction formation. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been shown to play a critical role in the invasion. RHs have been linked to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which triggers the erythrocyte-binding like proteins release ahead of junction formation, consistent with RHs performing an initial sensing function in identifying suitable RBCs. RH5, the only essential RHs, is a highly promising vaccine candidate. RH5-basigin interaction is essential for merozoite invasion and also important in determining host tropism. Here, we show that RH5 has a distinct function from the other RHs. We show that RH5-Basigin interaction on its own triggers a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in the RBC resulting in changes in RBC cytoskeletal proteins phosphorylation and overall alterations in RBC cytoskeleton architecture. Antibodies targeting RH5 that block the signal prevent invasion before junction formation consistent with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in the RBC leading to rearrangement of the cytoskeleton required for invasion. This work provides the first time a functional context for the essential role of RH5 and will now open up new avenues to target merozoite invasion.	eng			Cellular microbiology	19	9	2017	Sep		D000911/Q000276;D000953/Q000096;D051926/Q000378;D020013/Q000502;D002352/Q000037;D002352/Q000276;D002352/Q000378;D002460;D003599/Q000469;D003599/Q000473;D004912/Q000469;D004912/Q000502;D006790/Q000502;D006801;D016778/Q000469;D052940/Q000472;D010963/Q000378;D010963/Q000472;D015800/Q000096	Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology;Antigens, Protozoan/biosynthesis;Basigin/metabolism;Calcium Signaling/physiology;Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors;Carrier Proteins/immunology;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cell Line;Cytoskeleton/parasitology;Cytoskeleton/pathology;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Erythrocytes/physiology;Host-Parasite Interactions/physiology;Humans;Malaria, Falciparum/parasitology;Merozoites/pathogenicity;Plasmodium falciparum/metabolism;Plasmodium falciparum/pathogenicity;Protozoan Proteins/biosynthesis	Aniweh Y;Gao X;Hao P;Meng W;Lai SK;Gunalan K;Chu TT;Sinha A;Lescar J;Chandramohanadas R;Li HY;Sze SK;Preiser PR	Journal, Articles					10.1111/cmi.12747		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True

922	29329318	Erythrocyte Inosine triphosphatase activity: A potential biomarker for adverse events during combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV.	The purine analogues tenofovir and abacavir are precursors of potential substrates for the enzyme Inosine 5'-triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPase). Here, we investigated the association of ITPase activity and ITPA genotype with the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) during combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In 393 adult HIV-seropositive patients, AEs were defined as events that led to stop of cART regimen. ITPase activity ≥4 mmol IMP/mmol Hb/hour was considered as normal. ITPA genotype was determined by testing two ITPA polymorphisms: c.94C>A (p.Pro32Thr, rs1127354) and c.124+21A>C (rs7270101). Logistic regression analysis determined odds ratios for developing AEs. In tenofovir-containing regimens decreased ITPase activity was associated with less AEs (p = 0.01) and longer regimen duration (p = 0.001). In contrast, in abacavir-containing regimens decreased ITPase activity was associated with more AEs (crude p = 0.02) and increased switching of medication due to AEs (p = 0.03). ITPA genotype wt/wt was significantly associated with an increase in the occurrence of AEs in tenofovir-containing regimens. Decreased ITPase activity seems to be protective against occurrence of AEs in tenofovir-containing cART, while it is associated with an increase in AEs in abacavir-containing regimens.	eng	e0191069		PloS one	13	1	2018			D000328;D000368;D000369;D019380/Q000008;D019380/Q000627;D015415/Q000097;D004359;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D015658/Q000188;D006801;D008297;D008875;D011755/Q000097;D055815;D000097630	Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Anti-HIV Agents/administration & dosage;Anti-HIV Agents/therapeutic use;Biomarkers/blood;Drug Therapy, Combination;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;HIV Infections/drug therapy;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Pyrophosphatases/blood;Young Adult;Inosine Triphosphatase	Peltenburg NC;Bierau J;Bakker JA;Schippers JA;Lowe SH;Paulussen ADC;van den Bosch BJC;Leers MPG;Hansen BE;Verbon A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte	True
923	30588511	Glyoxalase activity in human erythrocytes and mouse lymphoma, liver and brain probed with hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C-methylglyoxal.	Methylglyoxal is a faulty metabolite. It is a ubiquitous by-product of glucose and amino acid metabolism that spontaneously reacts with proximal amino groups in proteins and nucleic acids, leading to impairment of their function. The glyoxalase pathway evolved early in phylogeny to bring about rapid catabolism of methylglyoxal, and an understanding of the role of methylglyoxal and the glyoxalases in many diseases is beginning to emerge. Metabolic processing of methylglyoxal is very rapid in vivo and thus notoriously difficult to detect and quantify. Here we show that <sup>13</sup>C nuclei in labeled methylglyoxal can be hyperpolarized using dynamic nuclear polarization, providing <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance signal enhancements in the solution state close to 5,000-fold. We demonstrate the applications of this probe of metabolism for kinetic characterization of the glyoxalase system in isolated cells as well as mouse brain, liver and lymphoma in vivo.	eng	232		Communications biology	1		2018					Shishmarev D;Kuchel PW;Pagès G;Wright AJ;Hesketh RL;Kreis F;Brindle KM	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True
924	29024896	Identification of a soluble guanylate cyclase in RBCs: preserved activity in patients with coronary artery disease.	Endothelial dysfunction is associated with decreased NO bioavailability and impaired activation of the NO receptor soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in the vasculature and in platelets. Red blood cells (RBCs) are known to produce NO under hypoxic and normoxic conditions; however evidence of expression and/or activity of sGC and downstream signaling pathway including phopshodiesterase (PDE)-5 and protein kinase G (PKG) in RBCs is still controversial. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether RBCs carry a functional sGC signaling pathway and to address whether this pathway is compromised in coronary artery disease (CAD). Using two independent chromatographic procedures, we here demonstrate that human and murine RBCs carry a catalytically active α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>1</sub>-sGC (isoform 1), which converts <sup>32</sup>P-GTP into <sup>32</sup>P-cGMP, as well as PDE5 and PKG. Specific sGC stimulation by NO+BAY 41-2272 increases intracellular cGMP-levels up to 1000-fold with concomitant activation of the canonical PKG/VASP-signaling pathway. This response to NO is blunted in α1-sGC knockout (KO) RBCs, but fully preserved in α2-sGC KO. In patients with stable CAD and endothelial dysfunction red cell eNOS expression is decreased as compared to aged-matched controls; by contrast, red cell sGC expression/activity and responsiveness to NO are fully preserved, although sGC oxidation is increased in both groups. Collectively, our data demonstrate that an intact sGC/PDE5/PKG-dependent signaling pathway exists in RBCs, which remains fully responsive to NO and sGC stimulators/activators in patients with endothelial dysfunction. Targeting this pathway may be helpful in diseases with NO deficiency in the microcirculation like sickle cell anemia, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure.	eng	328	337	Redox biology	14		2018	Apr		D000328;D000368;D000818;D003324/Q000378;D006152/Q000378;D017869/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D051379;D008875;D009569/Q000378;D015398;D000071756/Q000032;D000071756/Q000378	Adult;Aged;Animals;Coronary Artery Disease/metabolism;Cyclic GMP/metabolism;Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Mice;Middle Aged;Nitric Oxide/metabolism;Signal Transduction;Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase/analysis;Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase/metabolism	Cortese-Krott MM;Mergia E;Kramer CM;Lückstädt W;Yang J;Wolff G;Panknin C;Bracht T;Sitek B;Pernow J;Stasch JP;Feelisch M;Koesling D;Kelm M	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.redox.2017.08.020		RBC;Erythrocyte;red cell;Red blood cell	True
925	29662110	Identification of human glycosyltransferase genes expressed in erythroid cells predicts potential carbohydrate blood group loci.	Glycans are biologically important structures synthesised by glycosyltransferase (GT) enzymes. Disruptive genetic null variants in GT genes can lead to serious illness but benign phenotypes are also seen, including antigenic differences on the red blood cell (RBC) surface, giving rise to blood groups. To characterise known and potential carbohydrate blood group antigens without a known underlying gene, we searched public databases for human GT loci and investigated their variation in the 1000 Genomes Project (1000 G). We found 244 GT genes, distributed over 44 families. All but four GT genes had missense variants or other variants predicted to alter the amino acid sequence, and 149 GT genes (61%) had variants expected to cause null alleles, often associated with antigen-negative blood group phenotypes. In RNA-Seq data generated from erythroid cells, 155 GT genes were expressed at a transcript level comparable to, or higher than, known carbohydrate blood group loci. Filtering for GT genes predicted to cause a benign phenotype, a set of 30 genes remained, 16 of which had variants in 1000 G expected to result in null alleles. Our results identify potential blood group loci and could serve as a basis for characterisation of the genetic background underlying carbohydrate RBC antigens.	eng	6040		Scientific reports	8	1	2018	Apr	16	D000017/Q000235;D000483;D002241/Q000235;D041905/Q000378;D056426;D014644;D016695/Q000235;D006801;D020125;D010641	ABO Blood-Group System/genetics;Alleles;Carbohydrates/genetics;Erythroid Cells/metabolism;Genetic Loci;Genetic Variation;Glycosyltransferases/genetics;Humans;Mutation, Missense;Phenotype	Jöud M;Möller M;Olsson ML	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythro;red blood cell;erythro	True
926	29244191	The role of OAT2 (SLC22A7) in the cyclic nucleotide biokinetics of human erythrocytes.	The present study was conducted to characterise the transporter(s) responsible for the uptake of cyclic nucleotides to human erythrocytes. Western blotting showed that hRBC expressed OAT2 (SLC22A7), but detection of OAT1 (SLC22A6), or OAT3 (SLC22A8) was not possible. Intact hRBC were employed to clarify the simultaneous cyclic nucleotide egression and uptake. Both these opposing processes were studied. The K<sub>m</sub> -values for high affinity efflux was 3.5 ± 0.1 and 39.4 ± 5.7 μM for cGMP and cAMP, respectively. The respective values for low affinity efflux were 212 ± 11 and 339 ± 42 μM. The uptake was characterised with apparently low affinity and similar K<sub>m</sub> -values for cGMP (2.2 mM) and cAMP (0.89 mM). Using an iterative approach in order to balance uptake with efflux, the predicted real K<sub>m</sub> -values for uptake were 100-200 μM for cGMP and 50-150 μM for cAMP. The established OAT2-substrate indomethacin showed a competitive interaction with cyclic nucleotide uptake. Creatinine, also an OAT2 substrate, showed saturable uptake with a K<sub>m</sub> of 854 ± 98 μM. Unexpectedly, co-incubation with cyclic nucleotides showed an uncompetitive inhibition. The observed K<sub>m</sub> -values were 399 ± 44 and 259 ± 30 μM for creatinine, in the presence of cGMP and cAMP, respectively. Finally, the OAT1-substrate para-aminohippurate (PAH) showed some uptake (K<sub>m</sub> -value of 2.0 ± 0.4 mM) but did not interact with cyclic nucleotide or indomethacin transport.	eng	5972	5980	Journal of cellular physiology	233	8	2018	Aug		D001692/Q000502;D000242/Q000378;D006152/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D009711/Q000378;D029362/Q000378	Biological Transport/physiology;Cyclic AMP/metabolism;Cyclic GMP/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Nucleotides/metabolism;Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent/metabolism	Sager G;Smaglyukova N;Fuskevaag OM	Journal, Articles					10.1002/jcp.26409		RBC;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
927	30239107	Novel de novo pathogenic variant in the ODC1 gene in a girl with developmental delay, alopecia, and dysmorphic features.	The ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) gene plays an important role in physiological and cell developmental processes including embryogenesis, organogenesis, and neoplastic cell growth. Here, we report an 32-month-old Caucasian female with a heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation in the ODC1 gene that leads to a premature abrogation of 14-aa residues at the ODC protein c-terminus. This is the first human case confirming similar symptoms observed in a transgenic ODC1 mouse model first described over 20 years ago. Phenotypic manifestations include macrosomia, macrocephaly, developmental delay, alopecia, spasticity, hypotonia, cutaneous vascular malformation, delayed visual maturation, and sensorineural hearing loss. We here describe for the first time a new pediatric disorder that is directly linked to a de novo pathogenic variant in the ODC1 gene. The ODC1 gene mutation (c.1342 A>T) was identified by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Red blood cells obtained from our patient showed elevated ODC protein and polyamine levels compared to healthy controls. Our autosomal dominant patient who carries this gain-of-function ODC1 mutation may benefit from treatment with α-difluoromethylornithine, a well-tolerated, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA-approved drug.	eng	2548	2553	American journal of medical genetics.

928	30312994	Methylation of protein aspartates and deamidated asparagines as a function of blood bank storage and oxidative stress in human red blood cells.	Being devoid of de novo protein synthesis capacity, red blood cells (RBCs) have evolved to recycle oxidatively damaged proteins via mechanisms that involve methylation of dehydrated and deamidated aspartate and asparagine residues.

929	30878032	Alternate and Additional Functions of Erythrocyte Hemoglobin.	The review discusses pleiotropic effects of erythrocytic hemoglobin (Hb) and their significance for human health. Hemoglobin is mostly known as an oxygen carrier, but its biochemical functions are not limited to this. The following aspects of Hb functioning are examined: (i) catalytic functions of the heme component (nitrite reductase, NO dioxygenase, monooxygenase, alkylhydroperoxidase) and of the apoprotein (esterase, lipoxygenase); (ii) participation in nitric oxide metabolism; (iii) formation of membrane-bound Hb and its role in the regulation of erythrocyte metabolism; (iv) physiological functions of Hb catabolic products (iron, CO, bilirubin, peptides). Special attention is given to Hb participation in signal transduction in erythrocytes. The relationships between various erythrocyte metabolic parameters, such as oxygen status, ATP formation, pH regulation, redox balance, and state of the cytoskeleton are discussed with regard to Hb. Hb polyfunctionality can be considered as a manifestation of the principle of biochemical economy.	eng	1575	1593	Biochemistry.

930	29079593	Hypoxia modulates the purine salvage pathway and decreases red blood cell and supernatant levels of hypoxanthine during refrigerated storage.	Hypoxanthine catabolism <i>in vivo</i> is potentially dangerous as it fuels production of urate and, most importantly, hydrogen peroxide. However, it is unclear whether accumulation of intracellular and supernatant hypoxanthine in stored red blood cell units is clinically relevant for transfused recipients. Leukoreduced red blood cells from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-normal or -deficient human volunteers were stored in AS-3 under normoxic, hyperoxic, or hypoxic conditions (with oxygen saturation ranging from <3% to >95%). Red blood cells from healthy human volunteers were also collected at sea level or after 1-7 days at high altitude (>5000 m). Finally, C57BL/6J mouse red blood cells were incubated <i>in vitro</i> with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>1</sub>-aspartate or <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-adenosine under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, with or without deoxycoformycin, a purine deaminase inhibitor. Metabolomics analyses were performed on human and mouse red blood cells stored for up to 42 or 14 days, respectively, and correlated with 24 h post-transfusion red blood cell recovery. Hypoxanthine increased in stored red blood cell units as a function of oxygen levels. Stored red blood cells from human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient donors had higher levels of deaminated purines. Hypoxia <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> decreased purine oxidation and enhanced purine salvage reactions in human and mouse red blood cells, which was partly explained by decreased adenosine monophosphate deaminase activity. In addition, hypoxanthine levels negatively correlated with post-transfusion red blood cell recovery in mice and - preliminarily albeit significantly - in humans. In conclusion, hypoxanthine is an <i>in vitro</i> metabolic marker of the red blood cell storage lesion that negatively correlates with post-transfusion recovery <i>in vivo</i> Storage-dependent hypoxanthine accumulation is ameliorated by hypoxia-induced decreases in purine deamination reaction rates.	eng	361	372	Haematologica	103	2	2018	Feb		D000818;D001793/Q000379;D003641;D017707;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D019271/Q000097;D000860;D051379;D008810;D011687/Q000378	Animals;Blood Preservation/methods;Deamination;Erythrocyte Transfusion;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hypoxanthine/blood;Hypoxia;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Purines/metabolism	Nemkov T;Sun K;Reisz JA;Song A;Yoshida T;Dunham A;Wither MJ;Francis RO;Roach RC;Dzieciatkowska M;Rogers SC;Doctor A;Kriebardis A;Antonelou M;Papassideri I;Young CT;Thomas TA;Hansen KC;Spitalnik SL;Xia Y;Zimring JC;Hod EA;D'Alessandro A	Journal, Articles					10.3324/haematol.2017.178608		Erythrocyte;red blood cell;Red blood cell	True
931	29275011	Red blood cells: The primary reservoir of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in whole blood.	Red blood cells are widely accepted to be inert carriers of oxygen and haemoglobin, but there is growing evidence that they play a much more critical role in immune function. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a key cytokine in disease with additional oxido-reductase activity, which aids in managing oxidative stress. Although two studies have reported the presence of MIF in red blood cells, no study has quantified the levels of this protein. In this study, freshly isolated plasma, platelets, leukocytes, and red blood cells from healthy individuals were collected and the concentration of MIF was determined using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. This analysis demonstrated that MIF in red blood cells was present at 25 µg per millilitre of whole blood, which is greater than99% of the total MIF and 1000-fold higher concentration than plasma. This result was supported by electrophoresis and Western blot analysis, which identified MIF in its monomer structural form following sample processing. Furthermore, by assessing the level of tautomerase activity in red blood cell fractions in the presence of a MIF inhibitor, it was determined that the red blood cell-derived MIF was also functionally active. Together, these findings have implications on the effect of haemolysis during sample preparation and provide some clue into the inflammatory processes that occur following haemolysis in vivo. These results support the hypothesis that red blood cells are a major reservoir of this inflammatory protein and may play a role in inflammation.	eng	34	40	Cytokine	102		2018	Feb		D000328;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D019746/Q000032;D019746/Q000097;D019746/Q000276;D007962/Q000378;D008263/Q000032;D008263/Q000097;D008263/Q000276;D008297;D008875	Adult;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/analysis;Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/blood;Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/immunology;Leukocytes/metabolism;Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/analysis;Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/blood;Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/immunology;Male;Middle Aged	Karsten E;Hill CJ;Herbert BR	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.cyto.2017.12.005		Erythrocyte;red blood cell;Red blood cell	True
932	29066600	Evidence That Differences in Fructosamine-3-Kinase Activity May Be Associated With the Glycation Gap in Human Diabetes.	The phenomenon of a discrepancy between glycated hemoglobin levels and other indicators of average glycemia may be due to many factors but can be measured as the glycation gap (GGap). This GGap is associated with differences in complications in patients with diabetes and may possibly be explained by dissimilarities in deglycation in turn leading to altered production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). We hypothesized that variations in the level of the deglycating enzyme fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) might be associated with the GGap. We measured erythrocyte FN3K concentrations and enzyme activity in a population dichotomized for a large positive or negative GGap. FN3K protein was higher and we found a striking threefold greater activity (323%) at any given FN3K protein level in the erythrocytes of the negative-GGap group compared with the positive-GGap group. This was associated with lower AGE levels in the negative-GGap group (79%), lower proinflammatory adipokines (leptin-to-adiponectin ratio) (73%), and much lower prothrombotic PAI-1 levels (19%). We conclude that FN3K may play a key role in the GGap and thus diabetes complications such that FN3K may be a potential predictor of the risk of diabetes complications. Pharmacological modifications of its activity may provide a novel approach to their prevention.	eng	131	136	Diabetes	67	1	2018	Jan		D054392/Q000378;D052242/Q000378;D000368;D000369;D001786/Q000378;D003920/Q000378;D005260;D006442/Q000378;D017127;D006031;D006801;D020738/Q000378;D008297;D008875;D010766;D017853/Q000235;D017853/Q000378;D017395/Q000378	Adipokines/metabolism;Adiponectin/metabolism;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Blood Glucose/metabolism;Diabetes Mellitus/metabolism;Female;Glycated Hemoglobin/metabolism;Glycation End Products, Advanced;Glycosylation;Humans;Leptin/metabolism;Male;Middle Aged;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism;Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/metabolism	Dunmore SJ;Al-Derawi AS;Nayak AU;Narshi A;Nevill AM;Hellwig A;Majebi A;Kirkham P;Brown JE;Singh BM	Journal, Articles					10.2337/db17-0441		erythrocyte	True
933	29976888	Indoxyl Sulfate, a Uremic Toxin, Stimulates Reactive Oxygen Species Production and Erythrocyte Cell Death Supposedly by an Organic Anion Transporter 2 (OAT2) and NADPH Oxidase Activity-Dependent Pathways.	It is hypothesized that the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS) plays a role in the pathogenesis of renal anemia. To further explore that hypothesis, we examined the effects of IS on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), and erythrocyte death (eryptosis) in red blood cells (RBC) from healthy controls (CON-RBC) and hemodialyzed patients (HD-RBC), respectively. RBC were incubated either in either TRIS-Glc-BSA buffer or IS at concentrations of 0.01, 0.09, and 0.17 mM, respectively. We measured ROS generation (expressed as % of DCFH-DA positive RBC), eryptosis (expressed as % of annexin-V positive RBC), and GSH levels after 6, 12, and 24 h. When incubated in buffer, ROS production was approximately seven-fold higher at all time points HD-RBC when compared to CON-RBC. Incubation with IS increased ROS production in CON-RBS dose-dependently up to 10-fold. Eryptosis in buffer-incubated HD-RBC was up to seven-fold higher as compared to COB-RBC. Incubation of CON-RBC with IS increased the eryptosis rate dose-dependently up to 6-fold. Pretreatment of CON-RBC with the organic anion transporter 2 (OAT2) specific inhibitor ketoprofen or with NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium-Cl blunted the IS effect on both ROS production and eryptosis induction. While GSH levels in HD-RBC were reduced when compared to CON-RBC, they were not affected by IS incubation. In summary, IS increases ROS generation and eryptosis in CON-RBC by an activity dependent of the IS influx through OAT2, and NADPH oxidase activity-dependent, and a GSH-independent mechanism. These findings lend support to a putative role of IS in the pathogenesis of renal anemia.	eng			Toxins	10	7	2018	Jul	05	D000328;D000072817/Q000187;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D007200/Q000633;D008297;D019255/Q000378;D029362/Q000378;D017382/Q000378;D006435;D015398;D014118/Q000633;D014511;D055815	Adult;Eryptosis/drug effects;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Humans;Indican/toxicity;Male;NADPH Oxidases/metabolism;Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent/metabolism;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism;Renal Dialysis;Signal Transduction;Toxins, Biological/toxicity;Uremia;Young Adult	Dias GF;Bonan NB;Steiner TM;Tozoni SS;Rodrigues S;Nakao LS;Kuntsevich V;Pecoits Filho R;Kotanko P;Moreno-Amaral AN	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
934	30061676	Human erythrocytes release ATP by a novel pathway involving VDAC oligomerization independent of pannexin-1.	We previously demonstrated that the translocase protein TSPO2 together with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) were involved in a membrane transport complex in human red blood cells (RBCs). Because VDAC was proposed as a channel mediating ATP release in RBCs, we used TSPO ligands together with VDAC and ANT inhibitors to test this hypothesis. ATP release was activated by TSPO ligands, and blocked by inhibitors of VDAC and ANT, while it was insensitive to pannexin-1 blockers. TSPO ligand increased extracellular ATP (ATPe) concentration by 24-59% over the basal values, displaying an acute increase in [ATPe] to a maximal value, which remained constant thereafter. ATPe kinetics were compatible with VDAC mediating a fast but transient ATP efflux. ATP release was strongly inhibited by PKC and PKA inhibitors as well as by depleting intracellular cAMP or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting a mechanism involving protein kinases. TSPO ligands favoured VDAC polymerization yielding significantly higher densities of oligomeric bands than in unstimulated cells. Polymerization was partially inhibited by decreasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP contents. The present results show that TSPO ligands induce polymerization of VDAC, coupled to activation of ATP release by a supramolecular complex involving VDAC, TSPO2 and ANT.	eng	11384		Scientific reports	8	1	2018	Jul	30	D033741/Q000378;D000255/Q000378;D002118/Q000378;D017630/Q000378;D017868/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008024;D008954;D009419/Q000378;D058105;D011493/Q000378;D055503;D018079/Q000378;D050994/Q000378	Adenine Nucleotide Translocator 1/metabolism;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Calcium/metabolism;Connexins/metabolism;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Ligands;Models, Biological;Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism;Polymerization;Protein Kinase C/metabolism;Protein Multimerization;Receptors, GABA/metabolism;Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels/metabolism	Marginedas-Freixa I;Alvarez CL;Moras M;Leal Denis MF;Hattab C;Halle F;Bihel F;Mouro-Chanteloup I;Lefevre SD;Le Van Kim C;Schwarzbaum PJ;Ostuni MA	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
935	29599206	Impact of hydroxycarbamide and interferon-α on red cell adhesion and membrane protein expression in polycythemia vera.	Polycythemia vera is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the JAK2V617F mutation, elevated blood cell counts and a high risk of thrombosis. Although the red cell lineage is primarily affected by JAK2V617F, the impact of mutated JAK2 on circulating red blood cells is poorly documented. Recently, we showed that in polycythemia vera, erythrocytes had abnormal expression of several proteins including Lu/BCAM adhesion molecule and proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum, mainly calreticulin and calnexin. Here we investigated the effects of hydroxycarbamide and interferon-α treatments on the expression of erythroid membrane proteins in a cohort of 53 patients. Surprisingly, while both drugs tended to normalize calreticulin expression, proteomics analysis showed that hydroxycarbamide deregulated the expression of 53 proteins in red cell ghosts, with overexpression and downregulation of 37 and 16 proteins, respectively. Within over-expressed proteins, hydroxycarbamide was found to enhance the expression of adhesion molecules such as Lu/BCAM and CD147, while interferon-α did not. In addition, we found that hydroxycarbamide increased Lu/BCAM phosphorylation and exacerbated red cell adhesion to its ligand laminin. Our study reveals unexpected adverse effects of hydroxycarbamide on red cell physiology in polycythemia vera and provides new insights into the effects of this molecule on gene regulation and protein recycling or maturation during erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, our study shows deregulation of Lu/BCAM and CD147 that are two ubiquitously expressed proteins linked to progression of solid tumors, paving the way for future studies to address the role of hydroxycarbamide in tissues other than blood cells in myeloproliferative neoplasms.	eng	972	981	Haematologica	103	6	2018	Jun		D000483;D015415;D002448/Q000187;D002448/Q000235;D015815/Q000235;D015815/Q000378;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000473;D005260;D005786/Q000187;D006801;D006918/Q000494;D053614/Q000235;D008297;D008565/Q000235;D008565/Q000378;D008875;D009154;D011087/Q000097;D011087/Q000175;D011087/Q000235	Alleles;Biomarkers;Cell Adhesion/drug effects;Cell Adhesion/genetics;Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics;Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/pathology;Female;Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects;Humans;Hydroxyurea/pharmacology;Janus Kinase 2/genetics;Male;Membrane Proteins/genetics;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Middle Aged;Mutation;Polycythemia Vera/blood;Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis;Polycythemia Vera/genetics	Brusson M;De Grandis M;Cochet S;Bigot S;Marin M;Leduc M;Guillonneau F;Mayeux P;Peyrard T;Chomienne C;Le Van Kim C;Cassinat B;Kiladjian JJ;El Nemer W	Journal, Articles					10.3324/haematol.2017.182303		Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;erythrocyte;red cell	True
936	29712634	Enhanced phosphocholine metabolism is essential for terminal erythropoiesis.	Red cells contain a unique constellation of membrane lipids. Although much is known about regulated protein expression, the regulation of lipid metabolism during erythropoiesis is poorly studied. Here, we show that transcription of PHOSPHO1, a phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine phosphatase that mediates the hydrolysis of phosphocholine to choline, is strongly upregulated during the terminal stages of erythropoiesis of both human and mouse erythropoiesis, concomitant with increased catabolism of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphocholine as shown by global lipidomic analyses of mouse and human terminal erythropoiesis. Depletion of PHOSPHO1 impaired differentiation of fetal mouse and human erythroblasts, and, in adult mice, depletion impaired phenylhydrazine-induced stress erythropoiesis. Loss of PHOSPHO1 also impaired phosphocholine catabolism in mouse fetal liver progenitors and resulted in accumulation of several lipids; adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production was reduced as a result of decreased oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis replaced oxidative phosphorylation in PHOSPHO1-knockout erythroblasts and the increased glycolysis was used for the production of serine or glycine. Our study elucidates the dynamic changes in lipid metabolism during terminal erythropoiesis and reveals the key roles of PC and phosphocholine metabolism in energy balance and amino acid supply.	eng	2955	2966	Blood	131	26	2018	Jun	28	D000255/Q000378;D000818;D002478;D004900/Q000166;D004900/Q000378;D004920;D017353;D006019;D006801;D051379;D008810;D018345;D010085;D010744/Q000235;D010744/Q000378;D010767/Q000378	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Animals;Cells, Cultured;Erythroblasts/cytology;Erythroblasts/metabolism;Erythropoiesis;Gene Deletion;Glycolysis;Humans;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Oxidative Phosphorylation;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism;Phosphorylcholine/metabolism	Huang NJ;Lin YC;Lin CY;Pishesha N;Lewis CA;Freinkman E;Farquharson C;Millán JL;Lodish H	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood-2018-03-838516		Erythro;Red cell;erythro	True
937	29315908	Sub-minute kinetics of human red cell fumarase: <sup>1</sup> H spin-echo NMR spectroscopy and <sup>13</sup> C rapid-dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization.	Fumarate is an important probe of metabolism in hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. It is used to detect the release of fumarase in cancer tissues, which is associated with necrosis and drug treatment. Nevertheless, there are limited reports describing the detailed kinetic studies of this enzyme in various cells and tissues. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the sub-minute kinetics of human red blood cell fumarase using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and to provide a quantitative description of the enzyme that is relevant to the use of fumarate as a probe of cell rupture. The fumarase reaction was studied using time courses of <sup>1</sup> H spin-echo and <sup>13</sup> C-NMR spectra. <sup>1</sup> H-NMR experiments showed that the fumarase reaction in hemolysates is sufficiently rapid to make its kinetics amenable to study in a period of approximately 3 min, a timescale characteristic of hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup> C-NMR spectroscopy. The rapid-dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (RD-DNP) technique was used to hyperpolarize [1,4-<sup>13</sup> C]fumarate, which was injected into concentrated hemolysates. The kinetic data were analyzed using recently developed FmR<sub>α</sub> analysis and modeling of the enzymatic reaction using Michaelis-Menten equations. In RD-DNP experiments, the decline in the <sup>13</sup> C-NMR signal from fumarate, and the concurrent rise and fall of that from malate, were captured with high spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, which allowed the robust quantification of fumarase kinetics. The kinetic parameters obtained indicate the potential contribution of hemolysis to the overall rate of the fumarase reaction when <sup>13</sup> C-NMR RD-DNP is used to detect necrosis in animal models of implanted tumors. The analytical procedures developed will be applicable to studies of other rapid enzymatic reactions using conventional and hyperpolarized substrate NMR spectroscopy.	eng			NMR in biomedicine	31	3	2018	Mar		D066241;D004912/Q000201;D005649/Q000378;D005650/Q000737;D005650/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008293/Q000737;D008293/Q000378;D008390;D008954;D009010;D066244;D013997	Carbon-13 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Fumarate Hydratase/metabolism;Fumarates/chemistry;Fumarates/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Malates/chemistry;Malates/metabolism;Markov Chains;Models, Biological;Monte Carlo Method;Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Time Factors	Shishmarev D;Wright AJ;Rodrigues TB;Pileio G;Stevanato G;Brindle KM;Kuchel PW	Journal, Articles					10.1002/nbm.3870		Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
938	29409925	Investigations on the role of hemoglobin in sulfide metabolism by intact human red blood cells.	"In addition to their role as oxygen transporters, red blood cells (RBCs) contribute to cardiovascular homeostasis by regulating nitric oxide (NO) metabolism via interaction of hemoglobin (Hb) with nitrite and NO itself. RBCs were proposed to also participate in sulfide metabolism. Although Hb is known to react with sulfide, sulfide metabolism by intact RBCs has not been characterized so far. Therefore we explored the role of Hb in sulfide metabolism in intact human RBCs. We find that upon exposure of washed RBCs to sulfide, no changes in oxy/deoxyhemoglobin (oxy/deoxyHb) are observed by UV-vis and EPR spectroscopy. However, sulfide reacts with methemoglobin (metHb), forming a methemoglobin-sulfide (metHb-SH) complex. Moreover, while metHb-SH is stable in cell-free systems even in the presence of biologically relevant thiols, it gradually decomposes to produce oxyHb, inorganic polysulfides and thiosulfate in intact cells, as detected by EPR and mass spectrometry. Taken together, our results demonstrate that under physiological conditions RBCs are able to metabolize sulfide via intermediate formation of a metHb-SH complex, which subsequently decomposes to oxyHb. We speculate that decomposition of metHb-SH is preceded by an inner-sphere electron transfer, forming reduced Hb (which binds oxygen to form oxyHb) and thiyl radical (a process we here define as ""reductive sulfhydration""), which upon release, gives rise to the oxidized products, thiosulfate and polysulfides. Thus, not only is metHb an efficient scavenger and regulator of sulfide in blood, intracellular sulfide itself may play a role in keeping Hb in the reduced oxygen-binding form and, therefore, be involved in RBC physiology and function."	eng	163	173	Biochemical pharmacology	149		2018	Mar		D002478;D004912/Q000378;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D006862/Q000378;D008706/Q000378;D013885/Q000378	Cells, Cultured;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen Sulfide/metabolism;Methemoglobin/metabolism;Thiosulfates/metabolism	Bianco CL;Savitsky A;Feelisch M;Cortese-Krott MM	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bcp.2018.01.045		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
939	29599243	Erythrocytic ferroportin reduces intracellular iron accumulation, hemolysis, and malaria risk.	Malaria parasites invade red blood cells (RBCs), consume copious amounts of hemoglobin, and severely disrupt iron regulation in humans. Anemia often accompanies malaria disease; however, iron supplementation therapy inexplicably exacerbates malarial infections. Here we found that the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) was highly abundant in RBCs, and iron supplementation suppressed its activity. Conditional deletion of the <i>Fpn</i> gene in erythroid cells resulted in accumulation of excess intracellular iron, cellular damage, hemolysis, and increased fatality in malaria-infected mice. In humans, a prevalent <i>FPN</i> mutation, Q248H (glutamine to histidine at position 248), prevented hepcidin-induced degradation of FPN and protected against severe malaria disease. <i>FPN</i> Q248H appears to have been positively selected in African populations in response to the impact of malaria disease. Thus, FPN protects RBCs against oxidative stress and malaria infection.	eng	1520	1523	Science (New York, N.Y.)	359	6383	2018	Mar	30	D019943;D000740/Q000378;D000818;D044383/Q000235;D027682/Q000235;D027682/Q000378;D002648;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005260;D006461;D064451/Q000378;D064451/Q000494;D006801;D007501/Q000008;D007501/Q000378;D007501/Q000494;D008288/Q000097;D008288/Q000453;D008288/Q000235;D008297;D051379;D018345;D009154;D018384;D012306;D012641;D017384;D015024/Q000453	Amino Acid Substitution;Anemia/metabolism;Animals;Black People/genetics;Cation Transport Proteins/genetics;Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism;Child;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Female;Hemolysis;Hepcidins/metabolism;Hepcidins/pharmacology;Humans;Iron/administration & dosage;Iron/metabolism;Iron/pharmacology;Malaria/blood;Malaria/epidemiology;Malaria/genetics;Male;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Mutation;Oxidative Stress;Risk;Selection, Genetic;Sequence Deletion;Zambia/epidemiology	Zhang DL;Wu J;Shah BN;Greutélaers KC;Ghosh MC;Ollivierre H;Su XZ;Thuma PE;Bedu-Addo G;Mockenhaupt FP;Gordeuk VR;Rouault TA	Journal, Articles					10.1126/science.aal2022		Erythro;Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;RBC	True
940	29304480	Mapping the phenotypic repertoire of the cytoplasmic 2-Cys peroxiredoxin - Thioredoxin system. 1. Understanding commonalities and differences among cell types.	The system (PTTRS) formed by typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prx), thioredoxin (Trx), Trx reductase (TrxR), and sulfiredoxin (Srx) is central in antioxidant protection and redox signaling in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Understanding how the PTTRS integrates these functions requires tracing phenotypes to molecular properties, which is non-trivial. Here we analyze this problem based on a model that captures the PTTRS' conserved features. We have mapped the conditions that generate each distinct response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> supply rates (v<sub>sup</sub>), and estimated the parameters for thirteen human cell types and for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The resulting composition-to-phenotype map yielded the following experimentally testable predictions. The PTTRS permits many distinct responses including ultra-sensitivity and hysteresis. However, nearly all tumor cell lines showed a similar response characterized by limited Trx-S<sup>-</sup> depletion and a substantial but self-limited gradual accumulation of hyperoxidized Prx at high v<sub>sup</sub>. This similarity ensues from strong correlations between the TrxR, Srx and Prx activities over cell lines, which contribute to maintain the Prx-SS reduction capacity in slight excess over the maximal steady state Prx-SS production. In turn, in erythrocytes, hepatocytes and HepG2 cells high v<sub>sup</sub> depletes Trx-S<sup>-</sup> and oxidizes Prx mainly to Prx-SS. In all nucleated human cells the Prx-SS reduction capacity defined a threshold separating two different regimes. At sub-threshold v<sub>sup</sub> the cytoplasmic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration is determined by Prx, nM-range and spatially localized, whereas at supra-threshold v<sub>sup</sub> it is determined by much less active alternative sinks and μM-range throughout the cytoplasm. The yeast shows a distinct response where the Prx Tsa1 accumulates in sulfenate form at high v<sub>sup</sub>. This is mainly due to an exceptional stability of Tsa1's sulfenate. The implications of these findings for thiol redox regulation and cell physiology are discussed. All estimates were thoroughly documented and provided, together with analytical approximations for system properties, as a resource for quantitative redox biology.	eng	297	315	Redox biology	15		2018	May		D000975/Q000378;D045744;D005978/Q000235;D005978/Q000378;D056945;D006801;D010084;D018384/Q000235;D050862/Q000378;D010544/Q000235;D010544/Q000378;D054464/Q000235;D054464/Q000378;D012441/Q000235;D012441/Q000378;D029701/Q000235;D029701/Q000378;D015398;D054481/Q000378;D013879/Q000378	Antioxidants/metabolism;Cell Line, Tumor;Glutathione/genetics;Glutathione/metabolism;Hep G2 Cells;Humans;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress/genetics;Oxidoreductases Acting on Sulfur Group Donors/metabolism;Peroxidases/genetics;Peroxidases/metabolism;Peroxiredoxins/genetics;Peroxiredoxins/metabolism;Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics;Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism;Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics;Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/metabolism;Signal Transduction;Thioredoxin Reductase 1/metabolism;Thioredoxins/metabolism	Selvaggio G;Coelho PMBM;Salvador A	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.redox.2017.12.008		erythrocyte	True
941	29749379	Clinically relevant mutations in the ABCG2 transporter uncovered by genetic analysis linked to erythrocyte membrane protein expression.	The ABCG2 membrane protein is a key xeno- and endobiotic transporter, modulating the absorption and metabolism of pharmacological agents and causing multidrug resistance in cancer. ABCG2 is also involved in uric acid elimination and its impaired function is causative in gout. Analysis of ABCG2 expression in the erythrocyte membranes of healthy volunteers and gout patients showed an enrichment of lower expression levels in the patients. By genetic screening based on protein expression, we found a relatively frequent, novel ABCG2 mutation (ABCG2-M71V), which, according to cellular expression studies, causes reduced protein expression, although with preserved transporter capability. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated a stumbled dynamics of the mutant protein, while ABCG2-M71V expression in vitro could be corrected by therapeutically relevant small molecules. These results suggest that personalized medicine should consider this newly discovered ABCG2 mutation, and genetic analysis linked to protein expression provides a new tool to uncover clinically important mutations in membrane proteins.	eng	7487		Scientific reports	8	1	2018	May	10	D000070997/Q000737;D000070997/Q000235;D000070997/Q000378;D019943;D000818;D016022;D004285;D004910/Q000378;D005820;D006073/Q000097;D006073/Q000235;D057809;D006367;D006801;D033461/Q000097;D033461/Q000235;D061985;D008958;D050505/Q000235;D050505/Q000378;D009154;D009363/Q000737;D009363/Q000235;D009363/Q000378;D020641;D061987;D018411	ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2/chemistry;ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2/genetics;ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2/metabolism;Amino Acid Substitution;Animals;Case-Control Studies;Dogs;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Genetic Testing;Gout/blood;Gout/genetics;HEK293 Cells;HeLa Cells;Humans;Hyperuricemia/blood;Hyperuricemia/genetics;Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells;Models, Molecular;Mutant Proteins/genetics;Mutant Proteins/metabolism;Mutation;Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry;Neoplasm Proteins/genetics;Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Sf9 Cells;Spodoptera	Zámbó B;Bartos Z;Mózner O;Szabó E;Várady G;Poór G;Pálinkás M;Andrikovics H;Hegedűs T;Homolya L;Sarkadi B	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

943	30451920	Characterization of a new N-terminally acetylated extra-mitochondrial isoform of frataxin in human erythrocytes.	Frataxin is a highly conserved protein encoded by the frataxin (FXN) gene. The full-length 210-amino acid form of protein frataxin (1-210; isoform A) expressed in the cytosol of cells rapidly translocates to the mitochondria, where it is converted to the mature form (81-210) by mitochondrial processing peptidase. Mature frataxin (81-210) is a critically important protein because it facilitates the assembly of mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster protein complexes such as aconitase, lipoate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenases. Decreased expression of frataxin protein is responsible for the devastating rare genetic disease of Friedreich's ataxia. The mitochondrial form of frataxin has long been thought to be present in erythrocytes even though paradoxically, erythrocytes lack mitochondria. We have discovered that erythrocyte frataxin is in fact a novel isoform of frataxin (isoform E) with 135-amino acids and an N-terminally acetylated methionine residue. There is three times as much isoform E in erythrocytes (20.9 ± 6.4 ng/mL) from the whole blood of healthy volunteers (n = 10) when compared with the mature mitochondrial frataxin present in other blood cells (7.1 ± 1.0 ng/mL). Isoform E lacks a mitochondrial targeting sequence and so is distributed to both cytosol and the nucleus when expressed in cultured cells. When extra-mitochondrial frataxin isoform E is expressed in HEK 293 cells, it is converted to a shorter isoform identical to the mature frataxin found in mitochondria, which raises the possibility that it is involved in disease etiology. The ability to specifically quantify extra-mitochondrial and mitochondrial isoforms of frataxin in whole blood will make it possible to readily follow the natural history of diseases such as Friedreich's ataxia and monitor the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.	eng	17043		Scientific reports	8	1	2018	Nov	19	D000107;D000595;D004912/Q000378;D057809;D006801;D033862/Q000097;D033862/Q000737;D033862/Q000235;D008928/Q000378;D020033/Q000097;D020033/Q000737;D020033/Q000235;D012333/Q000235;D000096923	Acetylation;Amino Acid Sequence;Erythrocytes/metabolism;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Iron-Binding Proteins/blood;Iron-Binding Proteins/chemistry;Iron-Binding Proteins/genetics;Mitochondria/metabolism;Protein Isoforms/blood;Protein Isoforms/chemistry;Protein Isoforms/genetics;RNA, Messenger/genetics;Frataxin	Guo L;Wang Q;Weng L;Hauser LA;Strawser CJ;Mesaros C;Lynch DR;Blair IA	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
944	30308949	Induction of ATP Release, PPIX Transport, and Cholesterol Uptake by Human Red Blood Cells Using a New Family of TSPO Ligands.	Two main isoforms of the Translocator Protein (TSPO) have been identified. TSPO1 is ubiquitous and is mainly present at the outer mitochondrial membrane of most eukaryotic cells, whereas, TSPO2 is specific to the erythroid lineage, located at the plasma membrane, the nucleus, and the endoplasmic reticulum. The design of specific tools is necessary to determine the molecular associations and functions of TSPO, which remain controversial nowadays. We recently demonstrated that TSPO2 is involved in a supramolecular complex of the erythrocyte membrane, where micromolar doses of the classical TSPO ligands induce ATP release and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPPIX) transport. In this work, three newly-designed ligands (NCS1016, NCS1018, and NCS1026) were assessed for their ability to modulate the functions of various erythrocyte's and compare them to the TSPO classical ligands. The three new ligands were effective in reducing intraerythrocytic <i>Plasmodium</i> growth, without compromising erythrocyte survival. While NCS1016 and NCS1018 were the most effective ligands in delaying sorbitol-induced hemolysis, NCS1016 induced the highest uptake of ZnPPIX and NCS1026 was the only ligand inhibiting the cholesterol uptake. Differential effects of ligands are probably due, not only, to ligand features, but also to the dynamic interaction of TSPO with various partners at the cell membrane. Further studies are necessary to fully understand the mechanisms of the TSPO's complex activation.	eng			International journal of molecular sciences	19	10	2018	Oct	10	D000255/Q000378;D001692;D002784/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006461;D006801;D008024;D010963/Q000187;D011485;D011524/Q000378;D017382;D018079/Q000378;D013012/Q000494	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Biological Transport;Cholesterol/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemolysis;Humans;Ligands;Plasmodium falciparum/drug effects;Protein Binding;Protoporphyrins/metabolism;Reactive Oxygen Species;Receptors, GABA/metabolism;Sorbitol/pharmacology	Marginedas-Freixa I;Alvarez CL;Moras M;Hattab C;Bouyer G;Chene A;Lefevre SD;Le Van Kim C;Bihel F;Schwarzbaum PJ;Ostuni MA	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;Red Blood Cell;erythrocyte;erythro	True
945	30327373	Absolute proteome quantification of highly purified populations of circulating reticulocytes and mature erythrocytes.	Reticulocytes produced in the bone marrow undergo maturation in the bloodstream to give rise to erythrocytes. Although the proteome of circulating red cells has been the subject of several reports, the cellular populations used for these studies were never completely devoid of reticulocytes. In our current study, we used highly purified erythrocyte and reticulocyte populations to quantify the absolute expression levels of the proteins in each cell population. Erythrocytes and reticulocytes were purified in a multistep process involving cellulose chromatography, Percoll gradient centrifugation, and fluorescence cell sorting after thiazole orange labeling. Proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry from whole cells and erythrocyte plasma membrane (ghosts), leading to the identification and quantification of 2077 proteins, including 654 that were reticulocyte-specific. Absolute quantifications of these proteins were made using the mean corpuscular hemoglobin content of the cells as a standard. For each protein, we calculated the percentage loss during the terminal stages of reticulocyte maturation and the percentage of association with the plasma membrane. In addition, we used modified adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate molecules that enable the transfer of a biotin molecule to the catalytic sites of kinases to isolate active kinases in the erythrocytes and determined the absolute expression of 75 protein kinases and the modification of their expression during reticulocyte maturation. Our findings represent the first absolute quantification of proteins that are specifically expressed in normal erythrocytes with no detectable contamination by reticulocytes. Our findings thus represent a reference database for the future proteomic analysis of pathological erythrocytes.	eng	2646	2657	Blood advances	2	20	2018	Oct	23	D004912/Q000378;D006801;D020543/Q000378;D012156/Q000378	Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Proteome/metabolism;Reticulocytes/metabolism	Gautier EF;Leduc M;Cochet S;Bailly K;Lacombe C;Mohandas N;Guillonneau F;El Nemer W;Mayeux P	Journal, Articles					10.1182/bloodadvances.2018023515		red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
946	31552303	Quantitative comparative analysis of human erythrocyte surface proteins between individuals from two genetically distinct populations.	Red blood cells (RBCs) play a critical role in oxygen transport, and are the focus of important diseases including malaria and the haemoglobinopathies. Proteins at the RBC surface can determine susceptibility to disease, however previous studies classifying the RBC proteome have not used specific strategies directed at enriching cell surface proteins. Furthermore, there has been no systematic analysis of variation in abundance of RBC surface proteins between genetically disparate human populations. These questions are important to inform not only basic RBC biology but additionally to identify novel candidate receptors for malarial parasites. Here, we use 'plasma membrane profiling' and tandem mass tag-based mass spectrometry to enrich and quantify primary RBC cell surface proteins from two sets of nine donors from the UK or Senegal. We define a RBC surface proteome and identify potential <i>Plasmodium</i> receptors based on either diminished protein abundance, or increased variation in RBCs from West African individuals.	eng	350		Communications biology	2		2019			D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D008565/Q000378;D020543;D040901/Q000379;D049490/Q000379	Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Proteome;Proteomics/methods;Systems Biology/methods	Ravenhill BJ;Kanjee U;Ahouidi A;Nobre L;Williamson J;Goldberg JM;Antrobus R;Dieye T;Duraisingh MT;Weekes MP	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;Red blood cell	True
947	31709379	MEK1/2 as a Therapeutic Target in Sickle Cell Disease.	Identification of novel therapeutic targets has improved diagnostics and treatment of many diseases. Many innovative treatment strategies have been developed based on the newly identified biomarkers and key molecules. Most of the research focused on ways to manipulate signaling pathways by activating or suppressing them, validate new therapeutic targets for treatment, and epigenetic treatment of diseases. With the identification of aberrations in multiple growth pathways, the focus then shifted to the small molecules involved in these pathways for targeted therapy. In this communication/short review, we highlight the importance of identification of abnormal activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ERK1/2, and its upstream mediator MEK1/2, in erythrocytes in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) critical for the adhesive interactions of these cells with the endothelium, and leukocytes promoting circulatory obstruction leading to tissue ischemia and infraction. We also discuss how targeting this signaling cascade with MEK1/2 inhibitors can reverse acute vasoocclusive crises in SCD.	eng			International journal of blood research and disorders	6		2019					Zennadi R	Journal, Articles							erythrocyte	True

949	30898060	Casein Kinase 1 Underlies Temperature Compensation of Circadian Rhythms in Human Red Blood Cells.	Temperature compensation and period determination by casein kinase 1 (CK1) are conserved features of eukaryotic circadian rhythms, whereas the clock gene transcription factors that facilitate daily gene expression rhythms differ between phylogenetic kingdoms. Human red blood cells (RBCs) exhibit temperature-compensated circadian rhythms, which, because RBCs lack nuclei, must occur in the absence of a circadian transcription-translation feedback loop. We tested whether period determination and temperature compensation are dependent on CKs in RBCs. As with nucleated cell types, broad-spectrum kinase inhibition with staurosporine lengthened the period of the RBC clock at 37°C, with more specific inhibition of CK1 and CK2 also eliciting robust changes in circadian period. Strikingly, inhibition of CK1 abolished temperature compensation and increased the Q<sub>10</sub> for the period of oscillation in RBCs, similar to observations in nucleated cells. This indicates that CK1 activity is essential for circadian rhythms irrespective of the presence or absence of clock gene expression cycles.	eng	144	153	Journal of biological rhythms	34	2	2019	Apr		D048128/Q000037;D048128/Q000502;D057906/Q000235;D002940;D004791/Q000494;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000502;D006801;D008297;D019311/Q000494;D013696	Casein Kinase Ialpha/antagonists & inhibitors;Casein Kinase Ialpha/physiology;Circadian Clocks/genetics;Circadian Rhythm;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/physiology;Humans;Male;Staurosporine/pharmacology;Temperature	Beale AD;Kruchek E;Kitcatt SJ;Henslee EA;Parry JSW;Braun G;Jabr R;von Schantz M;O'Neill JS;Labeed FH	Journal, Articles					10.1177/0748730419836370		RBC;red blood cell;Erythrocyte;Red Blood Cell	True
950	30659792	Single-channel permeability and glycerol affinity of human aquaglyceroporin AQP3.	For its fundamental relevance, transport of water and glycerol across the erythrocyte membrane has long been investigated before and after the discovery of aquaporins (AQPs), the membrane proteins responsible for water and glycerol transport. AQP1 is abundantly expressed in the human erythrocyte for maintaining its hydrohomeostasis where AQP3 is also expressed (at a level ~30-folds lower than AQP1) facilitating glycerol transport. This research is focused on two of the remaining questions: How permeable is AQP3 to water? What is the glycerol-AQP3 affinity under near-physiological conditions? Through atomistic modelling and large-scale simulations, we found that AQP3 is two to three times more permeable to water than AQP1 and that the glycerol-AQP3 affinity is approximately 500/M. Using these computed values along with the data from the latest literature on AQP1 and on erythrocyte proteomics, we estimated the water and glycerol transport rates across the membrane of an entire erythrocyte. We used these rates to predict the time courses of erythrocyte swelling-shrinking in response to inward and outward osmotic gradients. Experimentally, we monitored the time course of human erythrocytes when subject to an osmotic or glycerol gradient with light scattering in a stopped-flow spectrometer. We observed close agreement between the experimentally measured and the computationally predicted time courses of erythrocytes, which corroborated our computational conclusions on the AQP3 water-permeability and the glycerol-AQP3 affinity.	eng	768	775	Biochimica et biophysica acta.

951	30850395	Identification and functional analyses of disease-associated P4-ATPase phospholipid flippase variants in red blood cells.	ATP-dependent phospholipid flippase activity crucial for generating lipid asymmetry was first detected in red blood cell (RBC) membranes, but the P4-ATPases responsible have not been directly determined. Using affinity-based MS, we show that ATP11C is the only abundant P4-ATPase phospholipid flippase in human RBCs, whereas ATP11C and ATP8A1 are the major P4-ATPases in mouse RBCs. We also found that ATP11A and ATP11B are present at low levels. Mutations in the gene encoding ATP11C are responsible for blood and liver disorders, but the disease mechanisms are not known. Using heterologous expression, we show that the T415N substitution in the phosphorylation motif of ATP11C, responsible for congenital hemolytic anemia, reduces ATP11C expression, increases retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, and decreases ATPase activity by 61% relative to WT ATP11C. The I355K substitution in the transmembrane domain associated with cholestasis and anemia in mice was expressed at WT levels and trafficked to the plasma membrane but was devoid of activity. We conclude that the T415N variant causes significant protein misfolding, resulting in low protein expression, cellular mislocalization, and reduced functional activity. In contrast, the I355K variant folds and traffics normally but lacks key contacts required for activity. We propose that the loss in ATP11C phospholipid flippase activity coupled with phospholipid scramblase activity results in the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of RBCs, decreasing RBC survival and resulting in anemia.	eng	6809	6821	The Journal of biological chemistry	294	17	2019	Apr	26	D000251/Q000235;D000251/Q000378;D000818;D004910/Q000201;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000201;D006801;D008565/Q000378;D051379;D049294/Q000378;D010743/Q000378;D010766;D017510	Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics;Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism;Animals;Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Humans;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Mice;Phospholipid Transfer Proteins/metabolism;Phospholipids/metabolism;Phosphorylation;Protein Folding	Liou AY;Molday LL;Wang J;Andersen JP;Molday RS	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.RA118.007270		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
952	30563844	Regulation of erythrocyte Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransport by an oxygen-switched kinase cascade.	Many erythrocyte processes and pathways, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), KCl cotransport, ATP release, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity, ankyrin-band 3 interactions, and nitric oxide (NO) release, are regulated by changes in O<sub>2</sub> pressure that occur as a red blood cell (RBC) transits between the lungs and tissues. The O<sub>2</sub> dependence of glycolysis, PPP, and ankyrin-band 3 interactions (affecting RBC rheology) are controlled by O<sub>2</sub>-dependent competition between deoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb), but not oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb), and other proteins for band 3. We undertook the present study to determine whether the O<sub>2</sub> dependence of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransport (catalyzed by Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter 1 [NKCC1]) might similarly originate from competition between deoxyHb and a protein involved in NKCC1 regulation for a common binding site on band 3. Using three transgenic mouse strains having mutated deoxyhemoglobin-binding sites on band 3, we found that docking of deoxyhemoglobin at the N terminus of band 3 displaces the protein with no lysine kinase 1 (WNK1) from its overlapping binding site on band 3. This displacement enabled WNK1 to phosphorylate oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1 (OSR1), which, in turn, phosphorylated and activated NKCC1. Under normal solution conditions, the NKCC1 activation increased RBC volume and thereby induced changes in RBC rheology. Because the deoxyhemoglobin-mediated WNK1 displacement from band 3 in this O<sub>2</sub> regulation pathway may also occur in the regulation of other O<sub>2</sub>-regulated ion transporters, we hypothesize that the NKCC1-mediated regulatory mechanism may represent a general pattern of O<sub>2</sub> modulation of ion transporters in erythrocytes.	eng	2519	2528	The Journal of biological chemistry	294	7	2019	Feb	15	D000818;D001457/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D006454/Q000378;D051379;D010766;D017346/Q000378;D064506/Q000378;D000076204/Q000378	Animals;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Mice;Phosphorylation;Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism;Solute Carrier Family 12, Member 2/metabolism;WNK Lysine-Deficient Protein Kinase 1/metabolism	Zheng S;Krump NA;McKenna MM;Li YH;Hannemann A;Garrett LJ;Gibson JS;Bodine DM;Low PS	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.RA118.006393		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
953	30974390	Evidence for three populations of the glucose transporter in the human erythrocyte membrane.	Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is one of 13 members of the human equilibrative glucose transport protein family and the only glucose transporter thought to be expressed in human erythrocyte membranes. Although GLUT1 has been shown to be anchored to adducin at the junctional spectrin-actin complex of the membrane through interactions with multiple proteins, whether other populations of GLUT1 also exist in the human erythrocyte membrane has not been examined. Because GLUT1 plays such a critical role in erythrocyte biology and since it comprises 10% of the total membrane protein, we undertook to evaluate the subpopulations of erythrocyte GLUT1 using single particle tracking. By monitoring the diffusion of individual AlexaFluor 488-labeled GLUT1 molecules on the surfaces of intact erythrocytes, we are able to identify three distinct subpopulations of GLUT1. While the mobility of the major subpopulation is similar to that of the anion transporter, band 3, both a more mobile and more anchored subpopulation also exist. From these studies, we conclude that ~65% of GLUT1 resides in similar or perhaps the same protein complex as band 3, while the remaining 1/3rd are either freely diffusing or interacting with other cytoskeletally anchored membrane protein complexes.	eng	61	66	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	77		2019	Jul		D001457/Q000378;D015415;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D005456/Q000737;D005456/Q000378;D051246/Q000235;D051246/Q000378;D051272/Q000235;D051272/Q000378;D006801;D008856;D057054;D021381;D013194	Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Biomarkers;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry;Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism;Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative/genetics;Glucose Transport Proteins, Facilitative/metabolism;Glucose Transporter Type 1/genetics;Glucose Transporter Type 1/metabolism;Humans;Microscopy, Fluorescence;Molecular Imaging;Protein Transport;Staining and Labeling	Kodippili GC;Putt KS;Low PS	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bcmd.2019.03.005		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
954	31266243	Selective Transport of Protein-Bound Uremic Toxins in Erythrocytes.	To better understand the kinetics of protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs) during hemodialysis (HD), we investigated the distribution of hippuric acid (HA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and <i>p</i>-cresyl sulfate (<i>p</i>CS) in erythrocytes of HD patients. Their transport across the erythrocyte membrane was explored in the absence of plasma proteins in vitro in a series of loading and unloading experiments of erythrocytes from healthy subjects and HD patients, respectively. Furthermore, the impact of three inhibitors of active transport proteins in erythrocytes was studied. The four PBUTs accumulated in erythrocytes from HD patients. From loading and unloading experiments, it was found that (i) the rate of transport was dependent on the studied PBUT and increased in the following sequence: HA < IS < <i>p</i>CS < IAA and (ii) the solute partition of intra- to extra-cellular concentrations was uneven at equilibrium. Finally, inhibiting especially Band 3 proteins affected the transport of HA (both in loading and unloading), and of IS and <i>p</i>CS (loading). By exploring erythrocyte transmembrane transport of PBUTs, their kinetics can be better understood, and new strategies to improve their dialytic removal can be developed.	eng			Toxins	11	7	2019	Jul	01	D001692;D003408/Q000097;D004912/Q000378;D006626/Q000097;D006801;D007200/Q000097;D007210/Q000097;D011485;D006435;D051436/Q000097;D051436/Q000628;D013463/Q000097;D014511	Biological Transport;Cresols/blood;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hippurates/blood;Humans;Indican/blood;Indoleacetic Acids/blood;Protein Binding;Renal Dialysis;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/blood;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/therapy;Sulfuric Acid Esters/blood;Uremia	Deltombe O;Glorieux G;Marzouki S;Masereeuw R;Schneditz D;Eloot S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
955	31249027	Biochemical features of primary cells from a pediatric patient with a gain-of-function <i>ODC1</i> genetic mutation.	We recently described a new autosomal dominant genetic disorder in a pediatric patient caused by a heterozygous <i>de novo</i> mutation in the ornithine decarboxylase 1 (<i>ODC1</i>) gene. The new genetic disorder is characterized by global developmental delay, alopecia, overgrowth, and dysmorphic features. We hypothesized that this new mutation (c.1342 A>T) leads to a C-terminal truncation variant of the ODC protein that is resistant to normal proteasomal degradation, leading to putrescine accumulation in cells. ODC (E.C. 4.1.1.17) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) that plays a crucial role during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and tumorigenesis. In this study, we show that primary dermal fibroblasts derived from a skin biopsy of a 3-year-old patient contain large amounts of ODC protein and putrescine compared with primary dermal (neonatal and adult) fibroblast control cells. Importantly, the accumulated ODC protein variant remained functionally active as we detected exceptionally high ODC enzyme activity in both primary dermal fibroblasts (12-17-fold of controls) and red blood cells (RBCs) (125-137-fold of controls), using a specific <sup>14</sup>C radioactive ODC activity assay. Exposure of primary dermal fibroblasts to ODC inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) reduced the ODC activity and putrescine to levels observed in controls without adversely affecting cell morphology or inducing cell death. In conclusion, our patient and potentially other patients that carry a similar <i>ODC1</i> gain-of-function mutation might benefit from treatment with DFMO, a drug with a good safety profile, to suppress the exceptionally high ODC activity and putrescine levels in the body.	eng	2047	2057	The Biochemical journal	476	14	2019	Jul	24	D000505/Q000235;D000505/Q000378;D001706;D002478;D002675;D020405/Q000378;D020405/Q000473;D002658/Q000235;D002658/Q000378;D002658/Q000473;D029382/Q000235;D029382/Q000378;D000518/Q000494;D005260;D005347/Q000378;D005347/Q000473;D000073659;D006801;D033681/Q000235;D033681/Q000378;D011700/Q000378	Alopecia/genetics;Alopecia/metabolism;Biopsy;Cells, Cultured;Child, Preschool;Dermis/metabolism;Dermis/pathology;Developmental Disabilities/genetics;Developmental Disabilities/metabolism;Developmental Disabilities/pathology;Dicarboxylic Acid Transporters/genetics;Dicarboxylic Acid Transporters/metabolism;Eflornithine/pharmacology;Female;Fibroblasts/metabolism;Fibroblasts/pathology;Gain of Function Mutation;Humans;Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics;Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism;Putrescine/metabolism	Schultz CR;Bupp CP;Rajasekaran S;Bachmann AS	Journal, Articles					10.1042/BCJ20190294		RBC;red blood cell	True
956	30309849	Finely-tuned regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase is crucial for human adult erythropoiesis.	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric complex containing α, β, and γ subunits involved in maintaining integrity and survival of murine red blood cells. Indeed, <i>Ampk</i> α<i>1<sup>-/-</sup></i> , <i>Ampk β1<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Ampk γ1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice develop hemolytic anemia and the plasma membrane of their red blood cells shows elasticity defects. The membrane composition evolves continuously along erythropoiesis and during red blood cell maturation; defects due to the absence of Ampk could be initiated during erythropoiesis. We, therefore, studied the role of AMPK during human erythropoiesis. Our data show that AMPK activation had two distinct phases in primary erythroblasts. The phosphorylation of AMPK (Thr172) and its target acetyl CoA carboxylase (Ser79) was elevated in immature erythroblasts (glycophorin A<sup>low</sup>), then decreased conjointly with erythroid differentiation. In erythroblasts, knockdown of the α1 catalytic subunit by short hairpin RNA led to a decrease in cell proliferation and alterations in the expression of membrane proteins (band 3 and glycophorin A) associated with an increase in phosphorylation of adducin (Ser726). AMPK activation in mature erythroblasts (glycophorin A<sup>high</sup>), achieved through the use of direct activators (GSK621 and compound 991), induced cell cycle arrest in the S phase, the induction of autophagy and caspase-dependent apoptosis, whereas no such effects were observed in similarly treated immature erythroblasts. Thus, our work suggests that AMPK activation during the final stages of erythropoiesis is deleterious. As the use of direct AMPK activators is being considered as a treatment in several pathologies (diabetes, acute myeloid leukemia), this observation is pivotal. Our data highlighted the importance of the finely-tuned regulation of AMPK during human erythropoiesis.	eng	907	918	Haematologica	104	5	2019	May		D055372/Q000037;D055372/Q000235;D055372/Q000378;D000328;D000818;D017209;D001343;D002454;D002478;D004789;D004900/Q000166;D004900/Q000378;D004920;D015971;D006801;D051379;D018345;D010766;D034741/Q000235	AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors;AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics;AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism;Adult;Animals;Apoptosis;Autophagy;Cell Differentiation;Cells, Cultured;Enzyme Activation;Erythroblasts/cytology;Erythroblasts/metabolism;Erythropoiesis;Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic;Humans;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Phosphorylation;RNA, Small Interfering/genetics	Ladli M;Richard C;Aguilar LC;Ducamp S;Bondu S;Sujobert P;Tamburini J;Lacombe C;Azar N;Foretz M;Zermati Y;Mayeux P;Viollet B;Verdier F	Journal, Articles					10.3324/haematol.2018.191403		Erythro;red blood cell;erythro	True

958	30451390	Red Blood cell IMPDH activity in adults and children with or without azathioprine: Relationship between thiopurine metabolites, ITPA and TPMT activities.	Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is considered as the limiting enzyme of thiopurine metabolism for the formation of 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN). No data are available on the influence of RBC IMPDH activity on the metabolism of thiopurine drugs in individuals with IBD. The aims of this study were as follows: (a) to carry out a phenotypic study of RBC IMPDH activity in adults and children treated or not with azathioprine (AZA) for autoimmune diseases, and (b) to investigate the relationship between the activities of IMPDH, thiopurine metabolites, inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) and thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). IMPDH activity was determined in 97 adults and 67 children treated or not with AZA. 6-Thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN), 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotide (6-MeMPN) levels, and ITPA as well as TPMT activities were measured in RBCs by HPLC. Using the Gaussian mixture model, distribution of IMPDH activity was evaluated. Influence of age, sex and AZA treatment on IMPDH activity was also assessed. A bimodal distribution in IMPDH activity was found with 87% of patients exhibiting normal activity and 13% of patients with high activity. No influence of age, sex and AZA therapy was found. There is no relationship between TPMT, ITPA and IMPDH activities. A negative correlation between IMPDH activity and 6-MeMPN was shown in adults and children (rs = -0.335 P = 0.014 and rs = -0.383 P = 0.012, respectively). Our results suggest that AZA-treated patients exhibiting lower IMPDH activity could have higher Me-6MPN levels with higher risk of hepatotoxicity. We demonstrated that RBC matrix could be an interesting alternative to lymphocyte matrix to monitor thiopurine metabolites and enzyme activity.	eng	600	606	Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology	124	5	2019	May		D000293;D000328;D000367;D000368;D000369;D001327/Q000097;D001327/Q000188;D001327/Q000201;D001379/Q000009;D001379/Q000627;D002648;D002675;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007168/Q000097;D008297;D008780/Q000097;D008875;D011755/Q000097;D012189	Adolescent;Adult;Age Factors;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Autoimmune Diseases/blood;Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy;Autoimmune Diseases/enzymology;Azathioprine/adverse effects;Azathioprine/therapeutic use;Child;Child, Preschool;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/enzymology;Female;Humans;IMP Dehydrogenase/blood;Male;Methyltransferases/blood;Middle Aged;Pyrophosphatases/blood;Retrospective Studies	Citterio-Quentin A;El Mahmoudi A;Perret T;Conway A;Ryan A;Beringer A;Lachaux A;Boulieu R	Journal, Articles					10.1111/bcpt.13176		Red Blood cell;RBC;Erythrocyte	True
959	31782268	Maximal exercise and erythrocyte epoxy fatty acids: a lipidomics study.	Fatty acid (FA)-derived lipid products generated by cytochrome P450 (CYP), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cyclo-oxygenase (COX) influence cardiovascular function. However, plasma measurements invariably ignore 40% of the blood specimen, namely the erythrocytes. These red blood cells (RBCs) represent a cell mass of about 3 kg. RBCs are a potential reservoir for epoxy fatty acids, which on release could regulate vascular capacity. We tested the hypothesis that maximal physical activity would influence the epoxy fatty acid status in RBCs. We used a standardized maximal treadmill exercise according to Bruce to ensure a robust hemodynamic and metabolic response. Central hemodynamic monitoring was performed using blood pressure and heart rate measurements and maximal workload was assessed in metabolic equivalents (METs). We used tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to measure epoxides derived from CYP monooxygenase, as well as metabolites derived from LOX, COX, and CYP hydroxylase pathways. Venous blood was obtained for RBC lipidomics. With the incremental exercise test, increases in the levels of various CYP epoxy-mediators in RBCs, including epoxyoctadecenoic acids (9,10-EpOME, 12,13-EpOME), epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (5,6-EET, 11,12-EET, 14,15-EET), and epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (16,17-EDP, 19,20-EDP) occurred, as heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and plasma lactate concentrations increased. Maximal (13.5 METs) exercise intensity had no effect on diols and various LOX, COX, and hydroxylase mediators. Our findings suggest that CYP epoxy-metabolites could contribute to the cardiovascular response to maximal exercise.	eng	e14275		Physiological reports	7	22	2019	Nov		D000328;D004852/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D015444/Q000502;D005080/Q000379;D005227/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D000081362/Q000379;D008297;D008875;D055815	Adult;Epoxy Compounds/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Exercise/physiology;Exercise Test/methods;Fatty Acids/metabolism;Female;Humans;Lipidomics/methods;Male;Middle Aged;Young Adult	Gollasch B;Wu G;Dogan I;Rothe M;Gollasch M;Luft FC	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
960	31511322	Unexpected roles for ADH1 and SORD in catalyzing the final step of erythritol biosynthesis.	The low-calorie sweetener erythritol is endogenously produced from glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway in humans. Erythritol is of medical interest because elevated plasma levels of this polyol are predictive for visceral adiposity gain and development of type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms behind these associations remain unknown because the erythritol biosynthesis pathway, particularly the enzyme catalyzing the final step of erythritol synthesis (reduction of erythrose to erythritol), is not characterized. In this study, we purified two enzymes from rabbit liver capable of catalyzing the conversion of erythrose to erythritol: alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD). Both recombinant human ADH1 and SORD reduce erythrose to erythritol, using NADPH as a co-factor, and cell culture studies indicate that this activity is primarily NADPH-dependent. We found that <i>ADH1</i> variants vary markedly in both their affinity for erythrose and their catalytic capacity (turnover number). Interestingly, the recombinant protein produced from the <i>ADH1B2</i> variant, common in Asian populations, is not active when NADPH is used as a co-factor <i>in vitro</i> We also confirmed SORD contributes to intracellular erythritol production in human A549 lung cancer cells, where ADH1 is minimally expressed. In summary, human ADH1 and SORD catalyze the conversion of erythrose to erythritol, pointing to novel roles for two dehydrogenase proteins in human glucose metabolism that may contribute to individual responses to diet. Proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD015178.	eng	16095	16108	The Journal of biological chemistry	294	44	2019	Nov	01	D000072283;D000426/Q000378;D000818;D004896/Q000096;D006801;D007064/Q000378;D008099/Q000201;D008099/Q000378;D011817;D013780/Q000378	A549 Cells;Alcohol Dehydrogenase/metabolism;Animals;Erythritol/biosynthesis;Humans;L-Iditol 2-Dehydrogenase/metabolism;Liver/enzymology;Liver/metabolism;Rabbits;Tetroses/metabolism	Schlicker L;Szebenyi DME;Ortiz SR;Heinz A;Hiller K;Field MS	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.RA119.009049		erythro	True
961	31385330	Metabolic impact of red blood cell exchange with rejuvenated red blood cells in sickle cell patients.	Red blood cell exchange (RCE) transfusions are a mainstay in the treatment of sickle cell anemia (SCA), and allow a temporary restoration of physiological parameters with respect to erythrocyte oxygen carrying capacity and systems metabolism. Recently, we noted that 1) RCE significantly impacts recipients' metabolism in SCA; 2) fresh and end-of-storage red blood cell (RBC) units differently impact systems of metabolism in healthy autologous recipients; and 3) phosphate/inosine/pyruvate/adenine (PIPA) solution reverses the metabolic age of stored RBCs. Therefore, we hypothesized that RCE with PIPA-treated RBC units could further increase the metabolic benefits of RCE in SCA patients.	eng	3102	3112	Transfusion	59	10	2019	Oct		D000328;D000755/Q000378;D000755/Q000628;D017707/Q000379;D004912/Q000378;D005078;D006801;D008297;D055432;D010427;D010968/Q000378;D011687/Q000378	Adult;Anemia, Sickle Cell/metabolism;Anemia, Sickle Cell/therapy;Erythrocyte Transfusion/methods;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Exchange Transfusion, Whole Blood;Humans;Male;Metabolomics;Pentose Phosphate Pathway;Plasticizers/metabolism;Purines/metabolism	Gehrke S;Shah N;Gamboni F;Kamyszek R;Srinivasan AJ;Gray A;Landrigan M;Welsby I;D'Alessandro A	Journal, Articles					10.1111/trf.15467		Erythrocyte;Red blood cell;red blood cell;erythrocyte;RBC	True
962	31646528	Calcium Channels and Calcium-Regulated Channels in Human Red Blood Cells.	Free Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is an important and universal signalling entity in all cells, red blood cells included. Although mature mammalian red blood cells are believed to not contain organelles as Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria, a 20,000-fold gradient based on a intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration of approximately 60 nM vs. an extracellular concentration of 1.2 mM makes Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels a major signalling tool of red blood cells. However, the internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is tightly controlled, regulated and maintained primarily by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps PMCA1 and PMCA4. Within the last two decades it became evident that an increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is associated with red blood cell clearance in the spleen and promotes red blood cell aggregability and clot formation. In contrast to this rather uncontrolled deadly Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals only recently it became evident, that a temporal increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can also have positive effects such as the modulation of the red blood cells O<sub>2</sub> binding properties or even be vital for brief transient cellular volume adaptation when passing constrictions like small capillaries or slits in the spleen. Here we give an overview of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated channels in red blood cells, namely the Gárdos channel, the non-selective voltage dependent cation channel, Piezo1, the NMDA receptor, VDAC, TRPC channels, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inhibited channel novel to red blood cells and i.a. relate these channels to the molecular unknown sickle cell disease conductance P<sub>sickle</sub>. Particular attention is given to correlation of functional measurements with molecular entities as well as the physiological and pathophysiological function of these channels. This view is in constant progress and in particular the understanding of the interaction of several ion channels in a physiological context just started. This includes on the one hand channelopathies, where a mutation of the ion channel is the direct cause of the disease, like Hereditary Xerocytosis and the Gárdos Channelopathy. On the other hand it applies to red blood cell related diseases where an altered channel activity is a secondary effect like in sickle cell disease or thalassemia. Also these secondary effects should receive medical and pharmacologic attention because they can be crucial when it comes to the life-threatening symptoms of the disease.	eng	625	648	Advances in experimental medicine and biology	1131		2020			D000818;D002118/Q000378;D015220/Q000235;D015220/Q000378;D004912/Q000502;D006402/Q000503;D006801;D009154	Animals;Calcium/metabolism;Calcium Channels/genetics;Calcium Channels/metabolism;Erythrocytes/physiology;Hematologic Diseases/physiopathology;Humans;Mutation	Kaestner L;Bogdanova A;Egee S	Journal, Articles					10.1007/978-3-030-12457-1_25		red blood cell;Erythrocyte;Red Blood Cell	True

965	32694608	NRH salvage and conversion to NAD<sup>+</sup> requires NRH kinase activity by adenosine kinase.	Dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH) has been suggested to act as a precursor for the synthesis of NAD<sup>+</sup>, but the biochemical pathway converting it has been unknown. Here, we show that NRH can be converted into NAD<sup>+</sup> via a salvage pathway in which adenosine kinase (ADK, also known as AK) acts as an NRH kinase. Using isotope-labelling approaches, we demonstrate that NRH is fully incorporated into NAD<sup>+</sup>, with NMNH acting as an intermediate. We further show that AK is enriched in fractions from cell lysates with NRH kinase activity, and that AK can convert NRH into NAD<sup>+</sup>. In cultured cells and mouse liver, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of AK blocks formation of reduced nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMNH) and inhibits NRH-stimulated NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis. Finally, we confirm the presence of endogenous NRH in the liver with metabolomics. Our findings establish NRH as a natural precursor of NAD<sup>+</sup> and reveal a new route for NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis via an NRH salvage pathway involving AK.	eng	364	379	Nature metabolism	2	4	2020	Apr		D000248/Q000378;D000818;D002478;D051379;D009243/Q000378;D009536/Q000031;D009536/Q000378;D010766	Adenosine Kinase/metabolism;Animals;Cells, Cultured;Mice;NAD/metabolism;Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives;Niacinamide/metabolism;Phosphorylation	Yang Y;Zhang N;Zhang G;Sauve AA	Journal, Articles					10.1038/s42255-020-0194-9		red cell	True

967	32907987	Cholesterol transport between red blood cells and lipoproteins contributes to cholesterol metabolism in blood.	Lipoproteins play a key role in transport of cholesterol to and from tissues. Recent studies have also demonstrated that red blood cells (RBCs), which carry large quantities of free cholesterol in their membrane, play an important role in reverse cholesterol transport. However, the exact role of RBCs in systemic cholesterol metabolism is poorly understood. RBCs were incubated with autologous plasma or isolated lipoproteins resulting in a significant net amount of cholesterol moved from RBCs to HDL, while cholesterol from LDL moved in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the bi-directional cholesterol transport between RBCs and plasma lipoproteins was saturable and temperature-, energy-, and time-dependent, consistent with an active process. We did not find LDLR, ABCG1, or scavenger receptor class B type 1 in RBCs but found a substantial amount of ABCA1 mRNA and protein. However, specific cholesterol efflux from RBCs to isolated apoA-I was negligible, and ABCA1 silencing with siRNA or inhibition with vanadate and Probucol did not inhibit the efflux to apoA-I, HDL, or plasma. Cholesterol efflux from and cholesterol uptake by RBCs from <i>Abca1</i><sup>+/+</sup> and <i>Abca1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice were similar, arguing against the role of ABCA1 in cholesterol flux between RBCs and lipoproteins. Bioinformatics analysis identified ABCA7, ABCG5, lipoprotein lipase, and mitochondrial translocator protein as possible candidates that may mediate the cholesterol flux. Together, these results suggest that RBCs actively participate in cholesterol transport in the blood, but the role of cholesterol transporters in RBCs remains uncertain.	eng	1577	1588	Journal of lipid research	61	12	2020	Dec		D001692;D002784/Q000378;D019295;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D008074/Q000378	Biological Transport;Cholesterol/metabolism;Computational Biology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Lipoproteins/metabolism	Ohkawa R;Low H;Mukhamedova N;Fu Y;Lai SJ;Sasaoka M;Hara A;Yamazaki A;Kameda T;Horiuchi Y;Meikle PJ;Pernes G;Lancaster G;Ditiatkovski M;Nestel P;Vaisman B;Sviridov D;Murphy A;Remaley AT;Tozuka M	Journal, Articles					10.1194/jlr.RA120000635		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
968	33103382	Reduction in flippase activity contributes to surface presentation of phosphatidylserine in human senescent erythrocytes.	Mature human erythrocytes circulate in blood for approximately 120 days, and senescent erythrocytes are removed by splenic macrophages. During this process, the cell membranes of senescent erythrocytes express phosphatidylserine, which is recognized as a signal for phagocytosis by macrophages. However, the mechanisms underlying phosphatidylserine exposure in senescent erythrocytes remain unclear. To clarify these mechanisms, we isolated senescent erythrocytes using density gradient centrifugation and applied fluorescence-labelled lipids to investigate the flippase and scramblase activities. Senescent erythrocytes showed a decrease in flippase activity but not scramblase activity. Intracellular ATP and K<sup>+</sup> , the known influential factors on flippase activity, were altered in senescent erythrocytes. Furthermore, quantification by immunoblotting showed that the main flippase molecule in erythrocytes, ATP11C, was partially lost in the senescent cells. Collectively, these results suggest that multiple factors, including altered intracellular substances and reduced ATP11C levels, contribute to decreased flippase activity in senescent erythrocytes in turn to, present phosphatidylserine on their cell membrane. The present study may enable the identification of novel therapeutic approaches for anaemic states, such as those in inflammatory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, or renal anaemia, resulting from the abnormally shortened lifespan of erythrocytes.	eng	13991	14000	Journal of cellular and molecular medicine	24	23	2020	Dec		D000251/Q000235;D000251/Q000378;D000255/Q000378;D001692;D002118/Q000378;D055252/Q000378;D016922/Q000235;D004789;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D026901/Q000235;D026901/Q000378;D010718/Q000378;D011188/Q000378	Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics;Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Biological Transport;Calcium/metabolism;Cell-Derived Microparticles/metabolism;Cellular Senescence/genetics;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics;Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism;Phosphatidylserines/metabolism;Potassium/metabolism	Seki M;Arashiki N;Takakuwa Y;Nitta K;Nakamura F	Journal, Articles					10.1111/jcmm.16010		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

The Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia (CDA) Registry was established with the goal to facilitate investigations of natural history, biology, and molecular pathogenetic mechanisms of CDA. Three unrelated individuals enrolled in the registry had a syndrome characterized by CDA and severe neurodevelopmental delay. They were found to have missense mutations in VPS4A, a gene coding for an ATPase that regulates the ESCRT-III machinery in a variety of cellular processes including cell division, endosomal vesicle trafficking, and viral budding. Bone marrow studies showed binucleated erythroblasts and erythroblasts with cytoplasmic bridges indicating abnormal cytokinesis and abscission. Circulating red blood cells were found to retain transferrin receptor (CD71) in their membrane, demonstrating that VPS4A is critical for normal reticulocyte maturation. Using proband-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we have successfully modeled the hematologic aspects of this syndrome in vitro, recapitulating their dyserythropoietic phenotype. Our findings demonstrate that VPS4A mutations cause cytokinesis and trafficking defects leading to a human disease with detrimental effects to erythropoiesis and neurodevelopment.	eng	1149	1156	American journal of human genetics	107	6	2020	Dec	03	D000074183/Q000235;D000251/Q000378;D000742/Q000235;D000742/Q000473;D001853/Q000473;D001854/Q000378;D002648;D002675;D048749;D056827/Q000235;D011992/Q000378;D004900/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004920;D005260;D006801;D057026/Q000166;D008297;D065886/Q000378;D010641;D021381;D012156/Q000166;D025262/Q000235	ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities/genetics;Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism;Anemia, Dyserythropoietic, Congenital/genetics;Anemia, Dyserythropoietic, Congenital/pathology;Bone Marrow/pathology;Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism;Child;Child, Preschool;Cytokinesis;Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport/genetics;Endosomes/metabolism;Erythroblasts/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythropoiesis;Female;Humans;Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology;Male;Neurodevelopmental Disorders/metabolism;Phenotype;Protein Transport;Reticulocytes/cytology;Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases/genetics	Seu KG;Trump LR;Emberesh S;Lorsbach RB;Johnson C;Meznarich J;Underhill HR;Chou ST;Sakthivel H;Nassar NN;Seu KJ;Blanc L;Zhang W;Lutzko CM;Kalfa TA	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.10.013		Erythrocyte;Erythro;red blood cell;erythro	True
970	33328606	Characterization of the erythrocyte GTPase Rac1 in relation to Plasmodium falciparum invasion.	Malaria is still a devastating disease with 228 million cases globally and 405,000 lethal outcomes in 2018, mainly in children under five years of age. The threat of emerging malaria strains resistant to currently available drugs has made the search for novel drug targets compelling. The process by which Plasmodium falciparum parasites invade the host cell has been widely studied, but only a few erythrocyte proteins involved in this process have been identified so far. The erythrocyte protein Rac1 is a GTPase that plays an important role in host cell invasion by many intracellular pathogens. Here we show that Rac1 is recruited in proximity to the site of parasite entry during P. falciparum invasion process and that subsequently localizes to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. We also suggest that this GTPase may be involved in erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum, by testing the effect of specific Rac1 inhibitory compounds. Finally, we suggest a secondary role of the erythrocyte GTPase also in parasite intracellular development. We here characterize a new erythrocyte protein potentially involved in P. falciparum invasion of the host cell and propose the human GTPase Rac1 as a novel and promising antimalarial drug target.	eng	22054		Scientific reports	10	1	2020	Dec	16	D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000469;D006801;D007425/Q000378;D010963/Q000378;D014617/Q000378;D014617/Q000469;D020830/Q000378	Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Humans;Intracellular Membranes/metabolism;Plasmodium falciparum/metabolism;Vacuoles/metabolism;Vacuoles/parasitology;rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism	Paone S;D'Alessandro S;Parapini S;Celani F;Tirelli V;Pourshaban M;Olivieri A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
971	33352721	Transferrin Receptors in Erythropoiesis.	Erythropoiesis is a highly dynamic process giving rise to red blood cells from hematopoietic stem cells present in the bone marrow. Red blood cells transport oxygen to tissues thanks to the hemoglobin comprised of α- and β-globin chains and of iron-containing hemes. Erythropoiesis is the most iron-consuming process to support hemoglobin production. Iron delivery is mediated via transferrin internalization by the endocytosis of transferrin receptor type 1 (TFR1), one of the most abundant membrane proteins of erythroblasts. A second transferrin receptor-TFR2-associates with the erythropoietin receptor and has been implicated in the regulation of erythropoiesis. In erythroblasts, both transferrin receptors adopt peculiarities such as an erythroid-specific regulation of TFR1 and a trafficking pathway reliant on TFR2 for iron. This review reports both trafficking and signaling functions of these receptors and reassesses the debated role of TFR2 in erythropoiesis in the light of recent findings. Potential therapeutic uses targeting the transferrin-TFR1 axis or TFR2 in hematological disorders are also discussed.	eng			International journal of molecular sciences	21	24	2020	Dec	19	D000818;D004920;D006402/Q000503;D006801;D011990/Q000378	Animals;Erythropoiesis;Hematologic Diseases/physiopathology;Humans;Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism	Richard C;Verdier F	Journal, Articles							erythro;Erythro;red blood cell;Red blood cell	True
972	31530173	A Novel Possible Role for Met Hemoglobin as Carrier of Hydrogen Sulfide in the Blood.	<b><i>Significance:</i></b> Along with other gasotransmitters nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) has recently emerged as an important signaling molecule with a particularly complex metabolism. Endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S reacts with multiple cellular targets, including protein ferric heme groups, to elicit physiological responses, such as regulation of local blood flow. <b><i>Recent Advances:</i></b> Recent <i>in vitro</i> evidence suggests that H<sub>2</sub>S at low physiological concentrations is carried in the blood as bound to the small fraction of oxidized ferric hemoglobin (metHb). A relatively stable metHb-sulfide complex forms when H<sub>2</sub>S and purified metHb react <i>in vitro</i>, with an affinity within the <i>in vivo</i> physiological range of sulfide in the blood. Formation and subsequent redox metabolism of metHb-sulfide complex have also been confirmed in isolated intact red blood cells (RBCs) containing enhanced metHb levels. Thus, H<sub>2</sub>S may function as an endocrine signaling molecule and elicit responses at sites away from the site of production. In addition, metHb, considered as an inert or pathological hemoglobin derivative, may have a novel potential physiological role in the transport of H<sub>2</sub>S in the blood. <b><i>Critical Issues:</i></b> The transport of H<sub>2</sub>S in the blood mediated by metHb would represent an O<sub>2</sub>-independent pH-dependent mechanism for the blood-mediated control of blood flow and as such it is critical to understand the <i>in vivo</i> significance of this transport. <b><i>Future Directions:</i></b> Major challenges must be resolved to understand how metHb may carry H<sub>2</sub>S in the RBCs, in particular determination of metHb-sulfide levels in the blood and identification of targets in the vasculature.	eng	258	265	Antioxidants & redox signaling	32	4	2020	Feb	01	D000818;D004912/Q000737;D006801;D006862/Q000097;D006862/Q000378;D008706/Q000378;D010084;D015398	Animals;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Humans;Hydrogen Sulfide/blood;Hydrogen Sulfide/metabolism;Methemoglobin/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Signal Transduction	Jensen B;Fago A	Journal, Articles					10.1089/ars.2019.7877		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
973	32222693	Lysophosphatidic acid-induced pro-thrombotic phosphatidylserine exposure and ionophore-induced microvesiculation is mediated by the scramblase TMEM16F in erythrocytes.	Recent studies indicate that erythrocytes actively modulate blood clotting and thrombus formation. The lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is produced by activated platelets, and triggers a signaling process in erythrocytes. This results in cellular calcium uptake and exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) at the cell surface, thereby generating activated membrane binding sites for factors of the clotting cascade. Moreover, erythrocytes of patients with a bleeding disorder and mutations in the scramblase TMEM16F show impaired PS exposure and microvesiculation upon treatment with calcium ionophore. We report that TMEM16F inhibitors tannic acid (TA) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibit LPA-induced PS exposure and calcium uptake at low micromolar concentrations; fluoxetine, an antidepressant and a known activator of TMEM16F, enhances these processes. These effectors likewise modulate erythrocyte PS exposure and microvesicle shedding induced by calcium ionophore treatment. Further, LPA-treated erythrocytes triggered thrombin generation in platelet-free plasma which was partially impaired in the presence of TA and EGCG. Thus, this study suggests that LPA activates the scramblase TMEM16F in erythrocytes, thereby possibly mediating a pro-thrombotic function in these cells. EGCG as well as fluoxetine, substances with potentially high plasma concentrations due to alimentation or medical treatment, should be considered as potential effectors of systemic hemostatic regulation.	eng	102426		Blood cells, molecules & diseases	83		2020	Jul		D000075368/Q000378;D055252/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000378;D006487;D006801;D008246/Q000378;D010718/Q000378;D049294/Q000378;D013917/Q000378;D013927/Q000378	Anoctamins/metabolism;Cell-Derived Microparticles/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemostasis;Humans;Lysophospholipids/metabolism;Phosphatidylserines/metabolism;Phospholipid Transfer Proteins/metabolism;Thrombin/metabolism;Thrombosis/metabolism	Öhlinger T;Müllner EW;Fritz M;Sauer T;Werning M;Baron DM;Salzer U	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bcmd.2020.102426		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

975	32678227	Cdc42 regulates cell polarization and contractile actomyosin rings during terminal differentiation of human erythroblasts.	The molecular mechanisms involved in the terminal differentiation of erythroblasts have been elucidated by comparing enucleation and cell division. Although various similarities and differences between erythroblast enucleation and cytokinesis have been reported, the mechanisms that control enucleation remain unclear. We previously reported that dynein and microtubule-organizing centers mediated the polarization of nuclei in human erythroblasts. Moreover, the accumulation of F-actin was noted during the enucleation of erythroblasts. Therefore, during enucleation, upstream effectors in the signal transduction pathway regulating dynein or actin, such as cell division control protein 42 homolog (Cdc42), may be crucial. We herein investigated the effects of the Cdc42 inhibitor, CASIN, on cytokinesis and enucleation in colony-forming units-erythroid (CFU-Es) and mature erythroblasts (day 10). CASIN blocked the proliferation of CFU-Es and their enucleation in a dose-dependent manner. Dynein adopted an island-like distribution in the cytoplasm of non-treated CFU-Es, but was concentrated near the nucleus as a dot and co-localized with γ-tubulin in CASIN-treated cells. CASIN blocked the accumulation of F-actin in CFU-Es and day 10 cells. These results demonstrated that Cdc42 plays an important role in cytokinesis, nuclear polarization and nuclear extrusion through a relationship with dynein and actin filament organization during the terminal differentiation of erythroblasts.	eng	11806		Scientific reports	10	1	2020	Jul	16	D000205/Q000378;D015415;D002454/Q000235;D002467/Q000378;D004900/Q000166;D004900/Q000378;D015672/Q000166;D015672/Q000378;D004920/Q000235;D005455;D015870;D006801;D007150;D020764/Q000235;D020764/Q000378	Actomyosin/metabolism;Biomarkers;Cell Differentiation/genetics;Cell Nucleus/metabolism;Erythroblasts/cytology;Erythroblasts/metabolism;Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology;Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism;Erythropoiesis/genetics;Fluorescent Antibody Technique;Gene Expression;Humans;Immunohistochemistry;cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/genetics;cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism	Ubukawa K;Goto T;Asanuma K;Sasaki Y;Guo YM;Kobayashi I;Sawada K;Wakui H;Takahashi N	Journal, Articles							Erythro;erythro	True

978	32367017	Plasma membranes are asymmetric in lipid unsaturation, packing and protein shape.	A fundamental feature of cellular plasma membranes (PMs) is an asymmetric lipid distribution between the bilayer leaflets. However, neither the detailed, comprehensive compositions of individual PM leaflets nor how these contribute to structural membrane asymmetries have been defined. We report the distinct lipidomes and biophysical properties of both monolayers in living mammalian PMs. Phospholipid unsaturation is dramatically asymmetric, with the cytoplasmic leaflet being approximately twofold more unsaturated than the exoplasmic leaflet. Atomistic simulations and spectroscopy of leaflet-selective fluorescent probes reveal that the outer PM leaflet is more packed and less diffusive than the inner leaflet, with this biophysical asymmetry maintained in the endocytic system. The structural asymmetry of the PM is reflected in the asymmetric structures of protein transmembrane domains. These structural asymmetries are conserved throughout Eukaryota, suggesting fundamental cellular design principles.	eng	644	652	Nature chemical biology	16	6	2020	Jun		D002462/Q000378;D004058;D004912/Q000378;D005456/Q000737;D006801;D008051/Q000737;D050356;D008560;D021962;D008565/Q000737;D061848;D044367;D010743/Q000737;D011487;D011726/Q000737	Cell Membrane/metabolism;Diffusion;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry;Humans;Lipid Bilayers/chemistry;Lipid Metabolism;Membrane Fluidity;Membrane Microdomains;Membrane Proteins/chemistry;Optical Imaging;Phase Transition;Phospholipids/chemistry;Protein Conformation;Pyridinium Compounds/chemistry	Lorent JH;Levental KR;Ganesan L;Rivera-Longsworth G;Sezgin E;Doktorova M;Lyman E;Levental I	Journal, Articles					10.1038/s41589-020-0529-6		Erythrocyte	True
979	32062367	GC-MS and LC-MS/MS pilot studies on the guanidine (N<sup>G</sup>)-dimethylation in native, asymmetrically and symmetrically N<sup>G</sup>-dimethylated arginine-vasopressin peptides and proteins in human red blood cells.	Protein-arginine methyltransferases catalyze the methylation of the guanidine (N<sup>G</sup>) group of proteinic L-arginine (Arg) to produce monomethyl and dimethylarginine proteins. Their proteolysis releases the free amino acids monomethylarginine (MMA), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), respectively. MMA, SDMA and ADMA are inhibitors of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. High circulating and low urinary concentrations of ADMA and SDMA are considered risk factors in the cardiovascular and renal systems, mainly due to their inhibitory action on NOS activity. Identity, biological activity and concentration of N<sup>G</sup>-methylated proteins are largely unknown. The present study addressed these issues by using GC-MS and LC-MS/MS approaches. GC-MS was used to quantify free ADMA released by classical HCl-catalyzed hydrolysis of three synthetic Arg-vasopressin (V) peptides and of unknown endogenous N<sup>G</sup>-dimethylated proteins. The cyclic (c) disulfide forms of Arg-vasopressin analogs, i.e., Arg-vasopressin (cV-Arg-Gly-NH<sub>2</sub>), asymmetrically N<sup>G</sup>-dimethylated vasopressin (cV-ADMA-Gly-NH<sub>2</sub>) and symmetrically N<sup>G</sup>-dimethylated vasopressin (cV-SDMA-Gly-NH<sub>2</sub>) were used as model peptides in quantitative GC-MS analyses of ADMA, SDMA and other expected amino acids from the hydrolyzed Arg-vasopressin analogs. cV-ADMA-Gly-NH<sub>2</sub> and cV-SDMA-Gly-NH<sub>2</sub> were discriminated from cV-Arg-Gly-NH<sub>2</sub> by LC-MS and LC-MS/MS, yet they were indistinguishable from each other. The same applies to the respective open (o) reduced and di-S-acetamide forms of oV-ADMA-Gly-NH<sub>2</sub>, oV-SDMA-Gly-NH<sub>2</sub> and oV-Arg-Gly-NH<sub>2</sub>. Our LC-MS and LC-MS/MS studies suggest that the Arg-vasopressin analogs form [(M-H)]<sup>+</sup> and [(M-H)+H]<sup>+</sup> in the positive ESI mode and undergo in part conversion of their terminal Gly-NH<sub>2</sub> (NH<sub>2</sub>, 16 Da) group to Gly-OH (OH, 17 Da). The product ion mass spectra of the di-S-acetamide forms are complex and contain several intense mass fragments differing by 1 Da. cV-ADMA-Gly-NH<sub>2</sub> and cV-SDMA-Gly-NH<sub>2</sub> induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich human plasma with moderately different initial velocity and maximal aggregation rates compared to cV-Arg-Gly-NH<sub>2</sub>. Previous studies showed that human red blood cells are rich in large (>50 kDa) ADMA-containing proteins of unknown identity. Our LC-MS/MS proteomic study identified several membrane and cytosolic erythrocytic N<sup>G</sup>-dimethylated proteins, including spectrin-α (280 kDa), spectrin-β (247 kDa) and protein 4.1 (80 kDa). Being responsible for the stability of the erythrocyte membrane, the newly identified main targets for N<sup>G</sup>-dimethylation in human erythrocytes should be given a closer look in erythrocytic diseases like hereditary spherocytosis.	eng	122024		Journal of chromatography.

980	32075750	The Interplay between Molten Globules and Heme Disassociation Defines Human Hemoglobin Disassembly.	Hemoglobin functions as a tetrameric oxygen transport protein, with each subunit containing a heme cofactor. Its denaturation, either in vivo or in vitro, involves autoxidation to methemoglobin, followed by cofactor loss and globin unfolding. We have proposed a global disassembly scheme for human methemoglobin, linking hemin (ferric protoporphyrin IX) disassociation and apoprotein unfolding pathways. The model is based on the evaluation of circular dichroism and visible absorbance measurements of guanidine-hydrochloride-induced disassembly of methemoglobin and previous measurements of apohemoglobin unfolding. The populations of holointermediates and equilibrium disassembly parameters were estimated quantitatively for adult and fetal hemoglobins. The key stages are characterized by hexacoordinated hemichrome intermediates, which are important for preventing hemin disassociation from partially unfolded, molten globular species during early disassembly and late-stage assembly events. Both unfolding experiments and independent small angle x-ray scattering measurements demonstrate that heme disassociation leads to the loss of tetrameric structural integrity. Our model predicts that after autoxidation, dimeric and monomeric hemichrome intermediates occur along the disassembly pathway inside red cells, where the hemoglobin concentration is very high. This prediction suggests why misassembled hemoglobins often get trapped as hemichromes that accumulate into insoluble Heinz bodies in the red cells of patients with unstable hemoglobinopathies. These Heinz bodies become deposited on the cell membranes and can lead to hemolysis. Alternatively, when acellular hemoglobin is diluted into blood plasma after red cell lysis, the disassembly pathway appears to be dominated by early hemin disassociation events, which leads to the generation of higher fractions of unfolded apo subunits and free hemin, which are known to damage the integrity of blood vessel walls. Thus, our model provides explanations of the pathophysiology of hemoglobinopathies and other disease states associated with unstable globins and red cell lysis and also insights into the factors governing hemoglobin assembly during erythropoiesis.	eng	1381	1400	Biophysical journal	118	6	2020	Mar	24	D004912;D006418;D006454;D006461;D006801;D008706	Erythrocytes;Heme;Hemoglobins;Hemolysis;Humans;Methemoglobin	Samuel PP;White MA;Ou WC;Case DA;Phillips GN;Olson JS	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bpj.2020.01.031		Erythrocyte;red cell;erythro	True
981	31654099	Human erythrocytes: cytoskeleton and its origin.	In the last few years, erythrocytes have emerged as the main determinant of blood rheology. In mammals, these cells are devoid of nuclei and are, therefore, unable to divide. Consequently, all circulating erythrocytes come from erythropoiesis, a process in the bone marrow in which several modifications are induced in the expression of membrane and cytoskeletal proteins, and different vertical and horizontal interactions are established between them. Cytoskeleton components play an important role in this process, which explains why they and the interaction between them have been the focus of much recent research. Moreover, in mature erythrocytes, the cytoskeleton integrity is also essential, because the cytoskeleton confers remarkable deformability and stability on the erythrocytes, thus enabling them to undergo deformation in microcirculation. Defects in the cytoskeleton produce changes in erythrocyte deformability and stability, affecting cell viability and rheological properties. Such abnormalities are seen in different pathologies of special interest, such as different types of anemia, hypertension, and diabetes, among others. This review highlights the main findings in mammalian erythrocytes and their progenitors regarding the presence, conformation and function of the three main components of the cytoskeleton: actin, intermediate filaments, and tubulin.	eng	1681	1694	Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS	77	9	2020	May		D000199/Q000378;D000818;D003598/Q000378;D003599/Q000378;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000502;D006801;D012212;D014404/Q000378	Actins/metabolism;Animals;Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism;Cytoskeleton/metabolism;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/physiology;Humans;Rheology;Tubulin/metabolism	Nigra AD;Casale CH;Santander VS	Journal, Articles					10.1007/s00018-019-03346-4		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
982	31812320	The emerging role of red blood cells in cytokine signalling and modulating immune cells.	For many years red blood cells have been described as inert bystanders rather than participants in intercellular signalling, immune function, and inflammatory processes. However, studies are now reporting that red blood cells from healthy individuals regulate immune cell activity and maturation, and red blood cells from disease cohorts are dysfunctional. These cells have now been shown to bind more than 50 cytokines and have been described as a sink for these molecules, and the loss of this activity has been correlated with disease progression. In this review, we summarise what is currently understood about the role of red blood cells in cytokine signalling and in modulating the activity of immune cells. We also discuss the implications of these findings for transfusion medicine and in furthering our understanding of anaemia of chronic inflammation. By bringing these disparate units of work together, we aim to shine a light on an area that requires significantly more investigation.	eng	100644		Blood reviews	41		2020	May		D000818;D016207/Q000276;D004375/Q000276;D017707/Q000009;D004912/Q000276;D006801;D007249/Q000276;D051660/Q000276;D019746/Q000276;D008263/Q000276;D011956/Q000276;D015398	Animals;Cytokines/immunology;Duffy Blood-Group System/immunology;Erythrocyte Transfusion/adverse effects;Erythrocytes/immunology;Humans;Inflammation/immunology;Intermediate-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels/immunology;Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/immunology;Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/immunology;Receptors, Cell Surface/immunology;Signal Transduction	Karsten E;Herbert BR	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.blre.2019.100644		Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
983	32318874	Evidence that human and equine erythrocytes could have significant roles in the transport and delivery of amino acids to organs and tissues.	Erythrocytes have a well-defined role in the gaseous exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the mammalian body. The erythrocytes can contain more than half of the free amino acids present in whole blood. Based on measures showing that venous erythrocyte levels of amino acids are much less than arterial erythrocyte levels, it has previously been proposed that erythrocytes also play a role in the delivery of amino acids to tissues in the body. This role has been dismissed because it has been assumed that to act as an amino acid transport vehicle, the erythrocytes should release their entire amino acid content in the capillary beds at the target tissues with kinetic studies showing that this would take too long to achieve. This investigation set out to investigate whether the equine erythrocytes could rapidly take up and release smaller packages of amino acids when exposed to high or low external concentrations of amino acids, because it seemed very unlikely that cells would be able to release all of their amino acids without serious impacts on osmotic balance. Freshly prepared erythrocytes were placed in alternating solutions of high and low amino acid concentrations in PBS to assess the capacities of these cells to rapidly take up and release amino acids depending on the nature of the external environment. It was found that amino acids were rapidly taken up and released in small quantities in each cycle representing 15% of their total load in equine erythrocytes and 16% in human erythrocytes. The capacity for rapid uptake/release of amino acids by equine and human erythrocytes provided evidence to support the theory that mammalian erythrocytes have a significant role in transport of amino acids from the liver to tissues, muscles and organs.	eng	711	724	Amino acids	52	5	2020	May		D000596/Q000493;D000818;D001692;D004912/Q000378;D006736;D006801;D008099/Q000098;D008099/Q000378;D008297;D008875;D009132/Q000098;D009132/Q000378;D014018	Amino Acids/pharmacokinetics;Animals;Biological Transport;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Horses;Humans;Liver/blood supply;Liver/metabolism;Male;Middle Aged;Muscles/blood supply;Muscles/metabolism;Tissue Distribution	Thorn B;Dunstan RH;Macdonald MM;Borges N;Roberts TK	Journal, Articles					10.1007/s00726-020-02845-0		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
984	33103907	Evidence of Structural Protein Damage and Membrane Lipid Remodeling in Red Blood Cells from COVID-19 Patients.	The SARS-CoV-2 beta coronavirus is the etiological driver of COVID-19 disease, which is primarily characterized by shortness of breath, persistent dry cough, and fever. Because they transport oxygen, red blood cells (RBCs) may play a role in the severity of hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. The present study combines state-of-the-art metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics approaches to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on RBCs from 23 healthy subjects and 29 molecularly diagnosed COVID-19 patients. RBCs from COVID-19 patients had increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, accompanied by oxidation and fragmentation of ankyrin, spectrin beta, and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3 (AE1). Significantly altered lipid metabolism was also observed, in particular, short- and medium-chain saturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, and sphingolipids. Nonetheless, there were no alterations of clinical hematological parameters, such as RBC count, hematocrit, or mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, with only minor increases in mean corpuscular volume. Taken together, these results suggest a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RBC structural membrane homeostasis at the protein and lipid levels. Increases in RBC glycolytic metabolites are consistent with a theoretically improved capacity of hemoglobin to off-load oxygen as a function of allosteric modulation by high-energy phosphate compounds, perhaps to counteract COVID-19-induced hypoxia. Conversely, because the N-terminus of AE1 stabilizes deoxyhemoglobin and finely tunes oxygen off-loading and metabolic rewiring toward the hexose monophosphate shunt, RBCs from COVID-19 patients may be less capable of responding to environmental variations in hemoglobin oxygen saturation/oxidant stress when traveling from the lungs to peripheral capillaries and vice versa.	eng	4455	4469	Journal of proteome research	19	11	2020	Nov	06	D000073640;D000086382;D018352/Q000097;D018352/Q000473;D018352/Q000503;D004912/Q000737;D004912/Q000166;D004912/Q000473;D006801;D000081362;D008563/Q000032;D008563/Q000737;D008563/Q000378;D008565/Q000032;D008565/Q000737;D008565/Q000378;D055442/Q000502;D008958;D058873;D011024/Q000097;D011024/Q000473;D011024/Q000503;D020543/Q000032;D020543/Q000737;D020543/Q000378;D000086402	Betacoronavirus;COVID-19;Coronavirus Infections/blood;Coronavirus Infections/pathology;Coronavirus Infections/physiopathology;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Erythrocytes/cytology;Erythrocytes/pathology;Humans;Lipidomics;Membrane Lipids/analysis;Membrane Lipids/chemistry;Membrane Lipids/metabolism;Membrane Proteins/analysis;Membrane Proteins/chemistry;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Metabolome/physiology;Models, Molecular;Pandemics;Pneumonia, Viral/blood;Pneumonia, Viral/pathology;Pneumonia, Viral/physiopathology;Proteome/analysis;Proteome/chemistry;Proteome/metabolism;SARS-CoV-2	Thomas T;Stefanoni D;Dzieciatkowska M;Issaian A;Nemkov T;Hill RC;Francis RO;Hudson KE;Buehler PW;Zimring JC;Hod EA;Hansen KC;Spitalnik SL;D'Alessandro A	Journal, Articles					10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00606		RBC;red blood cell;Erythrocyte;Red Blood Cell	True
985	32652143	Human red blood cell uptake and sequestration of arsenite and selenite: Evidence of seleno-bis(S-glutathionyl) arsinium ion formation in human cells.	Over 200 million people worldwide are exposed to the human carcinogen, arsenic, in contaminated drinking water. In laboratory animals, arsenic and the essential trace element, selenium, can undergo mutual detoxification through the formation of the seleno-bis(S-glutathionyl) arsinium ion [(GS)<sub>2</sub>AsSe]<sup>-</sup>, which undergoes biliary and fecal elimination. [(GS)<sub>2</sub>AsSe]<sup>-</sup>, formed in animal red blood cells (RBCs), sequesters arsenic and selenium, and slows the distribution of both compounds to peripheral tissues susceptible to toxic effects. In human RBCs, the influence of arsenic on selenium accumulation, and vice versa, is largely unknown. The study aims were to characterize arsenite (As<sup>III</sup>) and selenite (Se<sup>IV</sup>) uptake by human RBCs, to determine if Se<sup>IV</sup> and As<sup>III</sup> increase the respective accumulation of the other in human RBCs, and ultimately to determine if this occurs through the formation and sequestration of [(GS)<sub>2</sub>AsSe]<sup>-</sup>. <sup>75</sup>Se<sup>IV</sup> accumulation was temperature and Cl<sup>-</sup>-dependent, inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanatodihydrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>DIDS) (IC<sub>50</sub> 1 ± 0.2 µM), and approached saturation at 30 µM, suggesting uptake is mediated by the erythrocyte anion-exchanger 1 (AE1 or Band 3, gene SLC4A1). HEK293 cells overexpressing AE1 showed concentration-dependent <sup>75</sup>Se<sup>IV</sup> uptake. <sup>73</sup>As<sup>III</sup> uptake by human RBCs was temperature-dependent, partly reduced by aquaglyceroporin 3 inhibitors, and not saturated. As<sup>III</sup> increased <sup>75</sup>Se<sup>IV</sup> accumulation (in the presence of albumin) and Se<sup>IV</sup> increased <sup>73</sup>As<sup>III</sup> accumulation in human RBCs. Near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the formation of [(GS)<sub>2</sub>AsSe]<sup>-</sup> in human RBCs exposed to both As<sup>III</sup> and Se<sup>IV</sup>. The sequestration of [(GS)<sub>2</sub>AsSe]<sup>-</sup> in human RBCs potentially slows arsenic distribution to susceptible tissues and could reduce arsenic-induced disease.	eng	114141		Biochemical pharmacology	180		2020	Oct		D018053/Q000097;D018053/Q000494;D001692/Q000187;D001692/Q000502;D004305;D004912/Q000187;D004912/Q000378;D005978/Q000097;D057809;D006801;D020887/Q000097;D020887/Q000494;D056928/Q000379	Arsenites/blood;Arsenites/pharmacology;Biological Transport/drug effects;Biological Transport/physiology;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Erythrocytes/drug effects;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glutathione/blood;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Selenious Acid/blood;Selenious Acid/pharmacology;X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy/methods	Kaur G;Javed W;Ponomarenko O;Shekh K;Swanlund DP;Zhou JR;Summers KL;Casini A;Wenzel MN;Casey JR;Cordat E;Pickering IJ;George GN;Leslie EM	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bcp.2020.114141		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
986	33112511	Hemodialysis and erythrocyte epoxy fatty acids.	Fatty acid products derived from cytochromes P450 (CYP) monooxygenase and lipoxygenase (LOX)/CYP ω/(ω-1)-hydroxylase pathways are a superclass of lipid mediators with potent bioactivities. Whether or not the chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hemodialysis treatments performed on end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients affect RBC epoxy fatty acids profiles remains unknown. Measuring the products solely in plasma is suboptimal. Since such determinations invariably ignore red blood cells (RBCs) that make up 3 kg of the circulating blood. RBCs are potential reservoirs for epoxy fatty acids that regulate cardiovascular function. We studied 15 healthy persons and 15 ESRD patients undergoing regular hemodialysis treatments. We measured epoxides derived from CYP monooxygenase and metabolites derived from LOX/CYP ω/(ω-1)-hydroxylase pathways in RBCs by LC-MS/MS tandem mass spectrometry. Our data demonstrate that various CYP epoxides and LOX/CYP ω/(ω-1)-hydroxylase products are increased in RBCs of ESRD patients, compared to control subjects, including dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQs), dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acids (DiHDPAs), and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). Hemodialysis treatment did not affect the majority of those metabolites. Nevertheless, we detected more pronounced changes in free metabolite levels in RBCs after dialysis, as compared with the total RBC compartment. These findings indicate that free RBC eicosanoids should be considered more dynamic or vulnerable in CKD.	eng	e14601		Physiological reports	8	20	2020	Oct		D000328;D000368;D004912/Q000378;D015525/Q000097;D015525/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D007676/Q000097;D007676/Q000628;D008297;D008875;D006435/Q000009	Adult;Aged;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Fatty Acids, Omega-3/blood;Fatty Acids, Omega-3/metabolism;Female;Humans;Kidney Failure, Chronic/blood;Kidney Failure, Chronic/therapy;Male;Middle Aged;Renal Dialysis/adverse effects	Gollasch B;Wu G;Liu T;Dogan I;Rothe M;Gollasch M;Luft FC	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
987	32857630	Beyond oxygen transport: active role of erythrocytes in the regulation of blood flow.	It was classically thought that the function of mammalian red blood cells (RBCs) was limited to serving as a vehicle for oxygen, given the cells' abundance of cytosolic hemoglobin. Over the past decades, however, accumulating evidence indicates that RBCs have the capacity to sense low-oxygen tensions in hypoxic tissues, and, subsequently, release signaling molecules that influence the distribution of blood flow. The precise mechanisms that facilitate RBC modulation of blood flow are still being elucidated, although recent evidence indicates involvement of <i>1</i>) adenosine triphosphate, capable of binding to purinergic receptors located on the vascular wall before initiating nitric oxide (NO; a powerful vasodilator) production in endothelial cells, and/or <i>2</i>) nonvascular NO, which is now known to have several modes of production within RBCs, including an enzymatic process via a unique isoform of NO synthase (i.e., RBC-NOS), which has potential effects on the vascular smooth muscle. The physical properties of RBCs, including their tendency to form three-dimensional structures in low shear flow (i.e., aggregation) and their capacity to elongate in high shear flow (i.e., deformability), are only recently being viewed as mechanotransductive processes, with profound effects on vascular reactivity and tissue perfusion. Recent developments in intracellular signaling in RBCs, and the subsequent effects on the mechanical properties of blood, and blood flow, thus present a vivid expansion on the classic perspective of these abundant cells.	eng	H866	H872	American journal of physiology.

988	32863204	Fyn specifically Regulates the activity of red cell glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase.	Fyn is a tyrosine kinase belonging to the Src family (Src-Family-Kinase, SFK), ubiquitously expressed. Previously, we report that Fyn is important in stress erythropoiesis. Here, we show that in red cells Fyn specifically stimulates G6PD activity, resulting in a 3-fold increase enzyme catalytic activity (k<sub>cat</sub>) by phosphorylating tyrosine (Tyr)-401. We found Tyr-401 on G6PD as functional target of Fyn in normal human red blood cells (RBC), being undetectable in G6PD deficient RBCs (G6PD-Mediterranean and G6PD-Genova). Indeed, Tyr-401 is located to a region of the G6PD molecule critical for the formation of the enzymatically active dimer. Amino acid replacements in this region are mostly associated with a chronic hemolysis phenotype. Using mutagenesis approach, we demonstrated that the phosphorylation status of Tyr401 modulates the interaction of G6PD with G6P and stabilizes G6PD in a catalytically more efficient conformation. RBCs from Fyn<sup>-/-</sup>mice are defective in G6PD activity, resulting in increased susceptibility to primaquine-induced intravascular hemolysis. This negatively affected the recycling of reduced Prx2 in response to oxidative stress, indicating that defective G6PD phosphorylation impairs defense against oxidation. In human RBCs, we confirm the involvement of the thioredoxin/Prx2 system in the increase vulnerability of G6PD deficient RBCs to oxidation. In conclusion, our data suggest that Fyn is an oxidative radical sensor, and that Fyn-mediated Tyr-401 phosphorylation, by increasing G6PD activity, plays an important role in the physiology of RBCs. Failure of G6PD activation by this mechanism may be a major limiting factor in the ability of G6PD deficient RBCs to withstand oxidative stress.	eng	101639		Redox biology	36		2020	Sep		D000818;D004912;D019298;D005954;D005955/Q000235;D006461;D051379;D051076	Animals;Erythrocytes;Glucose-6-Phosphate;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase;Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency/genetics;Hemolysis;Mice;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn	Mattè A;Lupo F;Tibaldi E;Di Paolo ML;Federti E;Carpentieri A;Pucci P;Brunati AM;Cesaro L;Turrini F;Gomez Manzo S;Choi SY;Marcial Quino J;Kim DW;Pantaleo A;Xiuli A;Iatcenko I;Cappellini MD;Forni GL;De Franceschi L	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;RBC;red cell	True
989		Model Human _ Thalassemic Erythrocytes: Effect of Unpaired Purified _-Hemoglobin Chains on Normal Erythrocytes�	_ thalassemias arise from genetic defects that interfere with the synthesis of the _ hemoglobin chain and the subsequent production of the normal _2_2 hemoglobin tetramer. As a consequence of this decreased _-chain synthesis, unpaired _-hemoglobin chains are found within the red blood cell (RBC). The unstable _-chains are associated with a number of cellular defects, including: membrane-bound globin; membrane thiol oxidation; altered cytoskeletal proteins; decreased cellular and membrane deformability; and increased susceptibility to both endogenous and exogenous oxidants. Surprisingly, while significant injury to human thalassemic RBC arise from the unpaired _-chains, the underlying intra-RBC mechanisms are not easily studied in patient samples or in mouse models. To better study the fate of excess _-chains in human RBC, the model _ Thalassemic cell was developed. Model human _ thalassemic RBC is made by entrapping purified human _-chains within normal RBC via osmotic lysis and resealing. This human model allows for the systematic examination of the mechanisms underlying the _-chain mediated damage in the _ thalassemic RBC. Studies utilizing the model _ thalassemic RBC have demonstrated that the _-chains give rise to an iron and glutathione-dependent, self-amplifying and self-propagating oxidative reaction.							2020	Sep	23			Scott MD	Book, Section	Marwa Zakaria and Tamer Hassan	Beta Thalassemia	IntechOpen	9.78184E+12	10.5772/intechopen.90288		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
990	33334894	Erythrocytes efficiently utilize exogenous sphingosines for S1P synthesis and export via Mfsd2b.	Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent lipid mediator that exerts its activity via activation of five different G protein-coupled receptors, designated as S1P1-5. This potent lipid mediator is synthesized from the sphingosine precursor by two sphingosine kinases (SphK1 and 2) and must be exported to exert extracellular signaling functions. We recently identified Mfsd2b as the S1P transporter in the hematopoietic system. However, the sources of sphingosine for S1P synthesis and the transport mechanism of Mfsd2b in erythrocytes remain to be determined. Here, we show that erythrocytes efficiently take up exogenous sphingosine and that a de novo synthesis pathway in part provides sphingosines to erythrocytes. The uptake of sphingosine in erythrocytes is facilitated by the activity of SphK1. By converting sphingosine into S1P, SphK1 indirectly increases the influx of sphingosine, a process that is irreversible in erythrocytes. Our results explain for the abnormally high amount of sphingosine accumulation in Mfsd2b knockout erythrocytes. Furthermore, we show that Mfsd2b utilizes a proton gradient to facilitate the release of S1P. The negatively charged residues D95 and T157 are essential for Mfsd2b transport activity. Of interest, we also discovered an S1P analog that inhibits S1P export from erythrocytes, providing evidence that sphingosine analogs can be used to inhibit S1P export by Mfsd2b. Collectively, our results highlight that erythrocytes are efficient in sphingosine uptake for S1P production and the release of S1P is dependent on Mfsd2b functions.	eng	100201		The Journal of biological chemistry	296		2021			D000818;D001692;D053898;D004912/Q000378;D008246/Q000378;D008565/Q000378;D051379;D008810;D008958;D013110/Q000031;D013110/Q000378	Animals;Biological Transport;Biosynthetic Pathways;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Lysophospholipids/metabolism;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Models, Molecular;Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives;Sphingosine/metabolism	Nguyen TQ;Vu TM;Tukijan F;Muralidharan S;Foo JC;Li Chin JF;Hasan Z;Torta F;Nguyen LN	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
991	34619142	Red blood cell triglycerides-a unique pool that incorporates plasma-free fatty acids and relates to metabolic health.	Most research into red blood cell (RBC) lipids focuses on membrane phospholipids and their relationships to metabolic conditions and diet. Triglycerides (TGs) exist in most cells; the TG-fatty acids serve as readily available fuel for oxidative phosphorylation. Because RBCs lack mitochondria, they would not be expected to store fatty acids in TG. We followed up on a previous in vitro study that found FFA can be incorporated into RBC-TG by testing whether intravenously infused [U-<sup>13</sup>C]palmitate could be detected in RBC-TG. We also quantified RBC-TG fatty acid concentrations and profiles as they relate to plasma FFA and lipid concentrations. We found that 1) RBC-TG concentrations measured by glycerol and LC/MS were correlated (r = 0.77; P < 0.001) and averaged <50 nmol/ml RBC; 2) RBC-TG concentrations were stable over 18 h; 3) [U-<sup>13</sup>C]palmitate was detectable in RBC-TG from half the participants; 4) RBC-TGs were enriched in saturated fatty acids and depleted in unsaturated fatty acid compared with plasma FFA and previously reported RBC membrane phospholipids; 5) RBC-TG fatty acid profiles differed significantly between obese and nonobese adults; 6) weight loss altered the RBC-TG fatty acid profile in the obese group; and 7) the RBC-TG fatty acid composition correlated with plasma lipid concentrations. This is the first report showing that plasma FFA contributes to RBC-TG in vivo, in humans, and that the RBC-TG fatty acid profile is related to metabolic health. The storage of saturated fatty acids in RBC-TG stands in stark contrast to the highly unsaturated profile reported in RBC membrane phospholipids.	eng	100131		Journal of lipid research	62		2021			D000328;D004912/Q000737;D005230/Q000378;D005260;D064368;D006801;D008297;D014280/Q000737;D014280/Q000378	Adult;Erythrocytes/chemistry;Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/metabolism;Female;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Male;Triglycerides/chemistry;Triglycerides/metabolism	Song Y;Jensen MD	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;Red blood cell	True
992	34938201	Redox Properties of Human Erythrocytes Are Adapted for Vitamin C Recycling.	Ascorbic acid (AA; or vitamin C) is an important physiological antioxidant and radical scavenger. Some mammalian species, including <i>homo sapiens</i>, have lost the ability to synthetize AA and depend on its nutritional uptake. Erythrocytes from AA-auxotroph mammals express high amounts of the glucose transporter GLUT1. This isoform enables rapid uptake of glucose as well as dehydroascorbate (DHA), the fully oxidized form of AA. Here, we explored the effects of DHA uptake on the redox metabolism of human erythrocytes. DHA uptake enhanced plasma membrane electron transport (PMET) activity. This process is mediated by DCytb, a membrane bound cytochrome catalyzing extracellular reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> and ascorbate free radical (AFR), the first oxidized form of AA. DHA uptake also decreased cellular radical oxygen species (ROS) levels. Both effects were massively enhanced in the presence of physiological glucose concentrations. Reduction of DHA to AA largely depleted intracellular glutathione (GSH) and induced the efflux of its oxidized form, GSSG. GSSG efflux could be inhibited by MK-571 (<i>IC</i> <sub>50</sub> = 5 μM), indicating involvement of multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP1/4). DHA-dependent GSH depletion and GSSG efflux were completely rescued in the presence of 5 mM glucose and, partially, by 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG), respectively. These findings indicate that human erythrocytes are physiologically adapted to recycle AA both intracellularly <i>via</i> GLUT1-mediated DHA uptake and reduction and extracellularly <i>via</i> DCytb-mediated AFR reduction. We discuss the possibility that this improved erythrocyte-mediated AA recycling was a prerequisite for the emergence of AA auxotrophy which independently occurred at least twice during mammalian evolution.	eng	767439		Frontiers in physiology	12		2021					Eigenschink M;Savran D;Zitterer CP;Granitzer S;Fritz M;Baron DM;Müllner EW;Salzer U	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True

994	32597195	Red Blood Cell-Mediated S-Nitrosohemoglobin-Dependent Vasodilation: Lessons Learned from a β-Globin Cys93 Knock-In Mouse.	"<b><i>Significance:</i></b> Red blood cell (RBC)-mediated vasodilation plays an important role in oxygen delivery. This occurs through hemoglobin actions, at least in significant part, to convert heme-bound nitric oxide (NO) (in tense [T]/deoxygenated-state hemoglobin) into vasodilator S-nitrosothiol (SNO) (in relaxed [R]/oxygenated-state hemoglobin), convey SNO through the bloodstream, and release it into tissues to increase blood flow. The coupling of hemoglobin R/T state allostery, both to NO conversion into SNO and to SNO release (along with oxygen), under hypoxia supports the model of a three-gas respiratory cycle (O<sub>2</sub>/NO/CO<sub>2</sub>). <b><i>Recent Advances:</i></b> Oxygenation of tissues is dependent on a single, strictly conserved Cys residue in hemoglobin (βCys93). Hemoglobin couples SNO formation/release at βCys93 to O<sub>2</sub> binding/release at hemes (""thermodynamic linkage""). Mice bearing βCys93Ala hemoglobin that is unable to generate SNO-βCys93 establish that SNO-hemoglobin is important for R/T allostery-regulated vasodilation by RBCs that couple blood flow to tissue oxygenation. <b><i>Critical Issues:</i></b> The model for RBC-mediated vasodilation originally proposed by Stamler <i>et al.</i> in 1996 has been largely validated: SNO-βCys93 forms <i>in vivo</i>, dilates blood vessels, and is hypoxia-regulated, and RBCs actuate vasodilation proportionate to hypoxia. Numerous compensations in βCys93Ala animals to alleviate tissue hypoxia (discussed herein) are predicted to preserve vasodilatory responses of RBCs but impair linkage to R/T transition in hemoglobin. This is borne out by loss of responsivity of mutant RBCs to oxygen, impaired blood flow responses to hypoxia, and tissue ischemia in βCys93-mutant animals. <b><i>Future Directions:</i></b> SNO-hemoglobin mediates hypoxic vasodilation in the respiratory cycle. This fundamental physiology promises new insights in vascular diseases and blood disorders."	eng	936	961	Antioxidants & redox signaling	34	12	2021	Apr	20	D000818;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000473;D055879;D006454/Q000235;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D051379;D009569/Q000235;D010100/Q000378;D026403/Q000627;D014664/Q000235;D055544/Q000235;D055544/Q000378	Animals;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/pathology;Gene Knock-In Techniques;Hemoglobins/genetics;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Mice;Nitric Oxide/genetics;Oxygen/metabolism;S-Nitrosothiols/therapeutic use;Vasodilation/genetics;beta-Globins/genetics;beta-Globins/metabolism	Premont RT;Reynolds JD;Zhang R;Stamler JS	Journal, Articles					10.1089/ars.2020.8153		RBC;Erythrocyte;Red Blood Cell;Red blood cell	True

996	34669510	Cell physiology and molecular mechanism of anion transport by erythrocyte band 3/AE1.	The major transmembrane protein of the red blood cell, known as band 3, AE1, and SLC4A1, has two main functions: <i>1</i>) catalysis of Cl<sup>-</sup>/[Formula: see text] exchange, one of the steps in CO<sub>2</sub> excretion, and <i>2</i>) anchoring the membrane skeleton. This review summarizes the 150-year history of research on red cell anion transport and band 3 as an experimental system for studying membrane protein structure and ion transport mechanisms. Important early findings were that red cell Cl<sup>-</sup> transport is a tightly coupled 1:1 exchange and band 3 is labeled by stilbenesulfonate derivatives that inhibit anion transport. Biochemical studies showed that the protein is dimeric or tetrameric (paired dimers) and that there is one stilbenedisulfonate binding site per subunit of the dimer. Transport kinetics and inhibitor characteristics supported the idea that the transporter acts by an alternating access mechanism with intrinsic asymmetry. The sequence of band 3 cDNA provided a framework for detailed study of protein topology and amino acid residues important for transport. The identification of genetic variants produced insights into the roles of band 3 in red cell abnormalities and distal renal tubular acidosis. The publication of the membrane domain crystal structure made it possible to propose concrete molecular models of transport. Future research directions include improving our understanding of the transport mechanism at the molecular level and of the integrative relationships among band 3, hemoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and gradients (both transmembrane and subcellular) of [Formula: see text], Cl<sup>-</sup>, O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, pH, and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites during pulmonary and systemic capillary gas exchange.	eng	C1028	C1059	American journal of physiology.

Only ABCG2 and SLC29A1 encode blood group systems, JR and AUG, respectively. We propose red cells as an ex vivo model system to study the effect of heritable variants in genes encoding the transport proteins on the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Altered pharmacodynamics in red cells could also cause adverse reactions, such as haemolysis, hitherto unexplained by other mechanisms.	eng	141	154	Vox sanguinis	116	2	2021	Feb		D000070997/Q000235;D018528/Q000235;D001789/Q000235;D000073840/Q000235;D019005/Q000235;D000072470/Q000235;D004851/Q000235;D033721/Q000235;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D008565/Q000235;D026901/Q000235;D027501/Q000235;D027425/Q000235;D009363/Q000235;D010597;D011110;D058978/Q000235;D027981/Q000235	ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2/genetics;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics;Blood Group Antigens/genetics;Copper-Transporting ATPases/genetics;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/genetics;Cytochrome P450 Family 4/genetics;Epoxide Hydrolases/genetics;Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/genetics;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Membrane Proteins/genetics;Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics;Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters/genetics;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics;Neoplasm Proteins/genetics;Pharmacogenetics;Polymorphism, Genetic;Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/genetics;Symporters/genetics	Flegel WA;Srivastava K;Sissung TM;Goldspiel BR;Figg WD	Journal, Articles					10.1111/vox.12999		Erythrocyte;red cell	True

999	33310680	Differences in erythrocyte phospholipid membrane long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and the prevalence of fatty acid desaturase genotype among African Americans and European Americans.	Numerous studies have reported an association between genetic variants in fatty acid desaturases (FADS1 and FADS2) and plasma or erythrocyte long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels. Increased levels of n-6 PUFAs have been associated with inflammation and several chronic diseases, including diabetes and cancer. We hypothesized that genetic variants of FADS that more efficiently convert precursor n-6 PUFA to arachidonic acid (AA) may explain the higher burden of chronic diseases observed in African Americans. To test this hypothesis, we measured the level of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs in erythrocyte membrane phospholipids and genotyped the rs174537 FADS variants associated with higher AA conversion among African American and European American populations. We included data from 1,733 individuals who participated in the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study, a large colonoscopy-based case-control study. Erythrocyte membrane PUFA percentages were measured using gas chromatography. Generalized linear models were used to estimate association of race and genotype on erythrocyte phospholipid membrane PUFA levels while controlling for self-reported dietary intake. We found that African Americans have higher levels of AA and a higher prevalence of GG allele compared to whites, 81% vs 43%, respectively. Homozygous GG genotype was negatively associated with precursor PUFAs (linoleic [LA], di-homo-γ-linolenic [DGLA]), positively associated with both product PUFA (AA, docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]), product to precursor ratio (AA to DGLA), an indirect measure of FADs efficiency and increased urinary isoprostane F2 (F2-IsoP) and isoprostane F3 (F3-IsoP), markers of oxidative stress. Increased consumption of n-6 PUFA and LA resulting in increased AA and subsequent inflammation may be fueling increased prevalence of chronic diseases especially in African descent.	eng	102216		Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids	164		2021	Jan		D001741/Q000235;D000090943;D004910/Q000235;D004910/Q000378;D044943/Q000235;D044943/Q000378;D005231/Q000235;D005231/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D008297;D008875;D010743/Q000235;D010743/Q000378;D020641;D044465/Q000235	Black or African American/genetics;Delta-5 Fatty Acid Desaturase;Erythrocyte Membrane/genetics;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Fatty Acid Desaturases/genetics;Fatty Acid Desaturases/metabolism;Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/genetics;Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/metabolism;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Phospholipids/genetics;Phospholipids/metabolism;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;White People/genetics	Rifkin SB;Shrubsole MJ;Cai Q;Smalley WE;Ness RM;Swift LL;Milne G;Zheng W;Murff HJ	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.plefa.2020.102216		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1000	33441957	Erythrocyte sphingosine kinase regulates intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum.	The sphingolipid pool is key regulator of vital cellular functions in Plasmodium falciparum a causative agent for deadly malaria. Erythrocytes, the host for asexual stage of Plasmodium, are major reservoir for Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Erythrocyte possesses Sphingosine kinase (SphK) that catalyzed its biosynthesis from sphingosine (Sph). Since, Plasmodium lacks SphK homologous protein it can be envisaged that it co-opts sphingolipids from both intraerythrocytic as well as extracellular pools for its growth and development. Herein, by sphingosine-NBD probing, we report that infected erythrocytes imports Sph from extracellular pool, which is converted to S1P and thereby taken by P. falciparum. Next, by targeting of the SphK through specific inhibitor N,N-Dimethylsphingosine DMS, we show a reduction in erythrocyte endogenous S1P pool and SphK-phosphorylation that led to inhibition in growth and development of ring stage P. falciparum. Owing to the role of S1P in erythrocyte glycolysis we analyzed uptake of NBD-Glucose and production of lactate in DMS treated and untreated plasmodium. DMS treatment led to decreased glycolysis in Plasmodium. Interestingly the host free Plasmodium did not show any effect on glycolysis with DMS treatment indicating its host-mediated effect. Further to understand the in-vivo anti-plasmodial effects of exogenous and endogenous erythrocyte S1P level, Sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (S1PL) inhibitor (THI), S1P and SphK-1 inhibitor (DMS), were used in Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) mice model. DMS treatment led to reduction of endogenous S1P conferred significant decrease in parasite load, whereas the plasma level S1P modulated by (THI) and exogenous S1P have no effect on growth of Plasmodium. This suggested erythrocyte endogenous S1P pool is important for Plasmodium growth whereas the plasma level S1P has no effect. Altogether, this study provides insight on cellular processes regulated by S1P in P. falciparum and highlights the novel mechanistically distinct molecular target i.e. SphK-1.	eng	1257		Scientific reports	11	1	2021	Jan	13	D004912/Q000201;D004912/Q000469;D006801;D008246/Q000378;D017853/Q000378;D010963/Q000254;D013110/Q000031;D013110/Q000378	Erythrocytes/enzymology;Erythrocytes/parasitology;Humans;Lysophospholipids/metabolism;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism;Plasmodium falciparum/growth & development;Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives;Sphingosine/metabolism	Sah RK;Pati S;Saini M;Singh S	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True
1001	33477427	Acute Cycling Exercise Induces Changes in Red Blood Cell Deformability and Membrane Lipid Remodeling.	Here we describe the effects of a controlled, 30 min, high-intensity cycling test on blood rheology and the metabolic profiles of red blood cells (RBCs) and plasma from well-trained males. RBCs demonstrated decreased deformability and trended toward increased generation of microparticles after the test. Meanwhile, metabolomics and lipidomics highlighted oxidative stress and activation of membrane lipid remodeling mechanisms in order to cope with altered properties of circulation resulting from physical exertion during the cycling test. Of note, intermediates from coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis for conjugation to fatty acyl chains, in parallel with reversible conversion of carnitine and acylcarnitines, emerged as metabolites that significantly correlate with RBC deformability and the generation of microparticles during exercise. Taken together, we propose that RBC membrane remodeling and repair plays an active role in the physiologic response to exercise by altering RBC properties.	eng			International journal of molecular sciences	22	2	2021	Jan	18	D000328;D004906;D004907/Q000235;D004912/Q000378;D015444/Q000502;D006801;D000081362;D008297;D008563/Q000097;D055432;D010101;D005082/Q000235;D005082/Q000502	Adult;Erythrocyte Count;Erythrocyte Deformability/genetics;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Exercise/physiology;Humans;Lipidomics;Male;Membrane Lipids/blood;Metabolomics;Oxygen Consumption;Physical Exertion/genetics;Physical Exertion/physiology	Nemkov T;Skinner SC;Nader E;Stefanoni D;Robert M;Cendali F;Stauffer E;Cibiel A;Boisson C;Connes P;D'Alessandro A	Journal, Articles							RBC;red blood cell;Erythrocyte;Red Blood Cell	True
1002	34360826	N-Glycomics of Human Erythrocytes.	Glycosylation is a complex post-translational modification that conveys functional diversity to glycoconjugates. Cell surface glycosylation mediates several biological activities such as induction of the intracellular signaling pathway and pathogen recognition. Red blood cell (RBC) membrane N-glycans determine blood type and influence cell lifespan. Although several proteomic studies have been carried out, the glycosylation of RBC membrane proteins has not been systematically investigated. This work aims at exploring the human RBC N-glycome by high-sensitivity MALDI-MS techniques to outline a fingerprint of RBC N-glycans. To this purpose, the MALDI-TOF spectra of healthy subjects harboring different blood groups were acquired. Results showed the predominant occurrence of neutral and sialylated complex N-glycans with bisected N-acetylglucosamine and core- and/or antennary fucosylation. In the higher mass region, these species presented with multiple N-acetyllactosamine repeating units. Amongst the detected glycoforms, the presence of glycans bearing ABO(H) antigens allowed us to define a distinctive spectrum for each blood group. For the first time, advanced glycomic techniques have been applied to a comprehensive exploration of human RBC N-glycosylation, providing a new tool for the early detection of distinct glycome changes associated with disease conditions as well as for understanding the molecular recognition of pathogens.	eng			International journal of molecular sciences	22	15	2021	Jul	28	D001789/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D054794;D006031;D006801;D011134/Q000032;D011499;D040901;D019032	Blood Group Antigens/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycomics;Glycosylation;Humans;Polysaccharides/analysis;Protein Processing, Post-Translational;Proteomics;Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization	Bua RO;Messina A;Sturiale L;Barone R;Garozzo D;Palmigiano A	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;Red blood cell	True

1004	33832207	The Hsp70 chaperone system: distinct roles in erythrocyte formation and maintenance.	Erythropoiesis is a tightly regulated cell differentiation process in which specialized oxygen- and carbon dioxide-carrying red blood cells are generated in vertebrates. Extensive reorganization and depletion of the erythroblast proteome leading to the deterioration of general cellular protein quality control pathways and rapid hemoglobin biogenesis rates could generate misfolded/aggregated proteins and trigger proteotoxic stresses during erythropoiesis. Such cytotoxic conditions could prevent proper cell differentiation resulting in premature apoptosis of erythroblasts (ineffective erythropoiesis). The heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) molecular chaperone system supports a plethora of functions that help maintain cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and promote red blood cell differentiation and survival. Recent findings show that abnormalities in the expression, localization and function of the members of this chaperone system are linked to ineffective erythropoiesis in multiple hematological diseases in humans. In this review, we present latest advances in our understanding of the distinct functions of this chaperone system in differentiating erythroblasts and terminally differentiated mature erythrocytes. We present new insights into the protein repair-only function(s) of the Hsp70 system, perhaps to minimize protein degradation in mature erythrocytes to warrant their optimal function and survival in the vasculature under healthy conditions. The work also discusses the modulatory roles of this chaperone system in a wide range of hematological diseases and the therapeutic gain of targeting Hsp70.	eng	1519	1534	Haematologica	106	6	2021	Jun	01	D000818;D004900;D004912;D004920;D018840;D006801;D018832	Animals;Erythroblasts;Erythrocytes;Erythropoiesis;HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins;Humans;Molecular Chaperones	Mathangasinghe Y;Fauvet B;Jane SM;Goloubinoff P;Nillegoda NB	Journal, Articles					10.3324/haematol.2019.233056		Erythro;Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;erythrocyte	True
1005	33690842	The equilibrative nucleoside transporter ENT1 is critical for nucleotide homeostasis and optimal erythropoiesis.	The tight regulation of intracellular nucleotides is critical for the self-renewal and lineage specification of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Nucleosides are major metabolite precursors for nucleotide biosynthesis and their availability in HSCs is dependent on their transport through specific membrane transporters. However, the role of nucleoside transporters in the differentiation of HSCs to the erythroid lineage and in red cell biology remains to be fully defined. Here, we show that the absence of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT1) in human red blood cells with a rare Augustine-null blood type is associated with macrocytosis, anisopoikilocytosis, an abnormal nucleotide metabolome, and deregulated protein phosphorylation. A specific role for ENT1 in human erythropoiesis was demonstrated by a defective erythropoiesis of human CD34+ progenitors following short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of ENT1. Furthermore, genetic deletion of ENT1 in mice was associated with reduced erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow, anemia, and macrocytosis. Mechanistically, we found that ENT1-mediated adenosine transport is critical for cyclic adenosine monophosphate homeostasis and the regulation of erythroid transcription factors. Notably, genetic investigation of 2 ENT1null individuals demonstrated a compensation by a loss-of-function variant in the ABCC4 cyclic nucleotide exporter. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of ABCC4 in Ent1-/- mice rescued erythropoiesis. Overall, our results highlight the importance of ENT1-mediated nucleotide metabolism in erythropoiesis.	eng	3548	3562	Blood	137	25	2021	Jun	24	D000249/Q000378;D000818;D033721/Q000235;D033721/Q000378;D004920;D006412/Q000378;D006706;D006801;D051379;D018345	Adenosine Monophosphate/metabolism;Animals;Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/genetics;Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/metabolism;Erythropoiesis;Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism;Homeostasis;Humans;Mice;Mice, Knockout	Mikdar M;González-Menéndez P;Cai X;Zhang Y;Serra M;Dembele AK;Boschat AC;Sanquer S;Chhuon C;Guerrera IC;Sitbon M;Hermine O;Colin Y;Le Van Kim C;Kinet S;Mohandas N;Xia Y;Peyrard T;Taylor N;Azouzi S	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood.2020007281		Erythro;red blood cell;red cell;erythro	True
1006	33690597	PIEZO1 and the mechanism of the long circulatory longevity of human red blood cells.	Human red blood cells (RBCs) have a circulatory lifespan of about four months. Under constant oxidative and mechanical stress, but devoid of organelles and deprived of biosynthetic capacity for protein renewal, RBCs undergo substantial homeostatic changes, progressive densification followed by late density reversal among others, changes assumed to have been harnessed by evolution to sustain the rheological competence of the RBCs for as long as possible. The unknown mechanisms by which this is achieved are the subject of this investigation. Each RBC traverses capillaries between 1000 and 2000 times per day, roughly one transit per minute. A dedicated Lifespan model of RBC homeostasis was developed as an extension of the RCM introduced in the previous paper to explore the cumulative patterns predicted for repetitive capillary transits over a standardized lifespan period of 120 days, using experimental data to constrain the range of acceptable model outcomes. Capillary transits were simulated by periods of elevated cell/medium volume ratios and by transient deformation-induced permeability changes attributed to PIEZO1 channel mediation as outlined in the previous paper. The first unexpected finding was that quantal density changes generated during single capillary transits cease accumulating after a few days and cannot account for the observed progressive densification of RBCs on their own, thus ruling out the quantal hypothesis. The second unexpected finding was that the documented patterns of RBC densification and late reversal could only be emulated by the implementation of a strict time-course of decay in the activities of the calcium and Na/K pumps, suggestive of a selective mechanism enabling the extended longevity of RBCs. The densification pattern over most of the circulatory lifespan was determined by calcium pump decay whereas late density reversal was shaped by the pattern of Na/K pump decay. A third finding was that both quantal changes and pump-decay regimes were necessary to account for the documented lifespan pattern, neither sufficient on their own. A fourth new finding revealed that RBCs exposed to levels of PIEZO1-medited calcium permeation above certain thresholds in the circulation could develop a pattern of early or late hyperdense collapse followed by delayed density reversal. When tested over much reduced lifespan periods the results reproduced the known circulatory fate of irreversible sickle cells, the cell subpopulation responsible for vaso-occlusion and for most of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease. Analysis of the results provided an insightful new understanding of the mechanisms driving the changes in RBC homeostasis during circulatory aging in health and disease.	eng	e1008496		PLoS computational biology	17	3	2021	Mar		D001775;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007473/Q000378	Blood Circulation;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Ion Channels/metabolism	Rogers S;Lew VL	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
1007	33806028	Proteome of Stored RBC Membrane and Vesicles from Heterozygous Beta Thalassemia Donors.	Genetic characteristics of blood donors may impact the storability of blood products. Despite higher basal stress, red blood cells (RBCs) from eligible donors that are heterozygous for beta-thalassemia traits (βThal<sup>+</sup>) possess a differential nitrogen-related metabolism, and cope better with storage stress compared to the control. Nevertheless, not much is known about how storage impacts the proteome of membrane and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in βThal<sup>+</sup>. For this purpose, RBC units from twelve βThal<sup>+</sup> donors were studied through proteomics, immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and functional ELISA assays, versus units from sex- and aged-matched controls. βThal<sup>+</sup> RBCs exhibited less irreversible shape modifications. Their membrane proteome was characterized by different levels of structural, lipid raft, transport, chaperoning, redox, and enzyme components. The most prominent findings include the upregulation of myosin proteoforms, arginase-1, heat shock proteins, and protein kinases, but the downregulation of nitrogen-related transporters. The unique membrane proteome was also mirrored, in part, to that of βThal<sup>+</sup> EVs. Network analysis revealed interesting connections of membrane vesiculation with storage and stress hemolysis, along with proteome control modulators of the RBC membrane. Our findings, which are in line with the mild but consistent oxidative stress these cells experience in vivo, provide insight into the physiology and aging of stored βThal<sup>+</sup> RBCs.	eng			International journal of molecular sciences	22	7	2021	Mar	25	D001782;D001793/Q000379;D004797;D004910/Q000378;D000067128/Q000378;D006461;D006579;D006801;D016018;D021962/Q000378;D010084;D018384;D020543;D040901;D013048/Q000379;D017086/Q000097;D017086/Q000235	Blood Donors;Blood Preservation/methods;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Extracellular Vesicles/metabolism;Hemolysis;Heterozygote;Humans;Least-Squares Analysis;Membrane Microdomains/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Proteome;Proteomics;Specimen Handling/methods;beta-Thalassemia/blood;beta-Thalassemia/genetics	Tzounakas VL;Anastasiadi AT;Dzieciatkowska M;Karadimas DG;Stamoulis K;Papassideri IS;Hansen KC;D'Alessandro A;Kriebardis AG;Antonelou MH	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
1008	33616868	Identification of characteristic proteins at late-stage erythroid differentiation in vitro.	The production of red blood cells in vitro, which is useful for basic or clinical research, has been improved. Further optimization of culture protocols may facilitate erythroid differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells to red blood cells. However, the details of erythropoiesis, particularly regarding the behaviors of differentiation-related proteins, remain unclear. Here, we performed erythroid differentiation using two independent bone marrow- or cord blood-derived CD34+ cell sources and identified proteins showing reproducible differential expression in all groups. Notably, most of the proteins expressed at the early stage were downregulated during erythroid differentiation. However, seven proteins showed upregulated expression in both bone marrow cells and cord blood cells. These proteins included alpha-synuclein and selenium-binding protein 1, the roles of which have not been clarified in erythropoiesis. There is a possibility that these factors contribute to erythroid differentiation as they maintained a high expression level.

1010	34273539	Human and rodent red blood cells do not demonstrate xanthine oxidase activity or XO-catalyzed nitrite reduction to NO.	A number of molybdopterin enzymes, including xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), aldehyde oxidase (AO), sulfite oxidase (SO), and mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC), have been identified as nitrate and nitrite reductases. Of these enzymes, XOR has been the most extensively studied and reported to be a substantive source of nitric oxide (NO) under inflammatory/hypoxic conditions that limit the catalytic activity of the canonical NOS pathway. It has also been postulated that XOR nitrite reductase activity extends to red blood cell (RBCs) membranes where it has been immunohistochemically identified. These findings, when combined with countervailing reports of XOR activity in RBCs, incentivized our current study to critically evaluate XOR protein abundance/enzymatic activity in/on RBCs from human, mouse, and rat sources. Using various protein concentrations of RBC homogenates for both human and rodent samples, neither XOR protein nor enzymatic activity (xanthine → uric acid) was detectable. In addition, potential loading of RBC-associated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) by exposing RBC preparations to purified XO before washing did not solicit detectable enzymatic activity (xanthine → uric acid) or alter NO generation profiles. To ensure these observations extended to absence of XOR-mediated contributions to overall RBC-associated nitrite reduction, we examined the nitrite reductase activity of washed and lysed RBC preparations via enhanced chemiluminescence in the presence or absence of the XOR-specific inhibitor febuxostat (Uloric®). Neither addition of inhibitor nor the presence of the XOR substrate xanthine significantly altered the rates of nitrite reduction to NO by RBC preparations from either human or rodent sources confirming the absence of XO enzymatic activity. Furthermore, examination of the influence of the age (young cells vs. old cells) of human RBCs on XO activity also failed to demonstrate detectable XO protein. Combined, these data suggest: 1) that XO does not contribute to nitrite reduction in/on human and rodent erythrocytes, 2) care should be taken to validate immuno-detectable XO by demonstrating enzymatic activity, and 3) XO does not associate with human erythrocytic glycosaminoglycans or participate in nonspecific binding.	eng	84	88	Free radical biology & medicine	174		2021	Oct		D000818;D002384;D004912;D006801;D051379;D009569;D009573;D051381;D012377;D014968;D014969	Animals;Catalysis;Erythrocytes;Humans;Mice;Nitric Oxide;Nitrites;Rats;Rodentia;Xanthine Dehydrogenase;Xanthine Oxidase	Lewis SE;Rosencrance CB;De Vallance E;Giromini A;Williams XM;Oh JY;Schmidt H;Straub AC;Chantler PD;Patel RP;Kelley EE	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2021.07.012		Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;erythrocyte;RBC	True
1011	34298465	Red blood cells contain enzymatically active GPx4 whose abundance anticorrelates with hemolysis during blood bank storage.	The antioxidant function of the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPx4) is vital for the homeostasis of many cell types, from neoplastic cells to normal erythroid precursors. However, some functional proteins in erythroid precursors are lost during the development of red blood cells (RBCs); whether GPx4 is maintained as an active enzyme in mature RBCs has remained unclear. Our meta-analyses of existing RBC proteomics and metabolomics studies revealed the abundance of GPx4 to be correlated with lipid-anchored proteins. In addition, GPx4 anti-correlated with lyso-phospholipids and complement system proteins, further supporting the presence of active GPx4 in mature RBCs. To test the potential biological relevance of GPx4 in mature RBCs, we correlated the rate of hemolysis of human RBCs during storage with the abundance of GPx4 and other heritable RBC proteins. Of the molecules that anti-correlated with the rate of hemolysis of RBCs, proteins that mediate the cellular response to hydroperoxides, including GPx4, have the greatest enrichment. Western blotting further confirmed the presence of GPx4 antigenic protein in RBCs. Using an assay optimized to measure the activity of GPx4 in RBCs, we found GPx4 to be an active enzyme in mature RBCs, suggesting that GPx4 protects RBCs from hemolysis during blood bank storage.	eng	102073		Redox biology	46		2021	Oct		D001771;D001793;D004912;D005979/Q000235;D006461;D006801	Blood Banks;Blood Preservation;Erythrocytes;Glutathione Peroxidase/genetics;Hemolysis;Humans	Stolwijk JM;Stefely JA;Veling MT;van 't Erve TJ;Wagner BA;Raife TJ;Buettner GR	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythro;Red blood cell;red blood cell;RBC	True
1012	34559024	Human erythrocytes, nuclear factor kappaB (NFκB) and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) - from non-genomic to genomic research.	Enucleated mature human erythrocytes possess NFĸBs and their upstream kinases. There is a negative correlation between eryptosis (cell death of erythrocytes) and the amount of NFĸB subunits p50 and Rel A (p65). This finding is based on the fact that young erythrocytes have the highest levels of NFĸBs and the lowest eryptosis rate, while in old erythrocytes the opposite ratio prevails. Human erythrocytes (hRBCs) effectively control the homeostasis of the cell membrane permeable anti-inflammatory signal molecule hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). They endogenously produce H<sub>2</sub>S via both non-enzymic (glutathione-dependent) and enzymic processes (mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase-dependent). They uptake H<sub>2</sub>S from diverse tissues and very effectively degrade H<sub>2</sub>S via methemoglobin (Hb-Fe<sup>3+</sup>)-catalyzed oxidation. Interestingly, a reciprocal correlation exists between the intensity of inflammatory diseases and endogenous levels of H<sub>2</sub>S. H<sub>2</sub>S deficiency has been observed in patients with diabetes, psoriasis, obesity, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Furthermore, endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S deficiency results in impaired renal erythropoietin (EPO) production and EPO-dependent erythropoiesis. In general we can say: dynamic reciprocal interaction between tumor suppressor and oncoproteins, orchestrated and sequential activation of pro-inflammatory NFĸB heterodimers (RelA-p50) and the anti-inflammatory NFĸB-p50 homodimers for optimal inflammation response, appropriate generation, subsequent degradation of H<sub>2</sub>S etc., are prerequisites for a functioning cell and organism. Diseases arise when the fragile balance between different signaling pathways that keep each other in check is permanently disturbed. This work deals with the intact anti-inflammatory hRBCs and their role as guarantors to maintain the redox status in the physiological range, a basis for general health and well-being.	eng	2091	2101	Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)	20	20	2021	Oct		D004912/Q000378;D006801;D006862/Q000378;D007668/Q000378;D016328/Q000378;D015398	Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen Sulfide/metabolism;Kidney/metabolism;NF-kappa B/metabolism;Signal Transduction	Ghashghaeinia M;Mrowietz U	Journal, Articles					10.1080/15384101.2021.1972557		RBC;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte;erythro	True

Many studies have documented that erythrocytes can bind hormones, and possible interactions have been reported. Erythrocytes are responsive to signaling initiated after binding of epinephrine, norepinephrine, estrogen, progesterone, thyroid hormones, parathyroid hormone, and angiotensin. Signaling results in regulation of cellular metabolism and membrane fluidity. In addition, erythrocytes are circulating pools for dopamine, thyroid hormones, cortisol, and aldosterone. Erythrocyte function and structure are regulated by endocrine signals, while erythrocytes are important constituents for the transport of hormones in the body.	eng	489	492	Maedica	16	3	2021	Sep				Papadopoulos C;Tentes I;Anagnostopoulos K	Journal, Articles					10.26574/maedica.2020.16.3.489		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1014	34406011	Quantification of the Endogenous Adduction Level on Hemoglobin and Correlation with Albumin Adduction <i>via</i> Proteomics: Multiple Exposure Markers of Catechol Estrogen.	Catechol estrogens (CEs) are genotoxic metabolites whose detection is challenging due to their low concentrations and high variability in the blood. By intact protein and free CE measurement of the spiked hemolysate, endogenous CEs were revealed to mainly (>99%) exist as hemoglobin (Hb) adducts in red blood cells. In order to detect endogenous CE-Hb adducts, we developed a two-step method that involved protein precipitation and solid phase extraction to purify Hb from red blood cells, and the method was coupled with proteomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Using bottom-up proteomics and standard additions, we identified C93 and C112 of Hb-β as the main adduction sites of Hb, and this accounted for CE-induced oxidization of adducted peptides by sample preparation. The non-adducted, adducted, and oxidized tryptic peptides that covered the same Hb-β sequences were targeted by parallel reaction monitoring to determine the adduction level in red blood cells. A quantification limit (S/N < 8) below the endogenous CE-Hb adduction level with relative standard errors that ranged from 5 to 22% was achieved and applied to clinical samples. The human serum albumin (HSA) adduction levels from the same patient were also determined using a previously developed method (<i>Anal. Chem.</i><b>2019,</b><i>91,</i> 15922-15931). A positive correlation (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.673) between the CE-HSA and CE-Hb adduction level was obtained from all clinical samples, and both levels were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.005) higher for patients with breast cancer compared to healthy controls. However, double indexes derived from the red blood cell and the serum, respectively, provide higher precision and confidence in predicting cancer risk than the single index. This study reported an efficient sample preparation for proteomics-based Hb adducts and revealed the potential of using multiple blood proteins for developing more reliable and specific markers based on protein adductomics.	eng	4248	4257	Journal of proteome research	20	9	2021	Sep	03	D002853;D002393;D006454;D006801;D040901;D000075462	Chromatography, Liquid;Estrogens, Catechol;Hemoglobins;Humans;Proteomics;Serum Albumin, Human	Jen HH;Kafeenah H;Chang TY;Lin YM;Shan YS;Wu CH;Chen SH	Journal, Articles					10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00097		red blood cell	True
1015	34564533	Red Blood Cell Proteasome in Beta-Thalassemia Trait: Topology of Activity and Networking in Blood Bank Conditions.	"Proteasomes are multi-catalytic complexes with important roles in protein control. Their activity in stored red blood cells (RBCs) is affected by both storage time and the donor's characteristics. However, apart from their abundancy in the membrane proteome, not much is known about their topology, activity, and networking during the storage of RBCs from beta-thalassemia trait donors (βThal<sup>+</sup>). For this purpose, RBC units from fourteen βThal<sup>+</sup> donors were fractionated and studied for proteasome activity distribution and interactome through fluorometric and correlation analyses against units of sex- and aged-matched controls. In all the samples examined, we observed a time-dependent translocation and/or activation of the proteasome in the membrane and a tight connection of activity with the oxidative burden of cells. Proteasomes were more active in the βThal<sup>+</sup> membranes and supernatants, while the early storage networking of 20S core particles and activities showed a higher degree of connectivity with chaperones, calpains, and peroxiredoxins, which were nonetheless present in all interactomes. Moreover, the βThal<sup>+</sup> interactomes were specially enriched in kinases, metabolic enzymes, and proteins differentially expressed in βThal<sup>+</sup> membrane, including arginase-1, piezo-1, and phospholipid scramblase. Overall, it seems that βThal<sup>+</sup> erythrocytes maintain a considerable ""proteo-vigilance"" during storage, which is closely connected to their distinct antioxidant dynamics and membrane protein profile."	eng			Membranes	11	9	2021	Sep	17			Anastasiadi AT;Tzounakas VL;Arvaniti VZ;Dzieciatkowska M;Stamoulis K;Lekka ME;Papassideri IS;D'Alessandro A;Kriebardis AG;Antonelou MH	Journal, Articles							RBC;red blood cell;Red Blood Cell;erythrocyte	True
1016		Red Blood Cell Metabolism in Patients with Propionic Acidemia	Propionic acidemia (PA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with an estimated incidence of 1:100,000 live births in the general population. Due in part to an insufficient understanding of the disease�s pathophysiology, PA is often associated with complications, and in severe cases can cause coma and death. Despite its association with hematologic disorders, PA�s effect on red blood cell metabolism has not been described. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analyses were performed on RBCs from healthy controls (n = 10) and PKD patients (n = 3). PA was associated with a significant decrease in the steady state level of glycolytic products and the apparent activation of the PPP. The PA samples showed decreases in succinate and increases in the downstream dicarboxylates of the TCA cycle. BCAAs were lowered in the PA samples and C3 carnitine, a direct metabolite of propionic acid, was increased. Trends in the markers of oxidative stress including hypoxanthine, allantoate and spermidine were the opposite of those associated with elevated ROS burden. The alteration of short chain fatty acids, the accumulation of some medium chain and long chain fatty acids, and decreased markers of lipid peroxidation in the PA samples contrasted with previous research. Despite limitations from a small cohort, this study provides the first investigation of RBC metabolism in PA, paving the way for targeted investigations of the critical pathways found to be dysregulated in the context of this disease		142		Separations	8	9	2021	Sep	3			Roy MK, Cendali FI, Ooyama G, Gamboni F, Morton H, D�Alessandro A				MDPI		10.3390/separations8090142		RBC;red blood cell;Red Blood Cell	True
1017	36346805	Proteome expression profiling of red blood cells during the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.	The early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been clinically elucidated, leading to an increased mortality rate in patients with HCC. HCC is a systemic disease related to disorders of blood homeostasis, and the association between red blood cells (RBCs) and HCC tumorigenesis remains elusive. We performed data-independent acquisition proteomic analyses of 72 clinical RBC samples, including HCC (n = 30), liver cirrhosis (LC, n = 17), and healthy controls (n = 25), and characterized the clinical relevance of RBCs and tumorigenesis in HCC. We observed dynamic changes in RBCs during HCC tumorigenesis, and our findings indicate that, based on the protein expression profiles of RBCs, LC is a developmental stage closely approaching HCC. The expression of hemoglobin (HbA and HbF) in peripheral blood dynamically changed during HCC tumorigenesis, suggesting that immature erythroid cells exist in peripheral blood of HCC patients and that erythropoiesis is influenced by the onset of LC. We also identified the disrupted autophagy pathway in RBCs at the onset of LC, which persisted during HCC tumorigenesis. The oxytocin and GnRH pathways were disrupted and first identified during the development of LC into HCC. Significantly differentially expressed SMIM1, ANXA7, HBA1, and HBE1 during tumorigenesis were verified as promising biomarkers for the early diagnosis of HCC using parallel reaction monitoring technology. This study may enhance the understanding of HCC tumorigenesis from a different point of view and aid the early diagnosis of HCC.	eng	e0276904		PloS one	17	11	2022			D006801;D006528/Q000378;D008113/Q000378;D020543;D040901;D014408/Q000378;D008103/Q000175;D002471/Q000473;D004912/Q000378;D008565	Humans;Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/metabolism;Liver Neoplasms/metabolism;Proteome;Proteomics;Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism;Liver Cirrhosis/diagnosis;Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Membrane Proteins	Wang S;Wang G;Lu S;Zhang J;Zhang W;Han Y;Cai X;Zhuang Y;Pu F;Yan X;Tu Z;Wang L;Huang X;Fan B;Wang D;Zhang Z	Journal, Articles							RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;erythro	True
1018	36012667	Mechanosensitive Pannexin 1 Activity Is Modulated by Stomatin in Human Red Blood Cells.	Pannexin 1 (PANX1) was proposed to drive ATP release from red blood cells (RBCs) in response to stress conditions. Stomatin, a membrane protein regulating mechanosensitive channels, has been proposed to modulate PANX1 activity in non-erythroid cells. To determine whether stomatin modulates PANX1 activity in an erythroid context, we have (i) assessed the in situ stomatin-PANX1 interaction in RBCs, (ii) measured PANX1-stimulated activity in RBCs expressing stomatin or from OverHydrated Hereditary Stomatocytosis (OHSt) patients lacking stomatin, and in erythroid K562 cells invalidated for stomatin. Proximity Ligation Assay coupled with flow imaging shows 27.09% and 6.13% positive events in control and OHSt RBCs, respectively. The uptake of dyes 5(6)-Carboxyfluorescein (CF) and TO-PRO-3 was used to evaluate PANX1 activity. RBC permeability for CF is 34% and 11.8% in control and OHSt RBCs, respectively. PANX1 permeability for TO-PRO-3 is 35.72% and 18.42% in K562 stom<sup>+</sup> and stom<sup>-</sup> clones, respectively. These results suggest an interaction between PANX1 and stomatin in human RBCs and show a significant defect in PANX1 activity in the absence of stomatin. Based on these results, we propose that stomatin plays a major role in opening the PANX1 pore by being involved in a caspase-independent lifting of autoinhibition.	eng			International journal of molecular sciences	23	16	2022	Aug	20	D000137/Q000378;D000255/Q000378;D000745;D017630/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D004913/Q000378;D006801;D008565/Q000378;D008661;D009419/Q000378	Acid-Base Imbalance/metabolism;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital;Connexins/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes, Abnormal/metabolism;Humans;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Metabolism, Inborn Errors;Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism	Rougé S;Genetet S;Leal Denis MF;Dussiot M;Schwarzbaum PJ;Ostuni MA;Mouro-Chanteloup I	Journal, Articles							Red Blood Cell;Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;RBC	True
1019	36331552	Magnesium homeostasis in deoxygenated sickle erythrocytes is modulated by endothelin-1 via Na<sup>+</sup> /Mg<sup>2+</sup> exchange.	Painful crises in sickle cell disease (SCD) are associated with increased plasma cytokines levels, including endothelin-1 (ET-1). Reduced red cell magnesium content, mediated in part by increased Na<sup>+</sup> /Mg<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NME) activity, contributes to erythrocyte K<sup>+</sup> loss, dehydration and sickling in SCD. However, the relationship between ET-1 and the NME in SCD has remained unexamined. We observed increased NME activity in sickle red cells incubated in the presence of 500 nM ET-1. Deoxygenation of sickle red cells, in contrast, led to decreased red cell NME activity and cellular dehydration that was reversed by the NME inhibitor, imipramine. Increased NME activity in sickle red cells was significantly blocked by pre-incubation with 100 nM BQ788, a selective blocker of ET-1 type B receptors. These results suggest an important role for ET-1 and for cellular magnesium homeostasis in SCD. Consistent with these results, we observed increased NME activity in sickle red cells of three mouse models of sickle cell disease greater than that in red cells of C57BL/J6 mice. In vivo treatment of BERK sickle transgenic mice with ET-1 receptor antagonists reduced red cell NME activity. Our results suggest that ET-1 receptor blockade may be a promising therapeutic approach to control erythrocyte volume and magnesium homeostasis in SCD and may thus attenuate or retard the associated chronic inflammatory and vascular complications of SCD.	eng	e22638		FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology	36	12	2022	Dec		D051379;D000818;D019332/Q000378;D008274/Q000378;D003681/Q000378;D008810;D004912/Q000378;D000755/Q000188;D000755/Q000378;D012964/Q000378;D006706;D044023/Q000378;D008822	Mice;Animals;Endothelin-1/metabolism;Magnesium/metabolism;Dehydration/metabolism;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Anemia, Sickle Cell/drug therapy;Anemia, Sickle Cell/metabolism;Sodium/metabolism;Homeostasis;Receptor, Endothelin B/metabolism;Mice, Transgenic	Romero JR;Inostroza-Nieves Y;Pulido-Perez P;Lopez P;Wohlgemuth JG;Dlott JS;Snyder LM;Alper SL;Rivera A	Journal, Articles							red cell;Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1020	35573876	Erythrocyte sphingolipid species as biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.	Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the early stage is challenging. Informative biomarkers can be of great value for population-based screening. Metabolomics studies have been used to find potential biomarkers, but commonly used tissue sources can be difficult to obtain. The objective of this study was to determine the potential utility of erythrocyte metabolite profiles in screening for AD. Unlike some commonly-used sources such as cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue, erythrocytes are plentiful and easily accessed. Moreover, erythrocytes are metabolically active, a feature that distinguishes this sample source from other bodily fluids like plasma and urine. In this preliminary pilot study, the erythrocyte metabolomes of 10 histopathologically confirmed AD patients and 10 patients without AD (control (CTRL)) were compared. Whole blood was collected post-mortem and erythrocytes were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Over 750 metabolites were identified in AD and CTRL erythrocytes. Seven were increased in AD while 24 were decreased (<i>P</i><0.05). The majority of the metabolites increased in AD were associated with amino acid metabolism and all of the decreased metabolites were associated with lipid metabolism. Prominent among the potential biomarkers were 10 sphingolipid or sphingolipid-related species that were consistently decreased in AD patients. Sphingolipids have been previously implicated in AD and other neurological conditions. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that erythrocyte sphingolipid concentrations vary widely in normal, healthy adults. Together, these observations suggest that certain erythrocyte lipid phenotypes could be markers of risk for development of AD.	eng	178	185	Journal of pharmaceutical analysis	12	1	2022	Feb				Mill J;Patel V;Okonkwo O;Li L;Raife T	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.jpha.2021.07.005		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1021	35108516	Erythrocyte transglutaminase-2 combats hypoxia and chronic kidney disease by promoting oxygen delivery and carnitine homeostasis.	Due to lack of nuclei and de novo protein synthesis, post-translational modification (PTM) is imperative for erythrocytes to regulate oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) delivery and combat tissue hypoxia. Here, we report that erythrocyte transglutminase-2 (eTG2)-mediated PTM is essential to trigger O<sub>2</sub> delivery by promoting bisphosphoglycerate mutase proteostasis and the Rapoport-Luebering glycolytic shunt for adaptation to hypoxia, in healthy humans ascending to high altitude and in two distinct murine models of hypoxia. In a pathological hypoxia model with chronic kidney disease (CKD), eTG2 is critical to combat renal hypoxia-induced reduction of Slc22a5 transcription and OCNT2 protein levels via HIF-1α-PPARα signaling to maintain carnitine homeostasis. Carnitine supplementation is an effective and safe therapeutic approach to counteract hypertension and progression of CKD by enhancing erythrocyte O<sub>2</sub> delivery. Altogether, we reveal eTG2 as an erythrocyte protein stabilizer orchestrating O<sub>2</sub> delivery and tissue adaptive metabolic reprogramming and identify carnitine-based therapy to mitigate hypoxia and CKD progression.	eng	299	316.e6	Cell metabolism	34	2	2022	Feb	01	D000818;D002331/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D004912/Q000473;D006706;D006801;D000860/Q000378;D051795/Q000378;D051379;D010100/Q000378;D051436/Q000473;D000074058/Q000378;D011503/Q000378	Animals;Carnitine/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Erythrocytes/pathology;Homeostasis;Humans;Hypoxia/metabolism;Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism;Mice;Oxygen/metabolism;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/pathology;Solute Carrier Family 22 Member 5/metabolism;Transglutaminases/metabolism	Xu P;Chen C;Zhang Y;Dzieciatkowska M;Brown BC;Zhang W;Xie T;Abdulmalik O;Song A;Tong C;Qi H;Roach R;Kellems RE;D'Alessandro A;Xia Y	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.cmet.2021.12.019		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1022	35204826	A Potential Citrate Shunt in Erythrocytes of PKAN Patients Caused by Mutations in Pantothenate Kinase 2.	Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in the pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) gene and associated with iron deposition in basal ganglia. Pantothenate kinase isoforms catalyze the first step in coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. Since PANK2 is the only isoform in erythrocytes, these cells are an excellent ex vivo model to study the effect of PANK2 point mutations on expression/stability and activity of the protein as well as on the downstream molecular consequences. PKAN erythrocytes containing the T528M PANK2 mutant had residual enzyme activities but variable PANK2 abundances indicating an impaired regulation of the protein. Patients with G521R/G521R, G521R/G262R, and R264N/L275fs PANK2 mutants had no residual enzyme activity and strongly reduced PANK2 abundance. G521R inactivates the catalytic activity of the enzyme, whereas G262R and the R264N point mutations impair the switch from the inactive to the active conformation of the PANK2 dimer. Metabolites in cytosolic extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and multivariate analytic methods revealing changes in the carboxylate metabolism of erythrocytes from PKAN patients as compared to that of the carrier and healthy control. Assuming low/absent CoA levels in PKAN erythrocytes, changes are consistent with a model of altered citrate channeling where citrate is preferentially converted to α-ketoglutarate and α-hydroxyglutarate instead of being used for de novo acetyl-CoA generation. This finding hints at the importance of carboxylate metabolism in PKAN pathology with potential links to reduced cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA levels in neurons and to aberrant brain iron regulation.	eng			Biomolecules	12	2	2022	Feb	18	D000105;D002951;D019343;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D007501/Q000378;D009154;D019636;D006211/Q000235;D006211/Q000473;D017853;D020033/Q000235	Acetyl Coenzyme A;Citrates;Citric Acid;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Iron/metabolism;Mutation;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration/genetics;Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration/pathology;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor);Protein Isoforms/genetics	Werning M;Dobretzberger V;Brenner M;Müllner EW;Mlynek G;Djinovic-Carugo K;Baron DM;Fragner L;Bischoff AT;Büchner B;Klopstock T;Weckwerth W;Salzer U	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1023	33730845	Beta thalassemia minor is a beneficial determinant of red blood cell storage lesion.	Blood donor genetics and lifestyle affect the quality of red blood cell (RBC) storage. Heterozygotes for beta thalassemia (bThal+) constitute a non-negligible proportion of blood donors in the Mediterranean and other geographical areas. The unique hematological profile of bThal+ could affect the capacity of enduring storage stress, however, the storability of bThal+ RBC is largely unknown. In this study, RBC from 18 bThal+ donors were stored in the cold and profiled for primary (hemolysis) and secondary (phosphatidylserine exposure, potassium leakage, oxidative stress) quality measures, and metabolomics, versus sex- and age-matched controls. The bThal+ units exhibited better levels of storage hemolysis and susceptibility to lysis following osmotic, oxidative and mechanical insults. Moreover, bThal+ RBC had a lower percentage of surface removal signaling, reactive oxygen species and oxidative defects to membrane components at late stages of storage. Lower potassium accumulation and higher uratedependent antioxidant capacity were noted in the bThal+ supernatant. Full metabolomics analyses revealed alterations in purine and arginine pathways at baseline, along with activation of the pentose phosphate pathway and glycolysis upstream to pyruvate kinase in bThal+ RBC. Upon storage, substantial changes were observed in arginine, purine and vitamin B6 metabolism, as well as in the hexosamine pathway. A high degree of glutamate generation in bThal+ RBC was accompanied by low levels of purine oxidation products (IMP, hypoxanthine, allantoin). The bThal mutations impact the metabolism and the susceptibility to hemolysis of stored RBC, suggesting good post-transfusion recovery. However, hemoglobin increment and other clinical outcomes of bThal+ RBC transfusion deserve elucidation by future studies.	eng	112	125	Haematologica	107	1	2022	Jan	01	D001793;D017707;D004912/Q000378;D006461;D006801;D017086/Q000235;D017086/Q000378	Blood Preservation;Erythrocyte Transfusion;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemolysis;Humans;beta-Thalassemia/genetics;beta-Thalassemia/metabolism	Tzounakas VL;Anastasiadi AT;Stefanoni D;Cendali F;Bertolone L;Gamboni F;Dzieciatkowska M;Rousakis P;Vergaki A;Soulakis V;Tsitsilonis OE;Stamoulis K;Papassideri IS;Kriebardis AG;D'Alessandro A;Antonelou MH	Journal, Articles					10.3324/haematol.2020.273946		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True
1024	35835865	Architecture of the human erythrocyte ankyrin-1 complex.	The stability and shape of the erythrocyte membrane is provided by the ankyrin-1 complex, but how it tethers the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton to the lipid bilayer and the nature of its association with the band 3 anion exchanger and the Rhesus glycoproteins remains unknown. Here we present structures of ankyrin-1 complexes purified from human erythrocytes. We reveal the architecture of a core complex of ankyrin-1, the Rhesus proteins RhAG and RhCE, the band 3 anion exchanger, protein 4.2, glycophorin A and glycophorin B. The distinct T-shaped conformation of membrane-bound ankyrin-1 facilitates recognition of RhCE and, unexpectedly, the water channel aquaporin-1. Together, our results uncover the molecular details of ankyrin-1 association with the erythrocyte membrane, and illustrate the mechanism of ankyrin-mediated membrane protein clustering.	eng	706	718	Nature structural & molecular biology	29	7	2022	Jul		D001457/Q000032;D001457/Q000737;D001457/Q000378;D017487/Q000378;D003598/Q000378;D004910/Q000737;D004910/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D013049	Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/analysis;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/chemistry;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Ankyrins/metabolism;Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism;Erythrocyte Membrane/chemistry;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Spectrin	Vallese F;Kim K;Yen LY;Johnston JD;Noble AJ;Calì T;Clarke OB	Journal, Articles					10.1038/s41594-022-00792-w		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1025	35886939	Sphingolipid Catabolism and Glycerophospholipid Levels Are Altered in Erythrocytes and Plasma from Multiple Sclerosis Patients.	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, inflammatory, degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Changes in lipid metabolism have been suggested to play important roles in MS pathophysiology and progression. In this work we analyzed the lipid composition and sphingolipid-catabolizing enzymes in erythrocytes and plasma from MS patients and healthy controls. We observed reduction of sphingomyelin (SM) and elevation of its products-ceramide (CER) and shingosine (SPH). These changes were supported by the detected up-regulation of the activity of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) in MS plasma and alkaline ceramidase (ALCER) in erythrocytes from MS patients. In addition, Western blot analysis showed elevated expression of ASM, but not of ALCER. We also compared the ratios between saturated (SAT), unsaturated (UNSAT) and polyunsaturated fatty acids and suggest, based on the significant differences observed for this ratio, that the UNSAT/SAT values could serve as a marker distinguishing erythrocytes and plasma of MS from controls. In conclusion, the application of lipid analysis in the medical practice would contribute to definition of more precise diagnosis, analysis of disease progression, and evaluation of therapeutic strategies. Based on the molecular changes of blood lipids in neurodegenerative pathologies, including MS, clinical lipidomic analytical approaches could become a promising contemporary tool for personalized medicine.	eng			International journal of molecular sciences	23	14	2022	Jul	08	D055574/Q000378;D002518/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D020404/Q000378;D006801;D009103/Q000378;D013107/Q000378	Alkaline Ceramidase/metabolism;Ceramides/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Glycerophospholipids/metabolism;Humans;Multiple Sclerosis/metabolism;Sphingolipids/metabolism	Momchilova A;Pankov R;Alexandrov A;Markovska T;Pankov S;Krastev P;Staneva G;Vassileva E;Krastev N;Pinkas A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1026	35858567	The protein organization of a red blood cell.	Red blood cells (RBCs) (erythrocytes) are the simplest primary human cells, lacking nuclei and major organelles and instead employing about a thousand proteins to dynamically control cellular function and morphology in response to physiological cues. In this study, we define a canonical RBC proteome and interactome using quantitative mass spectrometry and machine learning. Our data reveal an RBC interactome dominated by protein homeostasis, redox biology, cytoskeletal dynamics, and carbon metabolism. We validate protein complexes through electron microscopy and chemical crosslinking and, with these data, build 3D structural models of the ankyrin/Band 3/Band 4.2 complex that bridges the spectrin cytoskeleton to the RBC membrane. The model suggests spring-like compression of ankyrin may contribute to the characteristic RBC cell shape and flexibility. Taken together, our study provides an in-depth view of the global protein organization of human RBCs and serves as a comprehensive resource for future research.	eng	111103		Cell reports	40	3	2022	Jul	19	D017487/Q000378;D003599/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D020543/Q000378;D013049/Q000378	Ankyrins/metabolism;Cytoskeleton/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Proteome/metabolism;Spectrin/metabolism	Sae-Lee W;McCafferty CL;Verbeke EJ;Havugimana PC;Papoulas O;McWhite CD;Houser JR;Vanuytsel K;Murphy GJ;Drew K;Emili A;Taylor DW;Marcotte EM	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111103		Erythrocyte;Red blood cell;red blood cell;erythrocyte;RBC	True
1027	35705035	Human peroxiredoxin 6 is essential for malaria parasites and provides a host-based drug target.	The uptake and digestion of host hemoglobin by malaria parasites during blood-stage growth leads to significant oxidative damage of membrane lipids. Repair of lipid peroxidation damage is crucial for parasite survival. Here, we demonstrate that Plasmodium falciparum imports a host antioxidant enzyme, peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), during hemoglobin uptake from the red blood cell cytosol. PRDX6 is a lipid-peroxidation repair enzyme with phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) activity. Inhibition of PRDX6 with a PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor, Darapladib, increases lipid-peroxidation damage in the parasite and disrupts transport of hemoglobin-containing vesicles to the food vacuole, causing parasite death. Furthermore, inhibition of PRDX6 synergistically reduces the survival of artemisinin-resistant parasites following co-treatment of parasite cultures with artemisinin and Darapladib. Thus, PRDX6 is a host-derived drug target for development of antimalarial drugs that could help overcome artemisinin resistance.	eng	110923		Cell reports	39	11	2022	Jun	14	D000818;D000962/Q000494;D037621/Q000378;D037621/Q000494;D001547/Q000494;D004351;D006454/Q000378;D006801;D008055;D008288/Q000188;D016778/Q000188;D016778/Q000469;D051379;D010091/Q000494;D054465/Q000276;D054465/Q000378;D010963	Animals;Antimalarials/pharmacology;Artemisinins/metabolism;Artemisinins/pharmacology;Benzaldehydes/pharmacology;Drug Resistance;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Humans;Lipids;Malaria/drug therapy;Malaria, Falciparum/drug therapy;Malaria, Falciparum/parasitology;Mice;Oximes/pharmacology;Peroxiredoxin VI/immunology;Peroxiredoxin VI/metabolism;Plasmodium falciparum	Wagner MP;Formaglio P;Gorgette O;Dziekan JM;Huon C;Berneburg I;Rahlfs S;Barale JC;Feinstein SI;Fisher AB;Ménard D;Bozdech Z;Amino R;Touqui L;Chitnis CE	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110923		red blood cell	True
1028	35624807	Role of Erythrocytes in Nitric Oxide Metabolism and Paracrine Regulation of Endothelial Function.	Emerging studies provide new data shedding some light on the complex and pivotal role of red blood cells (RBCs) in nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and paracrine regulation of endothelial function. NO is involved in the regulation of vasodilatation, platelet aggregation, inflammation, hypoxic adaptation, and oxidative stress. Even though tremendous knowledge about NO metabolism has been collected, the exact RBCs' status still requires evaluation. This paper summarizes the actual knowledge regarding the role of erythrocytes as a mobile depot of amino acids necessary for NO biotransformation. Moreover, the complex regulation of RBCs' translocases is presented with a particular focus on cationic amino acid transporters (CATs) responsible for the NO substrates and derivatives transport. The main part demonstrates the intraerythrocytic metabolism of L-arginine with its regulation by reactive oxygen species and arginase activity. Additionally, the process of nitrite and nitrate turnover was demonstrated to be another stable source of NO, with its reduction by xanthine oxidoreductase or hemoglobin. Additional function of hemoglobin in NO synthesis and its subsequent stabilization in steady intermediates is also discussed. Furthermore, RBCs regulate the vascular tone by releasing ATP, inducing smooth muscle cell relaxation, and decreasing platelet aggregation. Erythrocytes and intraerythrocytic NO metabolism are also responsible for the maintenance of normotension. Hence, RBCs became a promising new therapeutic target in restoring NO homeostasis in cardiovascular disorders.	eng			Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)	11	5	2022	May	11			Gajecki D;Gawryś J;Szahidewicz-Krupska E;Doroszko A	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythro;red blood cell;erythrocyte;RBC	True
1029	36029940	Erythrocyte mitogen-activated protein kinases mediate hemolytic events under osmotic and oxidative stress and in hemolytic diseases.	p38 MAPKs are key regulators of cellular adaptation to various stress stimuli, however, their role in mediating erythrocyte cell death and hemolysis is largely unknown. We hypothesized that activation of erythrocyte p38 MAPK is a common event in the stimulation of hemolysis, and that inhibition of p38 MAPK pathways could mitigate hemolysis in hemoglobinopathies. We exposed human erythrocytes to diamide-induced oxidative stress or to hypoosmotic shock in the presence or absence of p38 MAPK inhibitors (SCIO469, SB203580, CMPD1) and used immunoblotting to determine MAPK activity and to identify possible downstream effectors of p38 MAPK. We also evaluated the impact of p38 MAPK inhibitors on stress-induced hemolysis or hypoxia-induced sickling in erythrocytes from mouse models of sickle cell disease. We found that human erythrocytes express conventional MAPKs (MKK3, p38 MAPK, MAPKAPK2) and identified differential MAPK activation pathways in each stress condition. Specifically, p38 MAPK inhibition in diamide-treated erythrocytes was associated with decreased phosphorylation of Src tyrosine kinases and Band 3 protein. Conversely, hypoosmotic shock induced MAPKAPK2 and RSK2 phosphorylation, which was inhibited by SCIO469 or CMPD1. Relevant to hemoglobinopathies, sickle cell disease was associated with increased erythrocyte MKK3, p38 MAPK, and MAPKAPK2 expression and phosphorylation as compared with erythrocytes from healthy individuals. Furthermore, p38 MAPK inhibition was associated with decreased hemolysis in response to diamide treatments or osmotic shock, and with decreased erythrocyte sickling under experimental hypoxia. These findings provided insights into MAPK-mediated signaling pathways that regulate erythrocyte function and hemolysis in response to extracellular stressors or human diseases.	eng	110450		Cellular signalling	99		2022	Nov		D000755;D000818;D001457/Q000378;D003958;D004789;D004912/Q000378;D006453;D006461;D006801;D000860;D051379;D020929/Q000378;D020928/Q000378;D018384;D010766;D048051/Q000378;D019061/Q000378	Anemia, Sickle Cell;Animals;Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/metabolism;Diamide;Enzyme Activation;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hemoglobinopathies;Hemolysis;Humans;Hypoxia;Mice;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism;Oxidative Stress;Phosphorylation;p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism;src-Family Kinases/metabolism	Hazegh K;Fang F;Kelly K;Sinchar D;Wang L;Zuchelkowski BE;Ufelle AC;Esparza O;Davizon-Castillo P;Page GP;Kanias T	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.cellsig.2022.110450		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1030	35976696	Evidence for low-level translation in human erythrocytes.	It is generally believed that human mature erythrocytes do not possess functional ribosomes and therefore cannot synthesize proteins. However, the absence of translation is not consistent with the long lifespan of mature erythrocytes. They stay viable and functional for about 115 d in the circulatory system. Here, using a highly pure preparation of human mature erythrocytes, we demonstrate the presence of translation by polysome profiling, [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine labeling, and RiboPuromycylation. [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine labeling revealed that the translation in mature erythrocytes is about 10% of that observed in reticulocytes. We could observe polysomes by transmission electron microscopy in these cells. RNA-seq and quantitative real-time PCR performed on polysome fractions of these cells revealed that <i>HBA</i> (α-globin) and <i>HBB</i> (β-globin) transcripts are translated. Using a luciferase-based reporter assay and mutational studies, we show that the sequence of the 5' untranslated region is crucial for the translation of these transcripts. Furthermore, mature erythrocytes showed reduced expression of globin proteins (α- and β-) when treated with translation inhibitors. Overall, we provide multiple lines of evidence for translation of globin mRNAs in human mature erythrocytes.	eng	br21		Molecular biology of the cell	33	12	2022	Oct	01	D020121;D004912/Q000378;D006801;D008715/Q000378;D011132/Q000378;D014176;D055542/Q000378;D055544/Q000235;D055544/Q000378	5' Untranslated Regions;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Humans;Methionine/metabolism;Polyribosomes/metabolism;Protein Biosynthesis;alpha-Globins/metabolism;beta-Globins/genetics;beta-Globins/metabolism	Kumar SD;Kar D;Akhtar MN;Willard B;Roy D;Hussain T;Rajyaguru PI;Eswarappa SM	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1031	35848620	The erythroid K-Cl cotransport inhibitor [(dihydroindenyl)oxy]acetic acid blocks erythroid Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel KCNN4.	Red cell volume is a major determinant of HbS concentration in sickle cell disease. Cellular deoxy-HbS concentration determines the delay time, the interval between HbS deoxygenation and deoxy-HbS polymerization. Major membrane transporter protein determinants of sickle red cell volume include the SLC12/KCC K-Cl cotransporters KCC3/SLC12A6 and KCC1/SLC12A4, and the KCNN4/KCa3.1 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel (Gardos channel). Among standard inhibitors of KCC-mediated K-Cl cotransport, only [(dihydroindenyl)oxy]acetic acid (DIOA) has been reported to lack inhibitory activity against the related bumetanide-sensitive erythroid Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC1/SLC12A2. DIOA has been often used to inhibit K-Cl cotransport when studying the expression and regulation of other K<sup>+</sup> transporters and K<sup>+</sup> channels. We report here that DIOA at concentrations routinely used to inhibit K-Cl cotransport can also abrogate activity of the KCNN4/KCa3.1 Gardos channel in human and mouse red cells and in human sickle red cells. DIOA inhibition of A23187-stimulated erythroid K<sup>+</sup> uptake (Gardos channel activity) was chloride-independent and persisted in mouse red cells genetically devoid of the principal K-Cl cotransporters KCC3 and KCC1. DIOA also inhibited YODA1-stimulated, chloride-independent erythroid K<sup>+</sup> uptake. In contrast, DIOA exhibited no inhibitory effect on K<sup>+</sup> influx into A23187-treated red cells of <i>Kcnn4<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. DIOA inhibition of human KCa3.1 was validated (IC<sub>50</sub> 42 µM) by whole cell patch clamp in HEK-293 cells. RosettaLigand docking experiments identified a potential binding site for DIOA in the fenestration region of human KCa3.1. We conclude that DIOA at concentrations routinely used to inhibit K-Cl cotransport can also block the KCNN4/KCa3.1 Gardos channel in normal and sickle red cells.	eng	C694	C705	American journal of physiology.

1032	35660300	Reprint of: Is Vitamin E the Only Lipid-Soluble, Chain-Breaking Antioxidant in Human Blood Plasma and Erythrocyte Membranes?	The concentrations of lipid-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidants in human plasma and in erythrocyte ghosts have been determined for the first time by an inhibited autoxidation method. The results are very similar to the concentrations of vitamin E measured for the same blood components by the HPLC method. It is concluded that vitamin E, which is largely present as α-tocopherol, is the only significant lipid-soluble, chain-breaking type of antioxidant present in human blood. The concentration of vitamin E in the plasma lipids divided by the concentration of vitamin E in the ghost membrane lipids is approximately a constant despite the large differences in vitamin E-intake and in plasma lipid concentrations in different individuals. Vitamin E/lipid ratios for plasma and ghosts were larger for subjects taking a supplement of α-to- copherol acetate of 100 IU per week, compared to nonsupplemented subjects (based on data from a limited number of subjects). A larger supplement of 2800 IU per week did not significantly increase the vitamin E/lipid ratios.	eng	109230		Archives of biochemistry and biophysics	726		2022	Sep	15	D000975/Q000494;D004910/Q000378;D006801;D015227;D008563/Q000378;D010949;D014810	Antioxidants/pharmacology;Erythrocyte Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Lipid Peroxidation;Membrane Lipids/metabolism;Plasma;Vitamin E	W Burton G;Joyce A;U Ingold K	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.abb.2022.109230		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1033	36290682	Glutathione-Hemin/Hematin Adduct Formation to Disintegrate Cytotoxic Oxidant Hemin/Hematin in Human K562 Cells and Red Blood Cells' Hemolysates: Impact of Glutathione on the Hemolytic Disorders and Homeostasis.	Hemin, an oxidized form of heme, acts as potent oxidant to regulate glutathione (GSH) content in pro-erythroid K562 nucleated cells, via activation of the KEAP1/NRF2 defensive signaling pathway. Moreover, GSH, as an essential metabolite, is involved in the regulation of cell-redox homeostasis and proposed to scavenge cytotoxic free heme, which is released from hemoglobin of damaged red blood cells (RBCs) during different hemolytic disorders. In the present study, we aimed to uncover the molecular mechanism by which GSH inhibits hemin-induced cytotoxicity (HIC) by affecting hemin's structural integrity in K562 cells and in RBC hemolysates. GSH, along with other thiols (cysteine, thioglycolic acid, and mercaptoethanol) altered the spectrum of hemin, while each of them co-added with hemin in cultures of K562 cells prevented HIC and growth arrest and markedly reduced the intracellular level of hemin. In addition, GSH endogenous levels served as a barrier to HIC in K562 cells, as shown by the depletion in GSH. LC-MS/MS analysis of the in vitro reaction between hemin and GSH revealed at least five different isomers of GSH-hemin adducts, as well as hydroxy derivatives as reaction products, which are characterized by unique mass spectra (MS). The latter allowed the detection of adducts in human RBC hemolysates. Based on these findings, we proposed a molecular mechanism via which GSH prevents HIC and structurally disintegrates heme. An analogous reaction was observed in RBC hemolysates via direct inter-reaction between hematin (ferric and hydroxide heme) released from hemoglobin and GSH. Overall, GSH-hematin adducts could be considered as novel entities of the human metabolome of RBCs in hemolytic disorders.	eng			Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)	11	10	2022	Sep	30			Georgiou-Siafis SK;Samiotaki MK;Demopoulos VJ;Panayotou G;Tsiftsoglou AS	Journal, Articles							RBC;red blood cell;Red Blood Cell;erythro	True
1034	37760001	Red Blood Cells from Individuals with Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome: Multi-Omics Insights into a Novel S162N Mutation Causing Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase Deficiency.	Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LN) is an is an X-linked recessive inborn error of metabolism that arises from a deficiency of purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). The disease manifests severely, causing intellectual deficits and other neural abnormalities, hypercoagulability, uncontrolled self-injury, and gout. While allopurinol is used to alleviate gout, other symptoms are less understood, impeding treatment. Herein, we present a high-throughput multi-omics analysis of red blood cells (RBCs) from three pediatric siblings carrying a novel S162N HPRT1 mutation. RBCs from both parents-the mother, a heterozygous carrier, and the father, a clinically healthy control-were also analyzed. Global metabolite analysis of LN RBCs shows accumulation of glycolytic intermediates upstream of pyruvate kinase, unsaturated fatty acids, and long chain acylcarnitines. Similarly, highly unsaturated phosphatidylcholines are also elevated in LN RBCs, while free choline is decreased. Intracellular iron, zinc, selenium, and potassium are also decreased in LN RBCs. Global proteomics documented changes in RBC membrane proteins, hemoglobin, redox homeostasis proteins, and the enrichment of coagulation proteins. These changes were accompanied by elevation in protein glutamine deamidation and methylation in the LN children and carrier mother. Treatment with allopurinol incompletely reversed the observed phenotypes in the two older siblings currently on this treatment. This unique data set provides novel opportunities for investigations aimed at potential therapies for LN-associated sequelae.	eng			Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)	12	9	2023	Aug	31			Reisz JA;Dzieciatkowska M;Stephenson D;Gamboni F;Morton DH;D'Alessandro A	Journal, Articles							RBC;red blood cell;Red Blood Cell	True

1036	36643550	Oxidants and Antioxidants in the Redox Biochemistry of Human Red Blood Cells.	Red blood cells (RBCs) are exposed to both external and internal sources of oxidants that challenge their integrity and compromise their physiological function and supply of oxygen to tissues. Autoxidation of oxyhemoglobin is the main source of endogenous RBC oxidant production, yielding superoxide radical and then hydrogen peroxide. In addition, potent oxidants from other blood cells and the surrounding endothelium can reach the RBCs. Abundant and efficient enzymatic systems and low molecular weight antioxidants prevent most of the damage to the RBCs and also position the RBCs as a sink of vascular oxidants that allow the body to maintain a healthy circulatory system. Among the antioxidant enzymes, the thiol-dependent peroxidase peroxiredoxin 2, highly abundant in RBCs, is essential to keep the redox balance. A great part of the RBC antioxidant activity is supported by an active glucose metabolism that provides reducing power in the form of NADPH via the pentose phosphate pathway. There are several RBC defects and situations that generate oxidative stress conditions where the defense mechanisms are overwhelmed, and these include glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies (favism), hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell disease and thalassemia, as well as packed RBCs for transfusion that suffer from storage lesions. These oxidative stress-associated pathologies of the RBCs underline the relevance of redox balance in these anucleated cells that lack a mechanism of DNA-inducible antioxidant response and rely on a complex and robust network of antioxidant systems.	eng	147	168	ACS omega	8	1	2023	Jan	10			Möller MN;Orrico F;Villar SF;López AC;Silva N;Donzé M;Thomson L;Denicola A	Journal, Articles					10.1021/acsomega.2c06768		RBC;Red Blood Cell;Red blood cell	True
1037	36671064	Potential Antioxidative Activity of Homocysteine in Erythrocytes under Oxidative Stress.	Homocysteine is an amino acid containing a free sulfhydryl group, making it probably contribute to the antioxidative capacity in the body. We recently found that plasma total homocysteine (total-Hcy) concentration increased with time when whole blood samples were kept at room temperature. The present study was to elucidate how increased plasma total-Hcy is produced and explore the potential physiological role of homocysteine. Erythrocytes and leukocytes were separated and incubated in vitro; the amount of total-Hcy released by these two kinds of cells was then determined by HPLC-MS. The effects of homocysteine and methionine on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, osmotic fragility, and methemoglobin formation in erythrocytes under oxidative stress were studied. The reducing activities of homocysteine and methionine were tested by ferryl hemoglobin (Hb) decay assay. As a result, it was discovered that erythrocytes metabolized methionine to homocysteine, which was then oxidized within the cells and released to the plasma. Homocysteine and its precursor methionine could significantly decrease Rosup-induced ROS production in erythrocytes and inhibit Rosup-induced erythrocyte's osmotic fragility increase and methemoglobin formation. Homocysteine (but not methionine) was demonstrated to enhance ferryl Hb reduction. In conclusion, erythrocytes metabolize methionine to homocysteine, which contributes to the antioxidative capability under oxidative stress and might be a supplementary protective factor for erythrocytes against ROS damage.	eng			Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)	12	1	2023	Jan	15			Ye M;Li H;Luo H;Zhou Y;Luo W;Lin Z	Journal, Articles							Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1038	36582828	Erythroid SLC7A5/SLC3A2 amino acid carrier controls red blood cell size and maturation.	Inhibition of the heterodimeric amino acid carrier SLC7A5/SLC3A2 (LAT1/CD98) has been widely studied in tumor biology but its role in physiological conditions remains largely unknown. Here we show that the SLC7A5/SLC3A2 heterodimer is constitutively present at different stages of erythroid differentiation but absent in mature erythrocytes. Administration of erythropoietin (EPO) further induces SLC7A5/SLC3A2 expression in circulating reticulocytes, as it also occurs in anemic conditions. Although <i>Slc7a5</i> gene inactivation in the erythrocyte lineage does not compromise the total number of circulating red blood cells (RBCs), their size and hemoglobin content are significantly reduced accompanied by a diminished erythroblast mTORC1 activity. Furthermore circulating <i>Slc7a5</i>-deficient reticulocytes are characterized by lower transferrin receptor (CD71) expression as well as mitochondrial activity, suggesting a premature transition to mature RBCs. These data reveal that SLC7A5/SLC3A2 ensures adequate maturation of reticulocytes as well as the proper size and hemoglobin content of circulating RBCs.	eng	105739		iScience	26	1	2023	Jan	20			Bouthelier A;Fernández-Arroyo L;Mesa-Ciller C;Cibrian D;Martín-Cófreces NB;Castillo-González R;Calero M;Herráez-Aguilar D;Guajardo-Grence A;Pacheco AM;Marcos-Jiménez A;Quiroga B;Morado M;Monroy F;Muñoz-Calleja C;Sánchez-Madrid F;Urrutia AA;Aragonés J	Journal, Articles							Erythro;erythro;red blood cell;erythrocyte;RBC	True
1039	36682143	Effects of d-ribose on human erythrocytes: Non-enzymatic glycation of hemoglobin, eryptosis, oxidative stress and energy metabolism.	d-Ribose is not only an important component of some biomacromolecules, but also an active pentose with strong reducibility and non-enzymatic glycation ability. Previous studies reported the diverse role of d-ribose in different cells. In this study, the effects of d-ribose on non-enzymatic glycation of hemoglobin (Hb), as well as eryptosis, oxidative stress and energy metabolism of erythrocytes were observed by molecular fluorescence spectrophotometry, multi-wavelength spectrophotometry, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry (MS) and flow cytometer. The results showed that d-ribose had the strongest non-enzymatic glycation ability to Hb in vitro when compared with other monosaccharides, and could enter the erythrocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, which was not inhibited by the specific glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) inhibitor WZB117. In addition, d-ribose incubation increased the HbA1c, hemolysis, eryptosis, and ROS level of erythrocytes significantly more than that of d-glucose, however, no changes were observed in the levels of ATP, NADPH, and other intermediate energy metabolites in d-ribose treatment. Therefore, the strong non-enzymatic glycation ability of d-ribose may play an important role in erythrocyte damage.	eng	102725		Blood cells, molecules & diseases	99		2023	Mar		D006801;D000072817;D012266/Q000737;D012266/Q000378;D012266/Q000494;D015416;D004912/Q000378;D018384;D006454/Q000378;D004734;D002118/Q000378;D010718/Q000378	Humans;Eryptosis;Ribose/chemistry;Ribose/metabolism;Ribose/pharmacology;Maillard Reaction;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Oxidative Stress;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Energy Metabolism;Calcium/metabolism;Phosphatidylserines/metabolism	Zhang Z;Tai Y;Liu Z;Pu Y;An L;Li X;Li L;Wang Y;Yang Z;Duan C;Hou K;Zhang Q;Ren F;Ma Q;Su Y	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bcmd.2023.102725		Erythrocyte;erythrocyte	True
1040	36695047	Lack of the human choline transporter-like protein SLC44A2 causes hearing impairment and a rare red blood phenotype.	Blood phenotypes are defined by the presence or absence of specific blood group antigens at the red blood cell (RBC) surface, due to genetic polymorphisms among individuals. The recent development of genomic and proteomic approaches enabled the characterization of several enigmatic antigens. The choline transporter-like protein CTL2 encoded by the SLC44A2 gene plays an important role in platelet aggregation and neutrophil activation. By investigating alloantibodies to a high-prevalence antigen of unknown specificity, found in patients with a rare blood type, we showed that SLC44A2 is also expressed in RBCs and carries a new blood group system. Furthermore, we identified three siblings homozygous for a large deletion in SLC44A2, resulting in complete SLC44A2 deficiency. Interestingly, the first-ever reported SLC44A2-deficient individuals suffer from progressive hearing impairment, recurrent arterial aneurysms, and epilepsy. Furthermore, SLC44A2<sub>null</sub> individuals showed no significant platelet aggregation changes and do not suffer from any apparent hematological disorders. Overall, our findings confirm the function of SLC44A2 in hearing preservation and provide new insights into the possible role of this protein in maintaining cerebrovascular homeostasis.	eng	e16320		EMBO molecular medicine	15	3	2023	Mar	08	D006801;D040901;D026901/Q000235;D026901/Q000378;D034381/Q000235;D010641;D008562/Q000378	Humans;Proteomics;Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics;Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism;Hearing Loss/genetics;Phenotype;Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism	Koehl B;Vrignaud C;Mikdar M;Nair TS;Yang L;Landry S;Laiguillon G;Giroux-Lathuile C;Anselme-Martin S;El Kenz H;Hermine O;Mohandas N;Cartron JP;Colin Y;Detante O;Marlu R;Le Van Kim C;Carey TE;Azouzi S;Peyrard T	Journal, Articles							RBC;red blood cell	True
1041	37942280	Human red blood cells release microvesicles with distinct sizes and protein composition that alter neutrophil phagocytosis.	Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound structures released by cells and tissues into biofluids, involved in cell-cell communication. In humans, circulating red blood cells (RBCs), represent the most common cell-type in the body, generating daily large numbers of microvesicles. <i>In vitro,</i> RBC vesiculation can be mimicked by stimulating RBCs with calcium ionophores, such as ionomycin and A23187. The fate of microvesicles released during <i>in vivo</i> aging of RBCs and their interactions with circulating cells is hitherto unknown. Using SEC plus DEG isolation methods, we have found that human RBCs generate microvesicles with two distinct sizes, densities, and protein composition, identified by flow cytometry, and MRPS, and further validated by immune TEM. Furthermore, proteomic analysis revealed that RBC-derived microvesicles (RBC-MVs) are enriched in proteins with important functions in ion channel regulation, calcium homeostasis, and vesicular transport, such as of sorcin, stomatin, annexin A7, and RAB proteins. Cryo-electron microscopy identified two separate pathways of RBC-MV-neutrophil interaction, direct fusion with the plasma membrane and internalization, respectively. Functionally, RBC-MVs decrease neutrophil ability to phagocytose <i>E. coli</i> but do not affect their survival at 24 hrs. This work brings new insights regarding the complexity of the RBC-MVs biogenesis, as well as their possible role in circulation.	eng			Journal of extracellular biology	2	11	2023	Nov				de Oliveira Junior GP;Welsh JA;Pinckney B;Palu CC;Lu S;Zimmerman A;Barbosa RH;Sahu P;Noshin M;Gummuluru S;Tigges J;Jones JC;Ivanov AR;Ghiran IC	Journal, Articles							RBC;red blood cell	True
1042	37976448	Regulation of kynurenine metabolism by blood donor genetics and biology impacts red cell hemolysis in vitro and in vivo.	In the field of transfusion medicine, the clinical relevance of the metabolic markers of the red blood cell (RBC) storage lesion is incompletely understood. Here, we performed metabolomics of RBC units from 643 donors enrolled in the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study, REDS RBC Omics. These units were tested on storage days 10, 23, and 42 for a total of 1929 samples and also characterized for end-of-storage hemolytic propensity after oxidative and osmotic insults. Our results indicate that the metabolic markers of the storage lesion poorly correlated with hemolytic propensity. In contrast, kynurenine was not affected by storage duration and was identified as the top predictor of osmotic fragility. RBC kynurenine levels were affected by donor age and body mass index and were reproducible within the same donor across multiple donations from 2 to 12 months apart. To delve into the genetic underpinnings of kynurenine levels in stored RBCs, we thus tested kynurenine levels in stored RBCs on day 42 from 13 091 donors from the REDS RBC Omics study, a population that was also genotyped for 879 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Through a metabolite quantitative trait loci analysis, we identified polymorphisms in SLC7A5, ATXN2, and a series of rate-limiting enzymes (eg, kynurenine monooxygenase, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and tryptophan dioxygenase) in the kynurenine pathway as critical factors affecting RBC kynurenine levels. By interrogating a donor-recipient linkage vein-to-vein database, we then report that SLC7A5 polymorphisms are also associated with changes in hemoglobin and bilirubin levels, suggestive of in vivo hemolysis in 4470 individuals who were critically ill and receiving single-unit transfusions.	eng	456	472	Blood	143	5	2024	Feb	01	D006801;D001782;D006461;D007737/Q000378;D027283/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D055432;D001793/Q000379	Humans;Blood Donors;Hemolysis;Kynurenine/metabolism;Large Neutral Amino Acid-Transporter 1/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Metabolomics;Blood Preservation/methods	Nemkov T;Stephenson D;Erickson C;Dzieciatkowska M;Key A;Moore A;Earley EJ;Page GP;Lacroix IS;Stone M;Deng X;Raife T;Kleinman S;Zimring JC;Roubinian N;Hansen KC;Busch MP;Norris PJ;D'Alessandro A	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood.2023022052		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell;red cell	True
1043	38260479	Biological and Genetic Determinants of Glycolysis: Phosphofructokinase Isoforms Boost Energy Status of Stored Red Blood Cells and Transfusion Outcomes.	Mature red blood cells (RBCs) lack mitochondria, and thus exclusively rely on glycolysis to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during aging in vivo and during storage in vitro in the blood bank. Here we identify an association between blood donor age, sex, ethnicity and end of storage levels of glycolytic metabolites in 13,029 volunteers from the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study. Associations were also observed to ancestry-specific genetic polymorphisms in regions coding for phosphofructokinase 1, platelet - which we detected in mature RBCs - hexokinase 1, and for the ADP-ribosyl cyclase 1 and 2 (CD38/BST1). Gene-metabolite associations were validated in fresh and stored RBCs from 525 Diversity Outbred mice, and via multi-omics characterization of 1,929 samples from 643 RBC units during storage. ATP levels, breakdown and deamination into hypoxanthine were associated with hemolysis in vitro and in vivo, both in healthy autologous transfusion recipients and in 4,700 heterologous critically ill patients.	eng			bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology			2024	Jan	04			Nemkov T;Stephenson D;Earley EJ;Keele GR;Hay A;Key A;Haiman Z;Erickson C;Dzieciatkowska M;Reisz JA;Moore A;Stone M;Deng X;Kleinman S;Spitalnik SL;Hod EA;Hudson KE;Hansen KC;Palsson BO;Churchill GA;Roubinian N;Norris PJ;Busch MP;Zimring JC;Page GP;D'Alessandro A	Journal, Articles							RBC;red blood cell;Red Blood Cell	True
1044	38033286	Deciphering and disrupting PIEZO1-TMEM16F interplay in hereditary xerocytosis.	Cell-surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) is essential for phagocytic clearance and blood clotting. Although a calcium-activated phospholipid scramblase (CaPLSase) has long been proposed to mediate PS exposure in red blood cells (RBCs), its identity, activation mechanism, and role in RBC biology and disease remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that TMEM16F, the long-sought-after RBC CaPLSase, is activated by calcium influx through the mechanosensitive channel PIEZO1 in RBCs. PIEZO1-TMEM16F functional coupling is enhanced in RBCs from individuals with hereditary xerocytosis (HX), an RBC disorder caused by PIEZO1 gain-of-function channelopathy. Enhanced PIEZO1-TMEM16F coupling leads to an increased propensity to expose PS, which may serve as a key risk factor for HX clinical manifestations including anemia, splenomegaly, and postsplenectomy thrombosis. Spider toxin GsMTx-4 and antigout medication benzbromarone inhibit PIEZO1, preventing force-induced echinocytosis, hemolysis, and PS exposure in HX RBCs. Our study thus reveals an activation mechanism of TMEM16F CaPLSase and its pathophysiological function in HX, providing insights into potential treatment.	eng	357	369	Blood	143	4	2024	Jan	25	D005260;D006801;D000745/Q000235;D002118/Q000378;D004912/Q000378;D015160/Q000235;D007473/Q000235;D049294/Q000235	Female;Humans;Anemia, Hemolytic, Congenital/genetics;Calcium/metabolism;Erythrocytes/metabolism;Hydrops Fetalis/genetics;Ion Channels/genetics;Phospholipid Transfer Proteins/genetics	Liang P;Zhang Y;Wan YCS;Ma S;Dong P;Lowry AJ;Francis SJ;Khandelwal S;Delahunty M;Telen MJ;Strouse JJ;Arepally GM;Yang H	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood.2023021465		RBC;Erythrocyte;red blood cell	True

Adrenaline (epinephrine), adrenochrome and C4-substituted catechol model compounds were pulse-irradiated in aqueous neutral and alkaline solutions. Transient spectra are reported after oxidizing adrenaline and reducing adrenochrome.

The reaction of superoxide anions (O2-) with adrenaline was less efficient, compared with OH radicals. A novel oxidation product, derived from the semiquinone and O2-, has been identified as the 4-hydroxy-3,6-dioxo derivate. The pulse-radiolytic reduction of adrenochrome by hydrated electrons (eaq-) yielded the semiquinone of adrenochrome (absorbing at 470 nm), which subsequently decays by a second-order process. The dismutation products leuco-adrenochrome (absorbing at 300 nm, pH 9-8) and the adrenochrome tautomer (absorbing at 375 nm) are unstable, forming 5,6-dihydro-N-methyl indole and regenerating adrenochrome.	eng	353	371	International journal of radiation biology and related studies in physics, chemistry, and medicine	28	4	1975	Oct		D000323/Q000528;D004583;D004837/Q000528;D005609;D010084;D011830	Adrenochrome/radiation effects;Electrons;Epinephrine/radiation effects;Free Radicals;Oxidation-Reduction;Radiation Effects	Bors W;Saran M;Michel C;Lengfelder E;Fuchs C;Spöttl R	Journal, Articles								False

1051	5940	Adenylate kinases in man: evidence for a third locus.	The tissue distribution of the adenylate kinase isozymes in man has been examined using various substrates. The isozymes attributable to the AK1 and AK2 loci were identified, and an additional set of isozymes probably attributable to a third locus was also found. This locus has been provisionally designated AK3. The AK3 isozymes show activity with either GTP + AMP or ITP + AMP but do not show activity with ATP + AMP. They also differ from the AK1 and AK2 isozymes in electrophoretic mobility and from the AK1 isozymes in being resistant to silver inhibition. They are similar in molecular size to the AK1 isozymes whereas the AK2 isozymes are apparently larger. The AK3 isozymes evidently correspond to the enzyme nucleosidetriphosphate-adenylate kinase (2.7.4.10). Somatic cell hybrid studies indicate that the AK3 locus is not syntenic with that of AK2 (chromosome 1). The AK3 locus is however, probably syntenic with the AK1 locus, on chromosome 9. Genetically determined variation of AK3 has not been seen in a survey of about 80 individuals.	eng	305	313	Annals of human genetics	39	3	1976	Jan		D000249;D000263/Q000032;D000263/Q000037;D000263/Q000097;D000818;D001921/Q000201;D002874;D006224;D004586;D005347/Q000201;D005796;D006160;D006801;D006822/Q000201;D006863;D007292;D007527/Q000032;D009132/Q000201;D010770/Q000032;D012835/Q000494	Adenosine Monophosphate;Adenylate Kinase/analysis;Adenylate Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors;Adenylate Kinase/blood;Animals;Brain/enzymology;Chromosome Mapping;Cricetinae;Electrophoresis;Fibroblasts/enzymology;Genes;Guanosine Triphosphate;Humans;Hybrid Cells/enzymology;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Inosine Nucleotides;Isoenzymes/analysis;Muscles/enzymology;Phosphotransferases/analysis;Silver Nitrate/pharmacology	Wilson DE;Povey S;Harris H	Journal, Articles								False
1052	963032	Maleylacetone cis-trans-isomerase: affinity chromatography on glutathione-bound sepharose. Two-substrate-binding sequence from inhibition patterns.	Maleylacetone cis-trans-isomerase isolated from Vibrio 01 binds glutathione strongly; Km = 1.4 X 10(-4) M. Oxidized glutathione and S-methylglutathione are competitive inhibitors, KI = 9.4 X 10(-4) and 1.2 X 10(-3) M, respectively. Based on these interactions, three different glutathione-bound agarose affinity adsorbents were synthesized and tested. Affinity chromatography of the isomerase with one of these affords 70- to 100-fold purifications. In separate syntheses, portions of the affinity arm were prepared and examined as to their inhibitory properties in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The fragment, containing glutathione bound through its sulfur to the carbon chain, is a powerful competitive inhibitor for glutathione (KI = 6 X 10(-5) M). The results described suggest that the isomerase binds glutathione through the backbone of the tripeptide and that the thiol group is required for activity. The initial velocity patterns of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction resulting from simultaneous variation of glutathione and maleylacetone concentrations were examined in the absence and presence of inhibitors resembling glutathione. The observed kinetic patterns suggest an ordered sequence of binding maleylacetone first followed by glutathione.	eng	4228	4233	Biochemistry	15	19	1976	Sep	21	D001665;D002846;D005978/Q000378;D007535/Q000302;D007535/Q000378;D007700;D008298/Q000378;D011485;D014733/Q000201	Binding Sites;Chromatography, Affinity;Glutathione/metabolism;Isomerases/isolation & purification;Isomerases/metabolism;Kinetics;Maleates/metabolism;Protein Binding;Vibrio/enzymology	Morrison WS;Wong G;Seltzer S	Journal, Articles								False

The molecular weight was estimated by glycerol gradient centrifugation to be 50,000. This enzyme had an optimal activity at pH 7.1 and required a divalent cation in order to catalyze the reaction. Mg2+ and Mn2+ were found to be the preferential divalent cations. The activation energy was estimated to be 19.1 kcal/mol at pH 7.2. Initial velocity study suggested that the reaction followed a sequential mechanism. Mg2+ ATP had a Km of 0.25 mM and dTMP had a Km of 40 micrometer. The enzyme was unstable even at 4 degrees. In the presence of ATP or dTMP the enzyme maintained its activity. Purine triphosphate nucleosides were found to be better phosphate donors than the pyrimidine triphosphate nucleosides. ATP and dATP had a lower Km and a higher Vmax than GTP and dGTP. dTMP was the only preferred phosphate receptor among all the monophosphate nucleotides tested dTTP and IdUTP competed with both substrates and inhibited the reaction with a Ki of 0.75 mM and 1.1 mM, respectively.	eng	5686	5691	The Journal of biological chemistry	252	16	1977	Aug	25	D002846;D004355;D006801;D006863;D007700;D007951/Q000201;D008274/Q000494;D008345/Q000494;D008970;D009703/Q000302;D009703/Q000378;D010770/Q000302;D010770/Q000378;D013329;D013696;D013938	Chromatography, Affinity;Drug Stability;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology;Magnesium/pharmacology;Manganese/pharmacology;Molecular Weight;Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/isolation & purification;Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/metabolism;Phosphotransferases/isolation & purification;Phosphotransferases/metabolism;Structure-Activity Relationship;Temperature;Thymidine Monophosphate	Lee LS;Cheng Y	Journal, Articles								False

1055	79156	Chlordecone intoxication in man. II. Ultrastructure of peripheral nerves and skeletal muscle.	"Tremors, mental changes, opsoclonus, muscle weakness, gait ataxia, incoordination, and slurred speech developed in several employees in a Virginia chemical plant during the summer of 1974. Epidemiologic and clinical studies suggested that the chlorinated insecticide chlordecone (Kepone) was responsible. Severity of symptoms seemed directly related to dose and duration of exposure. Five sural nerve and six muscle biopsy specimens were examined by light microscopy and electronmicroscopy. The sural nerves were also evaluated by computerized morphometry, which showed considerable decrease in the number of unmyelinated fibers and lesser abnormalities of myelinated fibers. Compared with the nerves of the control subjects, those of patients may have had an increase in Reich and Elzholz bodies, and a modest increase in endoneurial collagen. There were occasional ""collagen pockets,"" stacks of Schwann cell cytoplasmic membranes, redundant Schwann cell cytoplasmic folds, and fewer unmyelinated axons. The skeletal muscles contained increased amounts of lipofuscin and lipidlike droplets in subsarcolemmal areas and within intermyofibrillary spaces; the significance of this is unknown. Fiber size variability, type I predominance, and type grouping were present in three cases. All results strongly suggest that chlordecone is a neurotoxic agent predominantly affecting Schwann cells and unmyelinated fibers of peripheral nerves."	eng	631	635	Neurology	28	7	1978	Jul		D000328;D007631/Q000378;D007631/Q000506;D004781;D006801;D007306/Q000506;D008297;D009132/Q000648;D009784/Q000139;D009784/Q000378;D009784/Q000473;D010525/Q000648;D013497/Q000648	Adult;Chlordecone/metabolism;Chlordecone/poisoning;Environmental Exposure;Humans;Insecticides/poisoning;Male;Muscles/ultrastructure;Occupational Diseases/chemically induced;Occupational Diseases/metabolism;Occupational Diseases/pathology;Peripheral Nerves/ultrastructure;Sural Nerve/ultrastructure	Martinez AJ;Taylor JR;Dyck PJ;Houff SA;Isaacs E	Journal, Articles								False
1056	444544	Purification and properties of 2'-nucleotidase from mammalian brain.	A nucleotidase specific for 2'-nucleotides was localized in both the soluble and the synaptosomal fractions of rat brain. The enzyme was partially purified from the soluble fraction of bovine brain. The s20,w was 4.9 S with an estimated molecular weight of about 70 000. The optimum pH was 8.0 and Km value for 2'-AMP was 5.5 . 10(-4) M. The substrate and inhibitor specificities of the enzyme were examined. The nucleotidase has an absolute requirement for Mg2+ but neither Fe3+ nor Ca2+ acted as replacement ions. In fact, Mn2+ and Ca2+ inhibited the Mg2+-dependent 2'-nucleotidase.	eng	30	38	Biochimica et biophysica acta	568	1	1979	May	10	D000249;D000818;D001921/Q000201;D002413;D007700;D008297;D008970;D009708/Q000302;D009708/Q000378;D051381;D013379	Adenosine Monophosphate;Animals;Brain/enzymology;Cations, Divalent;Kinetics;Male;Molecular Weight;Nucleotidases/isolation & purification;Nucleotidases/metabolism;Rats;Substrate Specificity	Nakamura S;Yamao S;Ito J;Kameyama M	Journal, Articles								False

1058	7372663	Characteristics of an amino acid transport system in rat liver for glutamine, asparagine, histidine, and closely related analogs.	"In the rat hepatocyte, whether freshly separated or in primary culture, we do not find L-glutamine entry by Systems A and ASC as seen in cells previously studied. Instead the mediated entry of glutamine appears to occur exclusively by a Na+-dependent system (""N"") apparently specific to amino acid amides and L-histidine; however, a portion of asparagine uptake occurs by System A. The simplest evidence for the separateness of the added system is the failure of model substrates for System A (e.g. N-methylalanine) to inhibit glutamine uptake significantly, and the failure of glutamine to inhibit the uptake of L-cysteine, model substrate for System ASC, at least in this cell. As is the case for cysteine, glutamine inhibits transport by System A (although not competitively), even though showing no transport by that system. Our finding confirms an earlier inference that glutamine uptake by this cell may follow a route not taken by alanine or serine, and explains the apparently erroneous companion inference that glutamine also shares a route with these two amino acids. Its uptake has now been characterized to show a series of differences from Systems A and ASC. Especially significant in view of the importance of glutamine metabolism are an insensitivity of the new system to stimulation by either insulin or glucagon, and its distinct enhancement (not as large as that for System A) on starvation of the cells with respect to amino acids. Hence, a second system has been found to show adaptive regulation."	eng	4011	4019	The Journal of biological chemistry	255	9	1980	May	10	D000596/Q000378;D000596/Q000494;D000818;D001216/Q000378;D001692/Q000187;D002478;D002794/Q000494;D005973/Q000378;D006639/Q000378;D006863;D007700;D008094/Q000494;D008099/Q000187;D008099/Q000378;D008297;D051381;D012964/Q000494;D013329	Amino Acids/metabolism;Amino Acids/pharmacology;Animals;Asparagine/metabolism;Biological Transport/drug effects;Cells, Cultured;Choline/pharmacology;Glutamine/metabolism;Histidine/metabolism;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Lithium/pharmacology;Liver/drug effects;Liver/metabolism;Male;Rats;Sodium/pharmacology;Structure-Activity Relationship	Kilberg MS;Handlogten ME;Christensen HN	Journal, Articles								False
1059	6171809	Structure of the zeta chain of human embryonic hemoglobin.	The complete amino acid sequence of the zeta chain of human embryonic hemoglobin has been determined. It differs from human alpha globin at 57 of the 141 residues and several of the replacements are at positions of structural or functional importance, particularly in relationship to the Bohr effect and high intrinsic oxygen affinity which are characteristic of embryonic hemoglobins. The zeta-globin sequence is more closely related to other mammalian embryonic alpha-like globins than to human alpha, suggesting that there have been strong selective pressures to maintain these embryo-specific globins since their emergence several hundred million years ago.	eng	6076	6080	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	78	10	1981	Oct		D000595;D005260;D005319/Q000378;D014644;D006455;D006801;D007700;D046911;D010108/Q000378;D010446/Q000032;D011247	Amino Acid Sequence;Female;Fetal Hemoglobin/metabolism;Genetic Variation;Hemoglobins, Abnormal;Humans;Kinetics;Macromolecular Substances;Oxyhemoglobins/metabolism;Peptide Fragments/analysis;Pregnancy	Clegg JB;Gagnon J	Journal, Articles								False
1060	7132951	Subunit selectivity in the monooxygenase-like activity of tetrameric hemoglobin.	The aniline hydroxylase activity of adult rabbit hemolysates (1 mM with respect to hemoglobin concentration) was found to be 80 pmoles of p-aminophenol formed per minute per milliliter. This value is comparable to that observed for adult human hemolysates. The characteristics of this O2-requiring aromatic p-hydroxylation reaction are typical of the monooxygenase reactions catalyzed by the liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 system. Both systems are inhibited by carbon monoxide, which coordinates directly with the heme iron atoms of the respective hemoproteins. With the use of 13C-NMR spectroscopy, separate, well-resolved signals were observed for 13C-enriched carbon monoxide bound to the alpha- and beta-subunits of the tetrameric (alpha 2 beta 2) rabbit hemoglobin. By appropriately adjusting conditions, the hemoglobin was converted into hybrids of ligation varying from full oxygenation to intermediate forms in which the oxygen was progressively replaced by 13CO, first on the beta-subunits, then on the alpha-subunits until full CO ligation was accomplished. The state of ligation of the hemoglobin in each case was determined from the integrated areas of the signals in the corresponding 13C-NMR spectra. The corresponding aniline hydroxylase activity of the rabbit hemolysates containing such hybrids revealed that the monooxygenase activity of intact tetrameric hemoglobin is determined predominantly (if not exclusively) by the ligation of the beta-subunits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of differential subunit behavior for a monooxygenase-like enzymatic activity.	eng	1	4	Molecular pharmacology	21	1	1982	Jan		D000815/Q000378;D000818;D002248/Q000494;D003577/Q000378;D006454/Q000378;D066298;D006899/Q000378;D010088/Q000378;D011817	Aniline Hydroxylase/metabolism;Animals;Carbon Monoxide/pharmacology;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism;Hemoglobins/metabolism;In Vitro Techniques;Mixed Function Oxygenases/metabolism;Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Rabbits	Ferraiolo BL;Mieyal JJ	Journal, Articles								False
1061	6539334	Human hemoglobin Portland II (zeta 2 beta 2). Isolation and characterization of Portland hemoglobin components and their constituent globin chains.	Two types of embryonic hemoglobins (Hb) containing zeta chains have been identified in the blood of several neonates of Chinese origin with homozygous alpha-thalassemia. In addition to Hb Portland I (zeta 2 gamma 2) which was previously reported, another embryonic hemoglobin has been detected and found to contain zeta chains and beta chains. It is being designated Hb Portland II and has the formula (zeta 2 beta 2). It has a mobility slightly slower than that of Hb A on starch gel electrophoresis at pH 8.6 and has been found in the hemolysates of blood of some but not all hydropic infants. Another component with a mobility faster than that of Hb A2 on starch gel has been isolated from the blood of some hydropic neonates. This latter component is postulated to be zeta 2 delta 2. The occurrence of Hb Portland I and Hb Portland II in these hydropic neonates is consistent with the hypothesis that, in the absence of normal alpha chain production, zeta chains are continued to be produced at later states of development than normal and form tetramers with each of the beta-like globin chains. Because Hb Portland II has not been found in blood from all hydropic neonates, we postulate that the presence of this hemoglobin in these fetuses may be correlated with the gestational age of the fetus at the time of birth.	eng	7325	7330	The Journal of biological chemistry	259	11	1984	Jun	10	D000596/Q000032;D004592;D005260;D005313/Q000097;D006455/Q000302;D006801;D007231;D007525;D011247;D013789/Q000097;D014357/Q000378	Amino Acids/analysis;Electrophoresis, Starch Gel;Female;Fetal Death/blood;Hemoglobins, Abnormal/isolation & purification;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Isoelectric Focusing;Pregnancy;Thalassemia/blood;Trypsin/metabolism	Randhawa ZI;Jones RT;Lie-Injo LE	Journal, Articles								False
1062	6199843	The enzymatic synthesis of 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside triphosphate (ZTP).	5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside triphosphate (ZTP) is thought to play a regulatory role in cellular metabolism. Unlike other nucleoside triphosphates, ZTP is synthesized in a one-step reaction in which the pyrophosphate group of 5-phosphoribosyl-l-pyrophosphate is transferred to the riboside monophosphate (ZMP) in a reaction catalyzed by 5-phosphoribosyl-l-pyrophosphate synthetase; reversal of this reaction leads to dephosphorylation of ZTP to ZMP. This unusual route of synthesis (and catabolism) of ZTP may be important in defining its metabolic effects in the cell.	eng	1193	1195	Science (New York, N.Y.)	223	4641	1984	Mar	16	D000255/Q000378;D000620/Q000031;D000620/Q000096;D000620/Q000494;D000818;D002460;D006224;D007093/Q000096;D007700;D010754/Q000378;D010766;D012263/Q000494;D012265/Q000096;D012268/Q000378;D013379	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/biosynthesis;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/pharmacology;Animals;Cell Line;Cricetinae;Imidazoles/biosynthesis;Kinetics;Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate/metabolism;Phosphorylation;Ribonucleosides/pharmacology;Ribonucleotides/biosynthesis;Ribose-Phosphate Pyrophosphokinase/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Sabina RL;Holmes EW;Becker MA	Journal, Articles								False
1063	6439211	Kinetic study and intermediates identification of noradrenaline oxidation by tyrosinase.	Characterization of intermediates formed in the noradrenaline oxidation by mushroom tyrosinase and sodium periodate has been performed by rapid scanning spectrophotometry and graphical analysis of obtained spectra. In a pH range from 5.0 to 6.0, it has been possible to detect o-noradrenalinequinone-H+ as the first intermediate in these oxidations. The following steps for noradrenaline transformation into noradrenochrome would be: noradrenaline----o-noradrenalinequinone-H+----o- noradrenalinequinone----leukonoradrenochrome----noradreno chrome. It has been also verified that o-noradrenalinequinone-H+ is transformed into noradrenochrome at a constant ratio. The stoichiometry for this converstion followed the equation: 2-noradrenalinequinone-H+----noradrenaline + noradrenochrome. The pathway between noradrenaline and noradrenochrome has been studied as a system of various chemical reactions coupled to an enzymatic reaction. We have denominated this type of mechanism as an enzymatic-chemical-chemical mechanism, (E2CC). Whole rate constants for the implicated chemical steps at different pH and temperature values have been evaluated from measurement of the lag period arising from the accumulation of noradrenochrome that takes place when noradrenaline was oxidized at pH 5-6. The lag period was independent on enzyme concentration, but was increased when pH and/or temperature were increased. Rate constants pH independent for the deprotonation of noradrenalinequinone-H+ into noradrenalinequinone and for the internal cyclization of noradrenalinequinone into leukonoradrenochrome have been obtained. We conclude that this minor pathway of noradrenaline oxidation by tyrosinase follows a scheme similar to that established for L-dopa.	eng	3689	3697	Biochemical pharmacology	33	22	1984	Nov	15	D001487/Q000201;D004156/Q000378;D004837/Q000031;D006863;D007700;D008433;D014442/Q000378;D009638/Q000378	Basidiomycota/enzymology;Catechol Oxidase/metabolism;Epinephrine/analogs & derivatives;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Mathematics;Monophenol Monooxygenase/metabolism;Norepinephrine/metabolism	Jimenez M;Garcia-Canovas F;Garcia-Carmona F;Lozano JA;Iborra JL	Journal, Articles								False
1064	3997815	5-Amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (Z-riboside) metabolism in eukaryotic cells.	Metabolites of 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (Z-riboside) have potential roles in the regulation of cellular metabolism and as pharmacological agents in several pathological situations. Before studying Z-riboside metabolism it was necessary to develop methods for identifying and quantitating 5(4)-amino-4(5)-imidazolecarboxamide metabolites. These studies utilized Chinese hamster ovary fibroblast auxotrophic mutants to identify and isolate compounds relevant to Z-riboside metabolism by a combination of high performance liquid chromatographic procedures. In order to study Z-riboside metabolism wild-type and mutant cells were cultured in Z-riboside. This ribosyl precursor to a purine de novo intermediate does not undergo any detectable phosphorolysis but rather is phosphorylated by adenosine kinase in an unregulated manner. This results in the intracellular accumulation of 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide ribotide (ZMP), the levels of which control flow from Z-riboside to the following metabolites: 1) IMP and other purine nucleotides, 2) 5-amino-4-imidazole-N-succinocarboxamide ribotide (sZMP), and 3) 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside 5'-triphosphate (ZTP). At low ZMP concentrations, the predominant metabolic fate is IMP. Initially, IMP enters the adenylate and guanylate pools, but subsequently is hydrolyzed to inosine and this phosphorolyzed to hypoxanthine. At intermediate ZMP concentrations there is net retrograde flux through the bifunctional enzyme adenylosuccinate AMP lyase resulting in sZMP synthesis and antegrade flux leads to the accumulation of adenylosuccinate. At high ZMP concentrations, ZTP accumulates. In addition to these effects on purine metabolism, pyrimidine nucleotide pools are depleted when ZMP accumulates. These results are discussed in relation to the regulation of purine nucleotide synthesis and the use of Z-riboside as a pharmacological intervention in pathophysiological situations.	eng	6107	6114	The Journal of biological chemistry	260	10	1985	May	25	D000249/Q000031;D000249/Q000378;D000620/Q000031;D000620/Q000378;D000818;D002478;D006224;D003412;D005260;D005347/Q000378;D007093/Q000378;D007291/Q000378;D010053/Q000378;D011685/Q000378;D011742/Q000378;D012263/Q000378;D012265/Q000378	Adenosine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives;Adenosine Monophosphate/metabolism;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/metabolism;Animals;Cells, Cultured;Cricetinae;Cricetulus;Female;Fibroblasts/metabolism;Imidazoles/metabolism;Inosine Monophosphate/metabolism;Ovary/metabolism;Purine Nucleotides/metabolism;Pyrimidine Nucleotides/metabolism;Ribonucleosides/metabolism;Ribonucleotides/metabolism	Sabina RL;Patterson D;Holmes EW	Journal, Articles								False
1065	3700416	Reaction of acetaldehyde with hemoglobin.	Acetaldehyde reacted with hemoglobin at neutral pH and 37 degrees C to form adducts that were stable to dialysis and that were not reduced by sodium borohydride. Hemoglobin tetramers having 2, 3, and probably 4 molar eq of bound aldehyde were isolated by cation exchange chromatography. The sites of attachment of the aldehyde were the free amino groups of the N-terminal valine residues of the alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin. Derivatization of the beta chains caused a greater increase in the acidity of the hemoglobin than did derivatization of the alpha chains. Derivatization of the beta chains was also preferred over that of the alpha chains. Acetaldehyde derivatives of the N-terminal octapeptide of hemoglobin S (beta sT-1 peptide), Val-Gly-Gly, and tetraglycine were formed readily, contained 1 M eq of acetaldehyde/mol of peptide, and were not reduced by sodium borohydride. In contrast, Ala-Pro-Gly failed to form a 1:1 adduct with acetaldehyde. 13C NMR analysis of the peptide adducts formed with [1,2-13C]acetaldehyde indicated that tetrahedral diastereomeric derivatives were produced. The 13C chemical shifts of the adducts formed between hemoglobin and [1,2-13C]acetaldehyde were identical to those of the peptide adducts although resonances from the individual diastereomeric adducts at each hemoglobin site could not be resolved. The results cited above as well as other evidence indicate that acetaldehyde reacts with the amino termini of hemoglobin to form stable cyclic imidazolidinone derivatives. An exchange of acetaldehyde residues between peptides was also documented.	eng	6811	6821	The Journal of biological chemistry	261	15	1986	May	25	D000079/Q000378;D001665;D002851;D006442/Q000378;D006441/Q000378;D006801;D046911;D009682;D011485;D014316	Acetaldehyde/metabolism;Binding Sites;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Glycated Hemoglobin/metabolism;Hemoglobin A/metabolism;Humans;Macromolecular Substances;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Protein Binding;Tritium	San George RC;Hoberman HD	Journal, Articles								False
1066	2822713	Porphobilinogen oxygenase. Purification and evidence of its hemoprotein structure.	Porphobilinogen oxygenase oxidizes porphobilinogen to 2-hydroxy-5-oxo-porphobilinogen. This enzyme isolated from wheat germ has been purified to homogeneity, as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under both nondenaturing and denaturing conditions. The molecular weight of the enzyme formed from two identical (or very similar) polypeptide chains is 70,000. It has a pI of 9.0 indicating its cationic nature. The pure enzyme contains 1 mol of high-spin heme and 2 mol of non-heme iron. It requires both of these as well as molecular O2 and a reducing agent for catalytic activity. Although the enzyme has many characteristics of a peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide cannot substitute for oxygen and dithionite for catalysis. The catalytic reaction is not affected by catalase, superoxide dismutase, or by hydroxyl radical scavengers. A comparison between porphobilinogen oxygenase and a commercial preparation of horseradish peroxidase was made. The latter also catalyzes aerobic porphobilinogen oxidation, with dithionite as electron donor. Here the oxidation of porphobilinogen is inhibited by superoxide dismutase and was not affected by catalase.	eng	15118	15126	The Journal of biological chemistry	262	31	1987	Nov	05	D000596/Q000032;D004578;D006418/Q000032;D006420/Q000302;D007700;D006899/Q000302;D006899/Q000378;D008970;D010944/Q000201;D013053;D014908/Q000201	Amino Acids/analysis;Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy;Heme/analysis;Hemeproteins/isolation & purification;Kinetics;Mixed Function Oxygenases/isolation & purification;Mixed Function Oxygenases/metabolism;Molecular Weight;Plants/enzymology;Spectrophotometry;Triticum/enzymology	Frydman RB;Rosenfeld J;Camoretti-Mercado B;Peisach J	Journal, Articles								False
1067	3365415	Purification and characterization of human liver sorbitol dehydrogenase.	Sorbitol dehydrogenase from human liver was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on immobilized triazine dyes, conventional cation-exchange chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The major form is a tetrameric, NAD-specific enzyme containing one zinc atom per subunit. Human liver sorbitol dehydrogenase oxidizes neither ethanol nor other primary alcohols. It catalyzes the oxidation of a secondary alcohol group of polyol substrates such as sorbitol, xylitol, or L-threitol. However, the substrate specificity of human liver sorbitol dehydrogenase is broader than that of the liver enzymes of other sources. The present report describes the stereospecific oxidation of (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol, indicating a more general function of sorbitol dehydrogenase in the metabolism of secondary alcohols. Thus, the enzyme complements the substrate specificities covered by the three classes of human liver alcohol dehydrogenase.	eng	1622	1628	Biochemistry	27	5	1988	Mar	08	D000596/Q000032;D000818;D006801;D007700;D007064/Q000302;D007064/Q000378;D008099/Q000201;D012756;D013045;D013379;D013401/Q000302	Amino Acids/analysis;Animals;Humans;Kinetics;L-Iditol 2-Dehydrogenase/isolation & purification;L-Iditol 2-Dehydrogenase/metabolism;Liver/enzymology;Sheep;Species Specificity;Substrate Specificity;Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases/isolation & purification	Maret W;Auld DS	Journal, Articles								False
1068	3346220	Cysteinesulfonate and beta-sulfopyruvate metabolism. Partitioning between decarboxylation, transamination, and reduction pathways.	L-Cysteinesulfonate (L-cysteate) is present in plasma, urine, and tissues in concentrations comparable to that of L-cysteinesulfinate, the primary oxidative metabolite of L-cysteine. Although cysteinesulfonate is known to be decarboxylated to taurine by cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase, the occurrence and importance of other metabolisms has not been examined. The present studies indicate that cysteinesulfonate partitions in vivo between decarboxylation and transamination; the latter reaction is catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase and yields beta-sulfopyruvate. Whereas beta-sulfinylpyruvate, the product of cysteinesulfinate transamination, decomposes spontaneously, beta-sulfopyruvate is stable and is reduced by malate dehydrogenase to beta-sulfolactate. When L-[1-14C]cysteinesulfonate is given to mice, 60-75% is decarboxylated to taurine and about 25% is excreted in the urine as beta-sulfolactate. beta-Sulfo[1-14C] pyruvate is found to partition about equally between beta-sulfolactate and cysteinesulfonate formation; greater than 90% of the latter is decarboxylated. Parenterally administered beta-sulfo[1-14C]lactate is mostly excreted in the urine, but 12% is metabolized via beta-sulfopyruvate and cysteinesulfonate to 14CO2 and taurine. beta-Sulfopyruvate is not excreted, and only traces of sulfoacetate, perhaps formed by oxidative decarboxylation, are detected. These studies establish that cysteinesulfonate, beta-sulfopyruvate, and beta-sulfolactate are reversibly interconverted in vivo. Since only cysteinesulfonate is directly metabolized to CO2, the rate of 14CO2 formation from L-[1-14C]cysteinesulfonate is a valid measure of total cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase activity in vivo; use of this assay permits inhibitor effects to be accurately determined in intact mice. Thus, whereas in vitro assays indicate that beta-methyleneaspartate inhibits brain, liver, and kidney cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase by 0, greater than 60, and 90%, respectively, in vivo studies with L-[1-14C]cysteinesulfonate show net metabolic inhibition is about 40%.	eng	3735	3743	The Journal of biological chemistry	263	8	1988	Mar	15	D000818;D001219/Q000378;D001711;D002250;D003545/Q000031;D003545/Q000378;D007527/Q000378;D007700;D051379;D010084;D011773/Q000378;D013379	Animals;Aspartate Aminotransferases/metabolism;Biotransformation;Carbon Radioisotopes;Cysteine/analogs & derivatives;Cysteine/metabolism;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Kinetics;Mice;Oxidation-Reduction;Pyruvates/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Weinstein CL;Griffith OW	Journal, Articles								False
1069	3061454	Equilibrium of 5,6-hydration of NADH and mechanism of ATP-dependent dehydration.	At equilibrium, water addition to the 5,6 double bond of NADH was observed to favor the hydrate by a factor of approximately 100. Hydration generates two epimers of NADHX (beta-6-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Only the 6S epimer of the hydrate was found to serve as a true substrate for an ATP-dependent dehydratase from yeast that regenerates NADH. Yet enzymatic conversion of both epimers of the hydrate to NADH was found to proceed essentially to completion in the presence of ATP and dehydratase. This is explained by the observed ability of the epimers to undergo rapid spontaneous equilibration, so that it is unnecessary to postulate a lack of stereospecificity in the dehydratase.	eng	7371	7375	Biochemistry	27	19	1988	Sep	20	D000246/Q000031;D000246/Q000378;D000255/Q000494;D002851;D005987/Q000378;D006836/Q000378;D006863;D007700;D009243/Q000031;D009243/Q000378;D012441/Q000201;D013237;D013379;D014867/Q000378	Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/analogs & derivatives;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/metabolism;Hydro-Lyases/metabolism;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;NAD/analogs & derivatives;NAD/metabolism;Saccharomyces cerevisiae/enzymology;Stereoisomerism;Substrate Specificity;Water/metabolism	Acheson SA;Kirkman HN;Wolfenden R	Journal, Articles								False
1070	2806555	Evidence for the identity of glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase and class III alcohol dehydrogenase.	Formaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.1) is a widely occurring enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of S-hydroxymethylglutathione, formed from formaldehyde and glutathione, into S-formyglutathione in the presence of NAD. We determined the amino acid sequences for 5 tryptic peptides (containing altogether 57 amino acids) from electrophoretically homogeneous rat liver formaldehyde dehydrogenase and found that they all were exactly homologous to the sequence of rat liver class III alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH-2). Formaldehyde dehydrogenase was found to be able at high pH values to catalyze the NAD-dependent oxidation of long-chain aliphatic alcohols like n-octanol and 12-hydroxydodecanoate but ethanol was used only at very high substrate concentrations and pyrazole was not inhibitory. The amino acid sequence homology and identical structural and kinetic properties indicate that formaldehyde dehydrogenase and the mammalian class III alcohol dehydrogenases are identical enzymes.	eng	105	109	FEBS letters	257	1	1989	Oct	23	D000426/Q000235;D000445/Q000235;D000445/Q000302;D000445/Q000378;D000595;D000818;D003600/Q000201;D005260;D005978/Q000494;D007527/Q000235;D008099/Q000201;D008969;D010446/Q000302;D051381;D011919;D012689;D013379	Alcohol Dehydrogenase/genetics;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/genetics;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/isolation & purification;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Cytosol/enzymology;Female;Glutathione/pharmacology;Isoenzymes/genetics;Liver/enzymology;Molecular Sequence Data;Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification;Rats;Rats, Inbred Strains;Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid;Substrate Specificity	Koivusalo M;Baumann M;Uotila L	Journal, Articles								False

Acta 235, 128-141) was purified 15,000-fold to apparent homogeneity from human placenta. The soluble enzyme is a homodimer with a native molecular mass of 44-45 kDa. It has a pH optimum between 6.0 and 6.5 and is absolutely dependent on Mg2+ ions. The enzyme dephosphorylates certain 2'-, 3'-, and 5'-nucleotides. Km values for 2'- and 3'-nucleotides are around 0.3 mM with no preference for either ribo- or deoxyribonucleotides. 5'-Deoxyribonucleotides are 10-fold better substrates than the corresponding ribonucleotides, with dIMP greater than dUMP greater than dGMP greater than dTMP. dAMP is a poor substrate, dCMP is essentially insert. In all cases the Km values are in the millimolar range. Of the different forms of nucleotidases characterized in animal cells, the 5'(3')-nucleotidase is unique in its preference for 5'-deoxyribonucleotides. In intact cells, a portion of de novo synthesized deoxyribonucleotides is degraded as part of a homeostatic mechanism regulating the size of deoxyribonucleotide pools. This requires the participation of one or several 5'-nucleotidases. The 5'(3')-nucleotidase may be one such enzyme.	eng	6589	6595	The Journal of biological chemistry	265	12	1990	Apr	25	D015720;D002850;D002852;D003593/Q000201;D005260;D006801;D007700;D046911;D008970;D009708/Q000302;D009708/Q000378;D010920/Q000201;D011247;D013379	5'-Nucleotidase;Chromatography, Gel;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Cytoplasm/enzymology;Female;Humans;Kinetics;Macromolecular Substances;Molecular Weight;Nucleotidases/isolation & purification;Nucleotidases/metabolism;Placenta/enzymology;Pregnancy;Substrate Specificity	Höglund L;Reichard P	Journal, Articles								False

The reticulocyte specific 3'non-translated sequence has 15 new nucleotides then utilizes the liver mRNA sequence from amino acid 97 onward.

1075	1897935	Cytochrome b5-mediated redox cycling of estrogen.	"Previously, we have demonstrated microsomal cytochrome P450-catalyzed redox cycling of estrogens. In this study, we investigated the role of cytochrome b5 in redox cycling in order to obtain a full understanding of enzymatic contributions to redox reactions of estrogens. Pure cytochrome P450c and hydrogen peroxide or cumene hydroperoxide oxidized diethylstilbestrol (DES) to diethylstilbestrol-4',4""-quinone (DES Q). This oxidation by H2O2 was doubled by addition of cytochrome b5 to cytochrome P450c (molar ratio of 1:4), but did not proceed with cytochrome b5 alone. The stimulation by cytochrome b5 of the cytochrome P450c-catalyzed oxidation of DES to DES Q occurred via modulation of the Vmax of cytochrome P450c rather than of the Km. DES Q was reduced to DES by purified cytochrome b5 and NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 reductase. Pretreatment of microsomes with an antibody to cytochrome b5 reductase inhibited microsomal NADH-dependent reduction of DES Q to DES by 55%. Cytochrome b5 likely participates in the oxidation of DES to DES Q by interacting with cytochrome P450c and in the reduction of DES Q to DES by interacting with cytochrome b5 reductase. Thus, the study demonstrates that cytochrome b5 plays an active role in biological oxidation and reduction reactions."	eng	331	338	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics	285	2	1991	Mar		D000818;D003577/Q000378;D003579/Q000378;D042966;D015786/Q000378;D004054/Q000031;D004054/Q000378;D006861/Q000378;D007700;D008297;D008862/Q000201;D010084;D051381;D011919	Animals;Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism;Cytochrome Reductases/metabolism;Cytochrome-B(5) Reductase;Cytochromes b5/metabolism;Diethylstilbestrol/analogs & derivatives;Diethylstilbestrol/metabolism;Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism;Kinetics;Male;Microsomes, Liver/enzymology;Oxidation-Reduction;Rats;Rats, Inbred Strains	Roy D;Strobel HW;Liehr JG	Journal, Articles								False
1076	1429566	On the mechanisms of the formation of L-alloisoleucine and the 2-hydroxy-3-methylvaleric acid stereoisomers from L-isoleucine in maple syrup urine disease patients and in normal humans.	2-Keto-3-methylvaleric acid (KMVA) has been found not to undergo spontaneous keto-enol tautomerization in neutral aqueous solution, alone or in the presence of large concentrations of pyridoxamine or pyridoxamine-5-phosphate. This finding denies the commonly held suppositions that 3R-KMVA is derived spontaneously from 3S-KMVA in vivo, and that L-alloisoleucine is the product of the reamination of this 3R-KMVA. Evidence presented here suggests that racemization of the 3-carbon of L-isoleucine occurs during transamination, that L-alloisoleucine is an inherently unavoidable by-product of L-isoleucine transamination (and vice versa), and that a KMVA enol is not obligate in this racemization. The four stereoisomers of 2-hydroxy-3-methylvaleric acid have been synthesized and the mass spectra of their trimethylsilyl derivatives recorded. An achiral methylsilicone column was used to separate the diastereomeric pairs and to determine their relative ratios in plasma and urine from normal controls and two maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) patients. The urinary ratio of the two diastereomers is different from that for plasma, both in normals and in MSUD patients. The plasma ratios may provide a rapid and simple measure of residual branched chain 2-keto acid dehydrogenase activity in MSUD patients.	eng	22141	22147	The Journal of biological chemistry	267	31	1992	Nov	05	D002849;D008401;D006801;D007532/Q000737;D007532/Q000378;D009682;D008375/Q000378;D010421/Q000737;D010421/Q000378;D013237	Chromatography, Gas;Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry;Humans;Isoleucine/chemistry;Isoleucine/metabolism;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Maple Syrup Urine Disease/metabolism;Pentanoic Acids/chemistry;Pentanoic Acids/metabolism;Stereoisomerism	Mamer OA;Reimer ML	Journal, Articles								False
1077	1438298	Molecular cloning and primary structure of the human blood group RhD polypeptide.	The RH (rhesus) blood group locus from RhD-positive donors is composed of two homologous structural genes, one of which encodes the Cc and Ee polypeptides, whereas the other, which is missing in the RhD-negative condition, encodes the D protein that carries the major antigen of the RH system. Recently, different splicing isoforms transcribed from the CcEe gene were isolated. We report now the characterization of two other Rh clones, RhII and RhXIII, generated by alternative choices for poly(A) addition sites that were identified as the RhD gene transcripts. That these cDNAs represented the RhD messenger and that the previously described Rh clones were derived from the CcEe gene was demonstrated by amplification of RhII/XIII sequences only from D-positive genomes and by cloning and sequencing of D- and CcEe-specific gene fragments. The predicted translation product of the RhD mRNA is a 417-amino acid protein (M(r) = 45,500) that exhibited a similar membrane organization with 13 bilayer-spanning domains compared with the polypeptide encoded by the CcEe gene. The D and Cc/Ee polypeptides differ by 36 amino acid substitutions (8.4% divergence), but the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of the two proteins are well conserved. Similarly, five of the six cysteine residues of the Cc/Ee proteins were conserved in the D protein, including the unique exofacial cysteine, which is critical for antigenic reactivity. The sequence homology between the Cc/Ee and D proteins supports the concept that the genes encoding these polypeptides have evolved by duplication of a common ancestor gene.	eng	10925	10929	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	89	22	1992	Nov	15	D000595;D001483;D015139;D001853/Q000502;D003001;D004247/Q000235;D004247/Q000302;D015342;D005796;D015698;D006801;D046911;D008961;D008969;D009838;D016133;D011487;D012333/Q000235;D012204/Q000235	Amino Acid Sequence;Base Sequence;Blotting, Southern;Bone Marrow/physiology;Cloning, Molecular;DNA/genetics;DNA/isolation & purification;DNA Probes;Genes;Genomic Library;Humans;Macromolecular Substances;Models, Structural;Molecular Sequence Data;Oligodeoxyribonucleotides;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Protein Conformation;RNA, Messenger/genetics;Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/genetics	Le van Kim C;Mouro I;Chérif-Zahar B;Raynal V;Cherrier C;Cartron JP;Colin Y	Journal, Articles								False
1078	1398218	Biochemical and toxicological properties of the oxidation products of catecholamines.	The normal catabolism of catecholamines proceeds through enzymatic pathways (monoaminooxidase, catechol-o-methyltranserase, and phenolsulphotransferase). In addition, nonenzymatic oxidative pathways might take place since catechols are readily oxidized. In this review article, the pathways of formation of the oxidation products of catecholamines and their reactions are described. The interactions of these products with different biological systems and their toxicity are examined. Among the reactions known to occur is that with sulfhydryls, which results in either a covalently linked adduct or disulfide production. Another interesting pathway to toxicity involves the oxidation of these catecholamine products by oxygen, with the formation of damaging oxygen-derived species. The action of the oxidation products of catecholamines is outlined, with special attention to the nervous and cardiac systems.	eng	391	405	Free radical biology & medicine	13	4	1992	Oct		D000818;D002395/Q000737;D002395/Q000378;D002395/Q000633;D006331/Q000139;D006801;D009422/Q000139;D010084	Animals;Catecholamines/chemistry;Catecholamines/metabolism;Catecholamines/toxicity;Heart Diseases/chemically induced;Humans;Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced;Oxidation-Reduction	Bindoli A;Rigobello MP;Deeble DJ	Journal, Articles								False
1079	8434935	The pecking order of free radicals and antioxidants: lipid peroxidation, alpha-tocopherol, and ascorbate.	Free radicals vary widely in their thermodynamic properties, ranging from very oxidizing to very reducing. These thermodynamic properties can be used to predict a pecking order, or hierarchy, for free radical reactions. Using one-electron reduction potentials, the predicted pecking order is in agreement with experimentally observed free radical electron (hydrogen atom) transfer reactions. These potentials are also in agreement with experimental data that suggest that vitamin E, the primary lipid soluble small molecule antioxidant, and vitamin C, the terminal water soluble small molecule antioxidant, cooperate to protect lipids and lipid structures against peroxidation. Although vitamin E is located in membranes and vitamin C is located in aqueous phases, vitamin C is able to recycle vitamin E; i.e., vitamin C repairs the tocopheroxyl (chromanoxyl) radical of vitamin E, thereby permitting vitamin E to function again as a free radical chain-breaking antioxidant. This review discusses: (i) the thermodynamics of free radical reactions that are of interest to the health sciences; (ii) the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic properties that are associated with chain-breaking antioxidants; (iii) the unique interfacial nature of the apparent reaction of the tocopherol free radical (vitamin E radical) and vitamin C; and (iv) presents a hierarchy, or pecking order, for free radical electron (hydrogen atom) transfer reactions.	eng	535	543	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics	300	2	1993	Feb	01	D000975/Q000737;D001205/Q000737;D005231/Q000737;D005609;D007700;D015227;D008563/Q000737;D008563/Q000378;D010084;D013816;D014810/Q000737	Antioxidants/chemistry;Ascorbic Acid/chemistry;Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/chemistry;Free Radicals;Kinetics;Lipid Peroxidation;Membrane Lipids/chemistry;Membrane Lipids/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Thermodynamics;Vitamin E/chemistry	Buettner GR	Journal, Articles								False
1080	8514774	Methyl esterification of C-terminal leucine residues in cytosolic 36-kDa polypeptides of bovine brain. A novel eucaryotic protein carboxyl methylation reaction.	Incubation of cytosolic extracts of bovine brain with S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine results in the predominant [3H]methyl esterification of a 36-kDa polypeptide. This reaction appears to be distinct from any of the three known types of protein carboxyl methylation reactions previously established. We show here that the methylated 36-kDa polypeptide is a component of a cytosolic protein with a native molecular mass estimated at 178 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. The methyl group is not stable on the protein and is lost as [3H]methanol with a half-life of about 180 min at pH 7.0, 37 degrees C. The methyltransferase responsible for this reaction is a cytosolic protein with a native molecular mass of about 40 kDa that is readily separated from the well described protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77). The methyl ester linkage is cleaved by carboxypeptidase Y, suggesting that the 36-kDa polypeptide is methylated on its C-terminal carboxyl group. Extensive digestion of gel-purified 3H-methylated 36-kDa polypeptide with trypsin and leucine aminopeptidase results in a radioactive product that co-chromatographs with authentic L-leucine methyl ester in reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography, thin layer electrophoresis, and high resolution-sulfonated polystyrene cation-exchange chromatography. Additionally, the o-phthalaldehyde/beta-mercaptoethanol-derived isoindole derivative of the 3H digestion product co-migrates on HPLC with the corresponding isoindole for L-leucine methyl ester. We demonstrate that a similar methylation system is present in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae but not in the bacterium Escherichia coli. These results provide evidence for a new type of reversible posttranslational modification reaction that may function to modulate the activities of its methyl-accepting substrates.	eng	13364	13371	The Journal of biological chemistry	268	18	1993	Jun	25	D000595;D000818;D001921/Q000378;D002417;D002853;D003600/Q000378;D004591;D004951;D007930/Q000032;D007930/Q000378;D008745;D008969;D010455/Q000737;D010455/Q000302;D010455/Q000378;D011497/Q000302;D011497/Q000378;D013379	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Brain/metabolism;Cattle;Chromatography, Liquid;Cytosol/metabolism;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Esterification;Leucine/analysis;Leucine/metabolism;Methylation;Molecular Sequence Data;Peptides/chemistry;Peptides/isolation & purification;Peptides/metabolism;Protein O-Methyltransferase/isolation & purification;Protein O-Methyltransferase/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Xie H;Clarke S	Journal, Articles								False
1081	8500767	Identity of a major 3-deoxyglucosone-reducing enzyme with aldehyde reductase in rat liver established by amino acid sequencing and cDNA expression.	We have purified a rat liver enzyme that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), a major intermediate in the Maillard reaction and a potent cross-linker responsible for the polymerization of proteins. Comparison of the amino acid (aa) sequences of nine peptides obtained from the rat 3-DG-reducing enzyme by lysylendopeptidase digestion with the aa sequence of human aldehyde reductase (ALR) [Bohren et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266 (1991) 24031-24037] strongly suggested that the purified enzyme was rat ALR. We cloned the cDNA encoding ALR from a rat kidney cDNA library using a human ALR cDNA fragment, amplified by polymerase chain reaction, as a probe. All nine peptides identified in the purified rat 3-DG-reducing enzyme were found in the aa sequence deduced from the rat ALR cDNA. Moreover, cell extract from COS-1 cells transfected with the rat ALR cDNA exhibited NADPH-dependent 3-DG-reducing activity and cross-reacted with antiserum raised against the purified rat 3-DG-reducing enzyme. All the above data indicate clearly that the 3-DG-reducing enzyme is identical with ALR. Northern blot analysis of total mRNA from a variety of rat tissues showed fairly high levels of expression of ALR mRNA. This suggests that sufficient ALR is present to detoxify 3-DG when it is formed through the Maillard reaction in vivo.	eng	249	253	Gene	127	2	1993	May	30	D000449/Q000235;D000449/Q000378;D000595;D000818;D001483;D002460;D003001;D004247/Q000235;D004247/Q000302;D003847/Q000031;D003847/Q000378;D005822;D006801;D007700;D008099/Q000201;D008969;D016133;D051381;D011994/Q000378;D013379;D014162	Aldehyde Reductase/genetics;Aldehyde Reductase/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Base Sequence;Cell Line;Cloning, Molecular;DNA/genetics;DNA/isolation & purification;Deoxyglucose/analogs & derivatives;Deoxyglucose/metabolism;Genetic Vectors;Humans;Kinetics;Liver/enzymology;Molecular Sequence Data;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Rats;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Substrate Specificity;Transfection	Takahashi M;Fujii J;Teshima T;Suzuki K;Shiba T;Taniguchi N	Journal, Articles								False

1083	8114917	Diadenosine phosphates and the physiological control of blood pressure.	Our understanding of the regulation of vascular tone has been extended since the identification of vasoactive agents such as the atrial natriuretic peptides, endothelial-derived relaxing factor and endothelin. Unidentified vasopressive agents have been found in platelets. Here we isolate these vasopressors and identify them as diadenosine pentaphosphate (AP5A) and diadenosine hexaphosphate (AP6A) by chromatography, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet spectroscopy and enzymatic cleavage. In the vasculature of isolated perfused rat kidney, both diadenosine phosphates were active at a concentration of 10(-9) M; in aortic rings, contractions were elicited at 10(-8) M. Intra-aortic injection in the rat caused a prolonged increase in blood pressure. We conclude that AP5A and AP6A may play a part in local vasoregulation and possibly in the regulation of blood pressure.	eng	186	188	Nature	367	6459	1994	Jan	13	D015720;D000469;D000818;D001011/Q000502;D001792/Q000737;D001794/Q000502;D002853;D015226/Q000302;D015226/Q000502;D005092;D066298;D007668/Q000098;D013058;D009708;D043264;D010727;D051381;D013056;D014661/Q000502	5'-Nucleotidase;Alkaline Phosphatase;Animals;Aorta/physiology;Blood Platelets/chemistry;Blood Pressure/physiology;Chromatography, Liquid;Dinucleoside Phosphates/isolation & purification;Dinucleoside Phosphates/physiology;Exonucleases;In Vitro Techniques;Kidney/blood supply;Mass Spectrometry;Nucleotidases;Phosphodiesterase I;Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases;Rats;Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet;Vasoconstriction/physiology	Schlüter H;Offers E;Brüggemann G;van der Giet M;Tepel M;Nordhoff E;Karas M;Spieker C;Witzel H;Zidek W	Journal, Articles								False
1084	8031149	The bifunctional cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase: regulation of the phosphotransferase and nucleotidase activities.	The cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase specific for IMP, GMP, and their deoxyderivatives has been purified approximately 1000 times from calf thymus. The enzyme, in the presence of a suitable nucleoside, can act as a phosphotransferase, catalyzing the transfer of the phosphate moiety from a nucleoside monophosphate donor to a nucleoside acceptor, thus operating as an interconverting activity. This phosphorylating activity has drawn the attention of several research groups because the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase represents the only cellular enzyme able to phosphorylate inosine and guanosine analogs, which are not substrates of known cellular nucleoside kinases. In this paper, we report the kinetic parameters of the bifunctional enzyme and its response to variations in adenylate energy charge. The results seem to indicate that in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP and phosphate, the enzyme behaves mainly as a phosphotransferase, its activity being dependent only on the availability of a suitable nucleoside.	eng	75	80	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics	312	1	1994	Jul		D015720/Q000187;D015720/Q000302;D015720/Q000378;D000255/Q000494;D000818;D002417;D003600/Q000201;D004734;D004789;D010710/Q000494;D010770/Q000187;D010770/Q000302;D010770/Q000378;D013379;D013950/Q000201	5'-Nucleotidase/drug effects;5'-Nucleotidase/isolation & purification;5'-Nucleotidase/metabolism;Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology;Animals;Cattle;Cytosol/enzymology;Energy Metabolism;Enzyme Activation;Phosphates/pharmacology;Phosphotransferases/drug effects;Phosphotransferases/isolation & purification;Phosphotransferases/metabolism;Substrate Specificity;Thymus Gland/enzymology	Pesi R;Turriani M;Allegrini S;Scolozzi C;Camici M;Ipata PL;Tozzi MG	Journal, Articles								False
1085	7929092	Biliverdin-IX alpha reductase and biliverdin-IX beta reductase from human liver. Purification and characterization.	This report describes for the first time the identification of four forms of biliverdin reductase including two biliverdin-IX beta reductases and two biliverdin-IX alpha reductases, designated isozymes I and II and isozymes III and IV, respectively, in human liver cytosolic fractions. The four forms of biliverdin reductase were purified to homogeneity. There was a 7,800-15,000-fold increase in specific activity when compared with the crude preparation, and the recovery was 8-26%. The purified enzymes were monomers with a molecular weight of about 21,000 (isozymes I and II) and 34,000 (isozymes III and IV). The enzymes were strictly specific for biliverdin, and no other oxidoreductase activities were detected in the purified preparations. The purified enzymes used NADPH and NADH as electron donors for the reduction of biliverdin. The apparent Km values of isozymes I, II, III, and IV for NADPH were 35.9, 13.1, 10.9, and 34.1 microM, respectively, whereas those for NADH were 5.6, 8.2, 7.9, and 23.4 mM, respectively. It was assumed that NADPH rather than NADH was the physiological electron donor in the intracellular reduction of biliverdin. The apparent Km value of isozymes I and II for biliverdin-IX beta in the NADPH system was 0.3 microM whereas those of isozymes III and IV for biliverdin-IX alpha were 1.0 and 0.8 microM, respectively. Isozymes I and II used biliverdin-IX beta, -IX gamma, and -IX delta as substrates but not biliverdin-IX alpha, and isozymes III and IV preferred biliverdin-IX alpha as the most effective substrate among the four biliverdin isomers. The NADPH-dependent enzyme activities were inhibited by substrate concentrations in excess of 3-4 microM. The NADPH-dependent enzyme activities, especially isozymes III and IV, were sensitive to SH reagents including iodoacetamide, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and N-ethylmaleimide. The optimum pH of the reaction with NADPH for isozymes I and II was 8.2 whereas that for isozymes III and IV was 7.4. The proportion of the total activity of isozymes I and II to that of isozymes III and IV was considerably higher in the fetal than in the adult liver.	eng	24343	24348	The Journal of biological chemistry	269	39	1994	Sep	30	D000328;D000595;D000818;D002848;D004591;D004795;D005333;D006801;D006863;D007527/Q000187;D007527/Q000302;D007527/Q000378;D008099/Q000196;D008099/Q000201;D008969;D010088/Q000187;D010088/Q000302;D010088/Q000378;D044925;D051381;D017208;D013439/Q000494	Adult;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Enzyme Stability;Fetus;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Isoenzymes/drug effects;Isoenzymes/isolation & purification;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Liver/embryology;Liver/enzymology;Molecular Sequence Data;Oxidoreductases/drug effects;Oxidoreductases/isolation & purification;Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Sulfhydryl Reagents/pharmacology	Yamaguchi T;Komoda Y;Nakajima H	Journal, Articles								False
1086	7544351	Biochemical characterization of a human band 4.1-related protein-tyrosine phosphatase, PTPH1.	PTPH1 is a human protein-tyrosine phosphatase with homology to the band 4.1 superfamily of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. Here, we report the purification and biochemical characterization of this enzyme from baculovirus-infected insect cells. The purified protein exhibited an apparent M(r) of 120,000 on SDS gels. The native enzyme dephosphorylated both myelin basic protein (MBP) and reduced, carboxamidomethylated, and maleylated lysozyme (RCML) but was over 5-fold more active on MBP. The Km values for the two substrates were similar (1.45 microM for MBP and 1.6 microM for RCML). Phosphorylation of PTPH1 by protein kinase C in vitro resulted in a decrease in Km but had no effect on Vmax. Removal of the NH2-terminal band 4.1 homology domain of PTPH1 by limited trypsin cleavage stimulated dephosphorylation of RCML but inhibited its activity toward MBP. The dephosphorylation of RCML by full-length PTPH1 was enhanced up to 6-fold by unphosphorylated MBP and increasing ionic strength up to 0.2 M NaCl, whereas trypsinized preparations of PTPH1 containing the isolated catalytic domain were unaffected. These results suggest that in addition to a potential role in controlling subcellular localization, the NH2-terminal band 4.1 homology domain of PTPH1 may exert a direct effect on catalytic function.	eng	20067	20072	The Journal of biological chemistry	270	34	1995	Aug	25	D000595;D000818;D016367/Q000235;D002460;D003598;D004789;D006367;D006801;D066298;D007700;D008565/Q000737;D008565/Q000235;D008565/Q000378;D008969;D008970;D009113/Q000378;D004676/Q000378;D009479;D010446/Q000235;D010446/Q000302;D054589;D017027/Q000737;D017027/Q000235;D017027/Q000378;D011994/Q000737;D011994/Q000235;D011994/Q000378;D018411;D013379	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Baculoviridae/genetics;Cell Line;Cytoskeletal Proteins;Enzyme Activation;HeLa Cells;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Membrane Proteins/chemistry;Membrane Proteins/genetics;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Molecular Weight;Muramidase/metabolism;Myelin Basic Protein/metabolism;Neuropeptides;Peptide Fragments/genetics;Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 3;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/chemistry;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins/chemistry;Recombinant Proteins/genetics;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Spodoptera;Substrate Specificity	Zhang SH;Eckberg WR;Yang Q;Samatar AA;Tonks NK	Journal, Articles								False
1087	7744824	Human thioredoxin reductase directly reduces lipid hydroperoxides by NADPH and selenocystine strongly stimulates the reaction via catalytically generated selenols.	Human placenta thioredoxin reductase (HP-TR) in the presence of NADPH-catalyzed reduction of (15S)-hydroperoxy-(5Z),(8Z),11(Z),13(E)-eicosatetraenoic acid ((15S)-HPETE) into the corresponding alcohol ((15S)-HETE). Incubation of 50 nM HP-TR and 0.5 mM NADPH with 300 microM 15-HPETE for 5 min resulted in formation of 16.5 microM 15-HETE. After 60 min, 74.7 microM 15-HPETE was reduced. The rate of the reduction of 15-HPETE by the HP-TR/NADPH peroxidase system was increased 8-fold by the presence of 2.5 microM selenocystine, a diselenide amino acid. In this case, 15-HPETE was catalytically reduced by the selenol amino acid, selenocysteine, generated from the diselenide by the HP-TR/NADPH system. To a smaller extent, selenodiglutathione or human thioredoxin also potentiated the reduction of 15-HPETE by HP-TR. Hydrogen peroxide and 15-HPETE were reduced at approximately the same rate by HP-TR, thioredoxin, and selenocystine. In contrast, t-butyl hydroperoxide was reduced at a 10-fold lower rate. Our data suggest two novel pathways for the reduction and detoxification of lipid hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxide, and organic hydroperoxides, i.e. the human thioredoxin reductase-dependent pathway and a coupled reduction in the presence of selenols or selenide resulting from the reduction of selenocystine or selenodiglutathione.	eng	11761	11764	The Journal of biological chemistry	270	20	1995	May	19	D002384;D003553/Q000031;D003553/Q000378;D005978/Q000031;D005978/Q000494;D005982/Q000378;D006801;D006861/Q000378;D006893/Q000378;D015289/Q000378;D015227/Q000187;D008054/Q000378;D048369;D020929;D008954;D009249/Q000378;D016566/Q000378;D016566/Q000494;D010084;D010545/Q000378;D010920/Q000201;D017346/Q000737;D017346/Q000378;D011505/Q000737;D011505/Q000378;D017279/Q000378;D013880/Q000494;D013879/Q000494;D020122	Catalysis;Cystine/analogs & derivatives;Cystine/metabolism;Glutathione/analogs & derivatives;Glutathione/pharmacology;Glutathione Transferase/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism;Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/metabolism;Leukotrienes/metabolism;Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects;Lipid Peroxides/metabolism;MAP Kinase Kinase 1;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases;Models, Biological;NADP/metabolism;Organoselenium Compounds/metabolism;Organoselenium Compounds/pharmacology;Oxidation-Reduction;Peroxides/metabolism;Placenta/enzymology;Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry;Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism;Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry;Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism;Selenocysteine/metabolism;Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/pharmacology;Thioredoxins/pharmacology;tert-Butylhydroperoxide	Björnstedt M;Hamberg M;Kumar S;Xue J;Holmgren A	Journal, Articles								False
1088	8831718	Substrate cycling between 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside and its monophosphate in isolated rat hepatocytes.	AICA (5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide)-riboside is taken up by isolated rat hepatocytes and converted by adenosine kinase (ATP:adenosine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.20) into AICAR (ZMP), an intermediate of the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides. We investigated if, in these cells, a cycle analogous to the adenosine-AMP substrate cycle operates between AICAriboside and ZMP. When 50 microM ITu, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase, was added to hepatocytes that had metabolized AICAriboside for 30 min, the concentration of ZMP decreased immediately. This was mirrored by a reincrease of AICAriboside. Rates of the ITu-induced decrease of ZMP and the increase of AICAriboside, calculated at different concentrations of ZMP, were first order, up to the highest concentration of ZMP (approx. 5 mumol/g of cells). Dephosphorylation of ZMP added to crude cytosolic extracts of rat liver displayed hyperbolic kinetics, with a Vmax of 0.65 mumol/min per g protein and an apparent Km of 5 mM, and was markedly inhibited by Pi, an inhibitor of IMP-GMP 5'-nucleotidase (5'-ribonucleotide phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.5). We conclude that hepatocyte ZMP is continuously dephosphorylated, most likely by IMP-GMP 5'-nucleotidase, into AICAriboside, which is rephosphorylated into ZMP by adenosine kinase. Substrate cycling was also shown to occur between other nucleoside analogs and their phosphorylated counterparts.	eng	999	1006	Biochemical pharmacology	52	7	1996	Oct	11	D000620/Q000031;D000620/Q000378;D000818;D004305;D008099/Q000378;D008297;D011685/Q000378;D051381;D017208;D012263/Q000378;D013997	Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/metabolism;Animals;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Liver/metabolism;Male;Purine Nucleotides/metabolism;Rats;Rats, Wistar;Ribonucleosides/metabolism;Time Factors	Vincent MF;Bontemps F;Van den Berghe G	Journal, Articles								False
1089	8906464	Methods for the separation of lactate dehydrogenases and clinical significance of the enzyme.	Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), an ubiquitous enzyme among vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and microbes was discovered in the early period of enzymology. The enzyme has been dissolved in several distinguishable molecular forms. In mammals, three types of subunits encoded by the genes Ldh-A, Ldh-B and Ldh-C give rise to a selected number of tetrameric isoenzymes. LDH-A4, LDH-B4 and the mixed hybrid forms of the A- and B-subunits are present in many tissues but with certain distribution patterns. LDH-C4 is confined in mammals to testes and sperm. Numerous techniques have been employed to purify, characterize and separate the different forms of the enzyme. This report deals with the main protocols and procedures of purification of LDH and its isoenzymes including chromatographic and electrophoretic methods, partitioning in aqueous two-phase systems and precipitation approaches. In particular, affinity separation techniques based on natural and pseudo-biospecific ligands are described in detail. In addition, basic physico-chemical and kinetic properties of the enzyme from different sources are summarized in a second part, the clinical significance of the determination of LDH in diverse body fluids in respect to the total activity and the isoenzyme distribution in different organs is discussed.	eng	25	49	Journal of chromatography.

1091	9462881	Brain inositol monophosphatase identified as a galactose 1-phosphatase.	During the course of our analysis of myo-inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), a key enzyme of brain inositol signaling, we found it also hydrolyzes galactose 1-phosphate (Gal 1-P), an intermediate of galactose metabolism. Electrophoretically homogeneous IMPase was prepared from three different sources: (i) bovine brain, (ii) rat brain, and (iii) human brain (recombinant), which demonstrated similar ability to hydrolyze inositol monophosphates and galactose 1-phosphate. The ability of IMPase to use both inositol 1-phosphates and galactose 1-phosphate equally as substrates is of considerable importance in determining lithium's mechanism of action. Our current results suggest that during lithium therapy, both galactose and inositol metabolic pathways can be simultaneously modulated through lithium inhibition of IMPase. Enzyme studies with Mg2+ ions as activators and with Li+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Ba2+ ions as inhibitors demonstrate that IMPase is a single enzyme possessing the ability to hydrolyze both inositol monophosphates and Gal-1-P with equal efficiency. In addition, gel-filtration chromatographic analysis demonstrated that IMPase and galactose 1-phosphatase activities co-purify in our electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme preparations. Our results indicate that lithium inhibition of IMPases at clinically relevant concentrations, may modulate both inositol and galactose metabolism, and identifies yet another carbohydrate pathway utilizing IMPase.	eng	99	106	Brain research	778	1	1997	Dec	05	D000595;D000818;D001921/Q000201;D002417;D002850;D005690/Q000378;D006801;D006868;D008969;D010744/Q000032;D051381;D017207;D015398/Q000502	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Brain/enzymology;Cattle;Chromatography, Gel;Galactose/metabolism;Humans;Hydrolysis;Molecular Sequence Data;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/analysis;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Signal Transduction/physiology	Parthasarathy R;Parthasarathy L;Vadnal R	Journal, Articles								False
1092	9211192	Inborn errors of the purine nucleotide cycle: adenylosuccinase deficiency.	Adenylosuccinase catalyses two reactions in purine metabolism: the conversion of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) into aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide (AICAR) along the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides, and the conversion of adenylosuccinate (S-AMP) into AMP in the conversion of IMP into AMP. The hallmarks of adenylosuccinase deficiency are the presence of succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICAriboside) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado) in body fluids. These normally undetectable succinylpurines are the products of the dephosphorylation, by cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase, of the two substrates of adenylosuccinase. The clinical picture of the enzyme deficiency is markedly heterogeneous with, as a rule, a profound, but nevertheless variable degree of psychomotor delay, often convulsions and/or autistic features, sometimes growth retardation and muscular dystrophy. The diagnostic tests that can be used for diagnosis, the enzyme and gene defects that have been identified, and the hypotheses that have been put forward to explain the pathophysiology of the disorder are reviewed.	eng	193	202	Journal of inherited metabolic disease	20	2	1997	Jun		D000264/Q000172;D000264/Q000235;D000818;D006801;D011379;D011686/Q000175;D011686/Q000201;D011686/Q000235;D011686/Q000503	Adenylosuccinate Lyase/deficiency;Adenylosuccinate Lyase/genetics;Animals;Humans;Prognosis;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/diagnosis;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/enzymology;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/genetics;Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors/physiopathology	Van den Berghe G;Vincent MF;Jaeken J	Journal, Articles								False
1093	9367159	A new pathway for synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate.	Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2), a key molecule in the phosphoinositide signalling pathway, was thought to be synthesized exclusively by phosphorylation of PtdIns-4-P at the D-5 position of the inositol ring. The enzymes that produce PtdIns-4,5-P2 in vitro fall into two related subfamilies (type I and type II PtdInsP-5-OH kinases, or PIP(5)Ks) based on their enzymatic properties and sequence similarities'. Here we have reinvestigated the substrate specificities of these enzymes. As expected, the type I enzyme phosphorylates PtdIns-4-P at the D-5 position of the inositol ring. Surprisingly, the type II enzyme, which is abundant in some tissues, phosphorylates PtdIns-5-P at the D-4 position, and thus should be considered as a 4-OH kinase, or PIP(4)K. The earlier error in characterizing the activity of the type II enzyme is due to the presence of contaminating PtdIns-5-P in commercial preparations of PtdIns-4-P. Although PtdIns-5-P was previously thought not to exist in vivo, we find evidence for the presence of this lipid in mammalian fibroblasts, establishing a new pathway for PtdIns-4,5-P2 synthesis.	eng	192	196	Nature	390	6656	1997	Nov	13	D016475;D000818;D051379;D019269/Q000096;D018129/Q000378;D000072183;D010716/Q000378;D010744/Q000737;D010744/Q000378;D010766;D017853/Q000145;D017853/Q000378;D013379	3T3 Cells;Animals;Mice;Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate/biosynthesis;Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/metabolism;Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases;Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/chemistry;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/classification;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Rameh LE;Tolias KF;Duckworth BC;Cantley LC	Journal, Articles								False
1094	9380738	Molecular origin of cancer: catechol estrogen-3,4-quinones as endogenous tumor initiators.	Cancer is a disease that begins with mutation of critical genes: oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Our research on carcinogenic aromatic hydrocarbons indicates that depurinating hydrocarbon-DNA adducts generate oncogenic mutations found in mouse skin papillomas (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:10422, 1995). These mutations arise by mis-replication of unrepaired apurinic sites derived from the loss of depurinating adducts. This relationship led us to postulate that oxidation of the carcinogenic 4-hydroxy catechol estrogens (CE) of estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) to catechol estrogen-3,4-quinones (CE-3, 4-Q) results in electrophilic intermediates that covalently bind to DNA to form depurinating adducts. The resultant apurinic sites in critical genes can generate mutations that may initiate various human cancers. The noncarcinogenic 2-hydroxy CE are oxidized to CE-2,3-Q and form only stable DNA adducts. As reported here, the CE-3,4-Q were bound to DNA in vitro to form the depurinating adduct 4-OHE1(E2)-1(alpha,beta)-N7Gua at 59-213 micromol/mol DNA-phosphate whereas the level of stable adducts was 0.1 micromol/mol DNA-phosphate. In female Sprague-Dawley rats treated by intramammillary injection of E2-3,4-Q (200 nmol) at four mammary glands, the mammary tissue contained 2.3 micromol 4-OHE2-1(alpha, beta)-N7Gua/molDNA-phosphate. When 4-OHE1(E2) were activated by horseradish peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, or cytochrome P450, 87-440 micromol of 4-OHE1(E2)-1(alpha, beta)-N7Gua was formed. After treatment with 4-OHE2, rat mammary tissue contained 1.4 micromol of adduct/mol DNA-phosphate. In each case, the level of stable adducts was negligible. These results, complemented by other data, strongly support the hypothesis that CE-3,4-Q are endogenous tumor initiators.	eng	10937	10942	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	94	20	1997	Sep	30	D000818;D002273;D006224;D002393/Q000378;D002393/Q000502;D005260;D006801;D008297;D008647;D051379;D009369/Q000209;D010084;D011809/Q000378;D051381;D017207;D019032	Animals;Carcinogens;Cricetinae;Estrogens, Catechol/metabolism;Estrogens, Catechol/physiology;Female;Humans;Male;Mesocricetus;Mice;Neoplasms/etiology;Oxidation-Reduction;Quinones/metabolism;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization	Cavalieri EL;Stack DE;Devanesan PD;Todorovic R;Dwivedy I;Higginbotham S;Johansson SL;Patil KD;Gross ML;Gooden JK;Ramanathan R;Cerny RL;Rogan EG	Journal, Articles								False
1095	9525924	Molecular cloning of human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and reconstitution of GDP-fucose biosynthesis in vitro.	We have cloned the cDNA encoding human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, the first enzyme in the pathway converting GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose. The message is expressed in all tissues and cell lines examined, and the cDNA complements Lec13, a Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line deficient in GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase activity. The human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase polypeptide shares 61% identity with the enzyme from Escherichia coli, suggesting broad evolutionary conservation. Purified recombinant enzyme utilizes NADP+ as a cofactor and, like its E. coli counterpart, is inhibited by GDP-fucose, suggesting that this aspect of regulation is also conserved. We have isolated the product of the dehydratase reaction, GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose, and confirmed its structure by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and high field NMR. Using purified recombinant human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and FX protein (GDP-keto-6-deoxymannose 3,5-epimerase, 4-reductase), we show that the two proteins alone are sufficient to convert GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose in vitro. This unequivocally demonstrates that the epimerase and reductase activities are on a single polypeptide. Finally, we show that the two homologous enzymes from E. coli are sufficient to carry out the same enzymatic pathway in bacteria.	eng	8193	8202	The Journal of biological chemistry	273	14	1998	Apr	03	D000595;D000818;D001483;D003001;D006224;D018076/Q000235;D018076/Q000302;D004926;D006154/Q000096;D006154/Q000235;D006801;D006836/Q000235;D006836/Q000378;D008969;D016415;D014162	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Base Sequence;Cloning, Molecular;Cricetinae;DNA, Complementary/genetics;DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification;Escherichia coli;Guanosine Diphosphate Fucose/biosynthesis;Guanosine Diphosphate Fucose/genetics;Humans;Hydro-Lyases/genetics;Hydro-Lyases/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Sequence Alignment;Transfection	Sullivan FX;Kumar R;Kriz R;Stahl M;Xu GY;Rouse J;Chang XJ;Boodhoo A;Potvin B;Cumming DA	Journal, Articles								False
1096	9665850	Crystal structure of a human embryonic haemoglobin: the carbonmonoxy form of gower II (alpha2 epsilon2) haemoglobin at 2.9 A resolution.	The production of recombinant embryonic haemoglobins via a yeast expression system has enabled structural and functional studies to be conducted on these proteins. As part of a programme aimed at understanding the properties of the embryonic haemoglobins we have crystallized the human alpha2 epsilon2 (Gower II) embryonic haemoglobin in its carbonmonoxy form, and determined its structure by X-ray crystallography. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined at 2.9 A to give a final model with R-factor=0.185 and Rfree=0.235. The Gower II hemoglobin tetramer is intermediate between the adult R and R2 states, though closer to R2. The tertiary structure of the conserved alpha subunit is essentially identical when compared to that found in the adult (alpha2 beta2) and fetal (alpha2 gamma2) hemoglobins. The embryonic epsilon subunit has a structure very similar to that of the homologous adult beta and fetal gamma subunits, although with small differences at the N terminus and in the A helix. Amino acid substitutions can be identified that may play a role in the altered response of the Gower II haemoglobin to allosteric effectors, in particular chloride ions. The reduced chloride effect is thought to be the primary cause of the higher affinity of this embryonic hemoglobin in comparison to the adult molecule.	eng	475	484	Journal of molecular biology	280	3	1998	Jul	17	D006418;D006455/Q000737;D006801;D008958;D011487;D017434	Heme;Hemoglobins, Abnormal/chemistry;Humans;Models, Molecular;Protein Conformation;Protein Structure, Tertiary	Sutherland-Smith AJ;Baker HM;Hofmann OM;Brittain T;Baker EN	Journal, Articles								False
1097	9480905	Enzymic formation of riboflavin 4',5'-cyclic phosphate from FAD: evidence for a specific low-Km FMN cyclase in rat liver1.	An enzyme activity splitting FAD to AMP and riboflavin 4',5'-cyclic phosphate (4',5'-cFMN), with a Km of 6-8 microM, was partially purified from the cytosolic fraction of rat liver homogenates. 4', 5'-cFMN was characterized by enzyme, HPLC, UV-visible and NMR spectroscopic analyses. The data suggest that a novel enzyme, tentatively named FAD-AMP lyase (cyclizing) or FMN cyclase, is involved. Also, 4',5'-cFMN was hydrolysed to 5'-FMN by a rat liver cyclic phosphodiesterase. The results indicate a novel enzymic pathway for flavins in mammals, and support the biological relevance of 4',5'-cFMN, perhaps as a flavocoenzyme or a regulatory signal.	eng	881	888	The Biochemical journal	330 ( Pt 2)	Pt 2	1998	Mar	01	D000249/Q000378;D000818;D002851;D003600/Q000201;D005260;D005486/Q000031;D005486/Q000378;D005182/Q000378;D007700;D008099/Q000201;D008345/Q000378;D008956;D019761;D011755/Q000378;D051381;D017208	Adenosine Monophosphate/metabolism;Animals;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cytosol/enzymology;Female;Flavin Mononucleotide/analogs & derivatives;Flavin Mononucleotide/metabolism;Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide/metabolism;Kinetics;Liver/enzymology;Manganese/metabolism;Models, Chemical;Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases;Pyrophosphatases/metabolism;Rats;Rats, Wistar	Fraiz FJ;Pinto RM;Costas MJ;Aavalos M;Canales J;Cabezas A;Cameselle JC	Journal, Articles								False
1098	10578051	Purification, molecular cloning, and genomic organization of human brain long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase.	An acyl-CoA hydrolase, referred to as hBACH, was purified from human brain cytosol. The enzyme had a molecular mass of 100 kDa and 43-kDa subunits, and was highly active with long-chain acyl-CoAs, e.g. a maximal velocity of 295 micromol/min/mg and K(m) of 6.4 microM for palmitoyl-CoA. Acyl-CoAs with carbon chain lengths of C(8-18) were also good substrates. In human brain cytosol, 85% of palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity was titrated by an anti-BACH antibody, which accounted for over 75% of the enzyme activity found in the brain tissue. The cDNA isolated for hBACH, when expressed in Escherichia coli, directed the expression of palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity and a 44-kDa protein immunoreactive to the anti-BACH antibody, which in turn neutralized the hydrolase activity. The hBACH cDNA encoded a 338-amino acid sequence which was 95% identical to that of a rat homolog. The hBACH gene spanned about 130 kb and comprised 9 exons, and was mapped to 1p36.2 on the cytogenetic ideogram. These findings indicate that the long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase present in the brain is well conserved between man and the rat, suggesting a conserved role for this enzyme in the mammalian brain, and enabling genetic studies on the functional analysis of acyl-CoA hydrolase.	eng	1013	1019	Journal of biochemistry	126	6	1999	Dec		D000328;D000368;D000595;D000818;D001483;D001921/Q000201;D003001;D003600/Q000201;D006801;D008297;D008875;D008969;D010170/Q000235;D010170/Q000378;D051381	Adult;Aged;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Base Sequence;Brain/enzymology;Cloning, Molecular;Cytosol/enzymology;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Molecular Sequence Data;Palmitoyl-CoA Hydrolase/genetics;Palmitoyl-CoA Hydrolase/metabolism;Rats	Yamada J;Kurata A;Hirata M;Taniguchi T;Takama H;Furihata T;Shiratori K;Iida N;Takagi-Sakuma M;Watanabe T;Kurosaki K;Endo T;Suga T	Journal, Articles								False
1099	10510318	Major differences exist in the function and tissue-specific expression of human aflatoxin B1 aldehyde reductase and the principal human aldo-keto reductase AKR1 family members.	Complementary DNA clones encoding human aflatoxin B(1) aldehyde reductase (AKR7A2), aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1), aldose reductase (AKR1B1), dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 1 (AKR1C1) and chlordecone reductase (AKR1C4) have been expressed in Escherichia coli. These members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily have been purified from E. coli as recombinant proteins. The recently identified AKR7A2 was shown to differ from the AKR1 isoenzymes in being able to catalyse the reduction of 2-carboxybenzaldehyde. Also, AKR7A2 was found to exhibit a narrow substrate specificity, with activity being restricted to succinic semialdehyde (SSA), 2-nitrobenzaldehyde, pyridine-2-aldehyde, isatin, 1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ) and 9,10-phenanthrenequinone. In contrast, AKR1A1 reduces a broad spectrum of carbonyl-containing compounds, displaying highest specific activity for SSA, 4-carboxybenzaldehyde, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, pyridine-3-aldehyde, pyridine-4-aldehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, phenylglyoxal, methylglyoxal, 2,3-hexanedione, 1, 2-NQ, 16-ketoestrone and d-glucuronic acid. Comparison between the kinetic properties of AKR7A2 and AKR1A1 showed that both recombinant enzymes exhibited roughly similar k(cat)/K(m) values for SSA, 1,2-NQ and 16-ketoestrone. Many of the compounds which are substrates for AKR1A1 also serve as substrates for AKR1B1, though the latter enzyme was shown to display a specific activity significantly less than that of AKR1A1 for most of the aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes studied. Neither AKR1C1 nor AKR1C4 was found to possess high reductase activity towards aliphatic aldehydes, aromatic aldehydes, aldoses or dicarbonyls. However, unlike AKR1A1 and AKR1B1, both AKR1C1 and AKR1C4 were able to catalyse the oxidation of 1-acenaphthenol and, in addition, AKR1C4 could oxidize di- and tri-hydroxylated bile acids. Specific antibodies raised against AKR7A2, AKR1A1, AKR1B1, AKR1C1 and AKR1C4 have been used to show the presence of all of the reductases in human hepatic cytosol; the levels of AKR1B1 and AKR1C1 were markedly elevated in livers with alcohol-associated injury, and indeed AKR1B1 was only detectable in livers with evidence of alcoholic liver disease. Western blotting of extracts from brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, prostate, skeletal muscle, small intestine, spleen and testis showed that AKR7A2 is present in all of the organs examined, and AKR1B1 is similarly widely distributed in human tissues. These experiments revealed however, that the expression of AKR1A1 is restricted primarily to brain, kidney, liver and small intestine. The AKR1C family members proved not to be as widely expressed as the other reductases, with AKR1C1 being observed in only kidney, liver and testis, and AKR1C4 being found in liver alone. As human kidney is a rich source of AKR, the isoenzymes in this organ have been studied further. Anion-exchange chromatography of human renal cytosol on Q-Sepharose allowed resolution of AKR1A1, AKR1B1, AKR1C1 and AKR7A2, as identified by substrate specificity and Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry of human kidney demonstrated that AKR7A2 is expressed in a similar fashion to the AKR1 family members in proximal and distal convoluted renal tubules. Furthermore, both AKR7A2 and AKR1 members were expressed in renal carcinoma cells, suggesting that these groups of isoenzymes may be engaged in related physiological functions.	eng	487	504	The Biochemical journal	343 Pt 2	Pt 2	1999	Oct	15	D000429/Q000737;D000429/Q000235;D000429/Q000378;D000449/Q000737;D000449/Q000235;D000449/Q000378;D015153;D002384;D003001;D004351;D004926/Q000235;D006801;D007150;D007527/Q000737;D007527/Q000235;D007527/Q000378;D007668/Q000201;D007700;D008099/Q000201;D008969;D008970;D009928;D011993/Q000737;D011993/Q000378;D013379;D013816	Alcohol Oxidoreductases/chemistry;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/genetics;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Aldehyde Reductase/chemistry;Aldehyde Reductase/genetics;Aldehyde Reductase/metabolism;Blotting, Western;Catalysis;Cloning, Molecular;Drug Resistance;Escherichia coli/genetics;Humans;Immunohistochemistry;Isoenzymes/chemistry;Isoenzymes/genetics;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Kidney/enzymology;Kinetics;Liver/enzymology;Molecular Sequence Data;Molecular Weight;Organ Specificity;Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry;Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism;Substrate Specificity;Thermodynamics	O'connor T;Ireland LS;Harrison DJ;Hayes JD	Journal, Articles								False
1100	10874303	The spectrum of mutations, including four novel ones, in the thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia gene SLC19A2 of eight families.	Thiamine responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder with a triad of symptoms: megaloblastic anemia, deafness, and non-type 1 diabetes mellitus. Occasionally, cardiac abnormalities and abnormalities of the optic nerve and retina occur as well. Patients with TRMA often respond to treatment with pharmacological doses of thiamine. Recently, mutations were found in patients with TRMA in a thiamine transporter gene (SLC19A2). We here describe the mutations found in eight additional families. We found four novel mutations and three that were previously described. Of the novel ones, one is a nonsense mutation in exon 1 (E65X), two are missense mutations in exon 2 (S142F, D93H), and another is a mutation in the splicing donor site at the 5' end of intron 4 (C1223+1G>A). We also summarize the state of knowledge on all mutations found to date in TRMA patients. SLC19A2 is the first thiamine transporter gene to be described in humans. Reviewing the location and effect of the disease causing mutations can shed light on the way the protein functions and suggest ways to continue its investigation.	eng	37	42	Human mutation	16	1	2000			D000483;D000749/Q000188;D000749/Q000235;D002352/Q000235;D004252;D003638/Q000235;D003920/Q000453;D003920/Q000235;D005260;D006239/Q000235;D006801;D007438;D008297;D026901;D009154;D010375;D015183/Q000379;D013831/Q000627	Alleles;Anemia, Megaloblastic/drug therapy;Anemia, Megaloblastic/genetics;Carrier Proteins/genetics;DNA Mutational Analysis;Deafness/genetics;Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology;Diabetes Mellitus/genetics;Female;Haplotypes/genetics;Humans;Introns;Male;Membrane Transport Proteins;Mutation;Pedigree;Restriction Mapping/methods;Thiamine/therapeutic use	Raz T;Labay V;Baron D;Szargel R;Anbinder Y;Barrett T;Rabl W;Viana MB;Mandel H;Baruchel A;Cayuela JM;Cohen N	Journal, Articles								False
1101	10727395	Tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis, regeneration and functions.	Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) cofactor is essential for various processes, and is present in probably every cell or tissue of higher organisms. BH(4) is required for various enzyme activities, and for less defined functions at the cellular level. The pathway for the de novo biosynthesis of BH(4) from GTP involves GTP cyclohydrolase I, 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase and sepiapterin reductase. Cofactor regeneration requires pterin-4a-carbinolamine dehydratase and dihydropteridine reductase. Based on gene cloning, recombinant expression, mutagenesis studies, structural analysis of crystals and NMR studies, reaction mechanisms for the biosynthetic and recycling enzymes were proposed. With regard to the regulation of cofactor biosynthesis, the major controlling point is GTP cyclohydrolase I, the expression of which may be under the control of cytokine induction. In the liver at least, activity is inhibited by BH(4), but stimulated by phenylalanine through the GTP cyclohydrolase I feedback regulatory protein. The enzymes that depend on BH(4) are the phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, the latter two being the rate-limiting enzymes for catecholamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) biosynthesis, all NO synthase isoforms and the glyceryl-ether mono-oxygenase. On a cellular level, BH(4) has been found to be a growth or proliferation factor for Crithidia fasciculata, haemopoietic cells and various mammalian cell lines. In the nervous system, BH(4) is a self-protecting factor for NO, or a general neuroprotecting factor via the NO synthase pathway, and has neurotransmitter-releasing function. With regard to human disease, BH(4) deficiency due to autosomal recessive mutations in all enzymes (except sepiapterin reductase) have been described as a cause of hyperphenylalaninaemia. Furthermore, several neurological diseases, including Dopa-responsive dystonia, but also Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism and depression, have been suggested to be a consequence of restricted cofactor availability.	eng	1	16	The Biochemical journal	347 Pt 1	Pt 1	2000	Apr	01	D000429/Q000737;D000429/Q000378;D000595;D000818;D000975/Q000378;D001708/Q000031;D001708/Q000096;D001708/Q000502;D006136/Q000737;D006136/Q000378;D006801;D051379;D008958;D008969;D015394;D019761/Q000737;D019761/Q000378;D011487;D051381;D016415	Alcohol Oxidoreductases/chemistry;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Antioxidants/metabolism;Biopterins/analogs & derivatives;Biopterins/biosynthesis;Biopterins/physiology;GTP Cyclohydrolase/chemistry;GTP Cyclohydrolase/metabolism;Humans;Mice;Models, Molecular;Molecular Sequence Data;Molecular Structure;Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases/chemistry;Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases/metabolism;Protein Conformation;Rats;Sequence Alignment	Thöny B;Auerbach G;Blau N	Journal, Articles								False
1102	10783391	Identification, characterization, and crystal structure of the Omega class glutathione transferases.	A new class of glutathione transferases has been discovered by analysis of the expressed sequence tag data base and sequence alignment. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) of the new class, named Omega, exist in several mammalian species and Caenorhabditis elegans. In humans, GSTO 1-1 is expressed in most tissues and exhibits glutathione-dependent thiol transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities characteristic of the glutaredoxins. The structure of GSTO 1-1 has been determined at 2.0-A resolution and has a characteristic GST fold (Protein Data Bank entry code ). The Omega class GSTs exhibit an unusual N-terminal extension that abuts the C terminus to form a novel structural unit. Unlike other mammalian GSTs, GSTO 1-1 appears to have an active site cysteine that can form a disulfide bond with glutathione.	eng	24798	24806	The Journal of biological chemistry	275	32	2000	Aug	11	D000595;D000818;D001483;D017173/Q000201;D018360;D005260;D005982/Q000737;D005982/Q000235;D005982/Q000378;D006801;D007527/Q000737;D007527/Q000235;D007527/Q000378;D007700;D008297;D008322;D008958;D008969;D010802;D011487;D017433;D016324;D013379;D014158	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Base Sequence;Caenorhabditis elegans/enzymology;Crystallography, X-Ray;Female;Glutathione Transferase/chemistry;Glutathione Transferase/genetics;Glutathione Transferase/metabolism;Humans;Isoenzymes/chemistry;Isoenzymes/genetics;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Kinetics;Male;Mammals;Models, Molecular;Molecular Sequence Data;Phylogeny;Protein Conformation;Protein Structure, Secondary;Sequence Tagged Sites;Substrate Specificity;Transcription, Genetic	Board PG;Coggan M;Chelvanayagam G;Easteal S;Jermiin LS;Schulte GK;Danley DE;Hoth LR;Griffor MC;Kamath AV;Rosner MH;Chrunyk BA;Perregaux DE;Gabel CA;Geoghegan KF;Pandit J	Journal, Articles								False
1103	10675562	A novel target of lithium therapy.	Phosphatases converting 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) into adenosine 5'-phosphate are of fundamental importance in living cells as the accumulation of PAP is toxic to several cellular systems. These enzymes are lithium-sensitive and we have characterized a human PAP phosphatase as a potential target of lithium therapy. A cDNA encoding a human enzyme was identified by data base screening, expressed in Escherichia coli and the 33 kDa protein purified to homogeneity. The enzyme exhibits high affinity for PAP (K(m)<1 microM) and is sensitive to subtherapeutic concentrations of lithium (IC(50)=0.3 mM). The human enzyme also hydrolyzes inositol-1, 4-bisphosphate with high affinity (K(m)=0.4 microM), therefore it can be considered as a dual specificity enzyme with high affinity (microM range) for both PAP and inositol-1,4-bisphosphate. Hydrolysis of inositol-1,4-bisphosphate was also inhibited by lithium (IC(50)=0.6 mM). Thus, we present experimental evidence for a novel target of lithium therapy, which could explain some of the side effects of this therapy.	eng	321	325	FEBS letters	467	2-3	2000	Feb	11	D000244/Q000378;D000249/Q000378;D000595;D001483;D002851;D003001;D018076/Q000737;D004926;D020224;D006801;D008094/Q000494;D008094/Q000627;D008094/Q000633;D008969;D009708/Q000737;D009708/Q000235;D009708/Q000378;D010744/Q000378;D012441	Adenosine Diphosphate/metabolism;Adenosine Monophosphate/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Base Sequence;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Cloning, Molecular;DNA, Complementary/chemistry;Escherichia coli;Expressed Sequence Tags;Humans;Lithium/pharmacology;Lithium/therapeutic use;Lithium/toxicity;Molecular Sequence Data;Nucleotidases/chemistry;Nucleotidases/genetics;Nucleotidases/metabolism;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism;Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Yenush L;Bellés JM;López-Coronado JM;Gil-Mascarell R;Serrano R;Rodríguez PL	Journal, Articles								False
1104	10620517	Initial-rate kinetics of the flavin reductase reaction catalysed by human biliverdin-IXbeta reductase (BVR-B).	The initial-rate kinetics of the flavin reductase reaction catalysed by biliverdin-IXbeta reductase at pH 7.5 are consistent with a rapid-equilibrium ordered mechanism, with the pyridine nucleotide binding first. NADPH binding to the free enzyme was characterized using stopped-flow fluorescence quenching, and a K(d) of 15.8 microM was calculated. Equilibrium fluorescence quenching experiments indicated a K(d) of 0.55 microM, suggesting that an enzyme-NADPH encounter complex (K(d) 15.8 microM) isomerizes to a more stable 'nucleotide-induced' conformation. The enzyme was shown to catalyse the reduction of FMN, FAD and riboflavin, with K(m) values of 52 microM, 125 microM and 53 microM, respectively. Lumichrome was shown to be a competitive inhibitor against FMN, with a K(i) of 76 microM, indicating that interactions with the isoalloxazine ring are probably sufficient for binding. During initial experiments it was observed that both the flavin reductase and biliverdin reductase activities of the enzyme exhibit a sharp optimum at pH 5 in citrate buffer. An initial-rate study indicated that the enzyme obeys a steady-state ordered mechanism in this buffer. The initial-rate kinetics in sodium acetate at pH 5 are consistent with a rapid-equilibrium ordered mechanism, indicating that citrate may directly affect the enzyme's behaviour at pH 5. Mesobiliverdin XIIIalpha, a synthetic biliverdin which binds to flavin reductase but does not act as a substrate for the enzyme, exhibits competitive kinetics with FMN (K(i) 0.59 microM) and mixed-inhibition kinetics with NADPH. This is consistent with a single pyridine nucleotide site and competition by FMN and biliverdin for a second site. Interestingly, flavin reductase/biliverdin-IXbeta reductase has also been shown to exhibit ferric reductase activity, with an apparent K(m) of 2.5 microM for the ferric iron. The ferric reductase reaction requires NAD(P)H and FMN. This activity is intriguing, as haem cleavage in the foetus produces non-alpha isomers of biliverdin and ferric iron, both of which are substrates for flavin reductase/biliverdin-IXbeta reductase.	eng	393	399	The Biochemical journal	345 Pt 2	Pt 2	2000	Jan	15	D000332;D001664/Q000031;D001664/Q000378;D038181;D005415/Q000378;D006418/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008956;D009247/Q000037;D009247/Q000378;D009249/Q000378;D010088/Q000037;D010088/Q000378;D044925;D013237;D013379	Aerobiosis;Biliverdine/analogs & derivatives;Biliverdine/metabolism;FMN Reductase;Flavins/metabolism;Heme/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Models, Chemical;NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors;NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/metabolism;NADP/metabolism;Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors;Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors;Stereoisomerism;Substrate Specificity	Cunningham O;Gore MG;Mantle TJ	Journal, Articles								False
1105	11281297	The heme synthesis and degradation pathways: role in oxidant sensitivity. Heme oxygenase has both pro- and antioxidant properties.	The heme biosynthetic and catabolic pathways generate pro- and antioxidant compounds, and consequently, influence cellular sensitivity to oxidants. Heme precursors (delta-aminolevulinic acid, porphyrins) generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), from autoxidation and photochemical reactions, respectively. Heme, an essential iron chelate, serves in respiration, oxygen transport, detoxification, and signal transduction processes. The potential toxicity of heme and hemoproteins points to a critical role for heme degradation in cellular metabolism. The heme oxygenases (HOs) provide this function and participate in cellular defense. This hypothesis emerges from the observation that the activation of HO-1 is an ubiquitous cellular response to oxidative stress. The reaction products of HO activity, biliverdin, and its subsequent metabolite bilirubin, have antioxidant properties. Furthermore, iron released from HO activity stimulates ferritin synthesis, which ultimately provides an iron detoxification mechanism that may account for long-term cytoprotection observed after HO induction. However, such models have overlooked potential pro-oxidant consequences of HO activity. The HO reaction releases iron, which could be involved in deleterious reactions that compete with iron reutilization and sequestration pathways. Indeed, the induction of HO activity may have both pro- and antioxidant sequelae depending on cellular redox potential, and the metabolic fate of the heme iron.	eng	289	309	Free radical biology & medicine	28	2	2000	Jan	15	D000622/Q000378;D000818;D006418/Q000096;D006418/Q000378;D006419/Q000378;D006420/Q000378;D006801;D015227;D008322;D008956;D016877/Q000633;D010084;D018384;D011166/Q000378;D017382/Q000502	Aminolevulinic Acid/metabolism;Animals;Heme/biosynthesis;Heme/metabolism;Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/metabolism;Hemeproteins/metabolism;Humans;Lipid Peroxidation;Mammals;Models, Chemical;Oxidants/toxicity;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Porphyrins/metabolism;Reactive Oxygen Species/physiology	Ryter SW;Tyrrell RM	Journal, Articles								False
1106	10820226	Molecular cloning of a novel brain-type Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransporter.	We have isolated a human cDNA encoding a protein, designated DNPI, that shows 82% amino acid identity and 92% similarity to the human brain-specific Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate (Na(+)/P(i)) cotransporter (BNPI), which is localized exclusively to neuron-rich regions. Expression of DNPI mRNA in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a significant increase in Na(+)-dependent P(i) transport, indicating that DNPI is a novel Na(+)/P(i) cotransporter. Northern blot analysis shows that DNPI mRNA is expressed predominantly in brain, where the highest levels are observed in medulla, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus, all of which express BNPI mRNA at low levels. In contrast, DNPI mRNA is expressed at low levels in cerebellum and hippocampus, where BNPI mRNA is expressed at high levels. No hybridizing signal for DNPI mRNA is observed in the glia-rich region of corpus callosum. In other regions examined, both mRNAs are moderately or highly expressed. These results indicate that BNPI and DNPI, which coordinate Na(+)-dependent P(i) transport in the neuron-rich regions of the brain, may form a new class within the Na(+)/P(i) cotransporter family.	eng	2622	2625	Journal of neurochemistry	74	6	2000	Jun		D000818;D015152;D001923/Q000235;D002352/Q000235;D002352/Q000378;D003001;D018076/Q000302;D015870/Q000502;D015723;D006801;D008969;D009865/Q000502;D010710/Q000378;D010761;D012333/Q000032;D051381;D017386;D012964/Q000378;D050608;D027981;D014982	Animals;Blotting, Northern;Brain Chemistry/genetics;Carrier Proteins/genetics;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cloning, Molecular;DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification;Gene Expression/physiology;Gene Library;Humans;Molecular Sequence Data;Oocytes/physiology;Phosphates/metabolism;Phosphorus Radioisotopes;RNA, Messenger/analysis;Rats;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Sodium/metabolism;Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins;Symporters;Xenopus laevis	Aihara Y;Mashima H;Onda H;Hisano S;Kasuya H;Hori T;Yamada S;Tomura H;Yamada Y;Inoue I;Kojima I;Takeda J	Journal, Articles								False
1107	10749855	Cloning and expression of the human N-acetylneuraminic acid phosphate synthase gene with 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero- D-galacto-nononic acid biosynthetic ability.	Sialic acids participate in many important biological recognition events, yet eukaryotic sialic acid biosynthetic genes are not well characterized. In this study, we have identified a novel human gene based on homology to the Escherichia coli sialic acid synthase gene (neuB). The human gene is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a 40-kDa enzyme. The gene partially restores sialic acid synthase activity in a neuB-negative mutant of E. coli and results in N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN) production in insect cells upon recombinant baculovirus infection. In vitro the human enzyme uses N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate and mannose 6-phosphate as substrates to generate phosphorylated forms of Neu5Ac and KDN, respectively, but exhibits much higher activity toward the Neu5Ac phosphate product.	eng	17869	17877	The Journal of biological chemistry	275	23	2000	Jun	09	D000595;D003001;D004926/Q000201;D004926/Q000235;D006801;D008969;D007652/Q000235;D007652/Q000378;D011994/Q000737;D011994/Q000378;D016415;D017386;D013379;D013400/Q000378	Amino Acid Sequence;Cloning, Molecular;Escherichia coli/enzymology;Escherichia coli/genetics;Humans;Molecular Sequence Data;Oxo-Acid-Lyases/genetics;Oxo-Acid-Lyases/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins/chemistry;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Substrate Specificity;Sugar Acids/metabolism	Lawrence SM;Huddleston KA;Pitts LR;Nguyen N;Lee YC;Vann WF;Coleman TA;Betenbaugh MJ	Journal, Articles								False
1108	10858451	Studies on the specificity of the tetrapyrrole substrate for human biliverdin-IXalpha reductase and biliverdin-IXbeta reductase. Structure-activity relationships define models for both active sites.	"A comparison of the initial rate kinetics for human biliverdin-IXalpha reductase and biliverdin-IXbeta reductase with a series of synthetic biliverdins with propionate side chains ""moving"" from a bridging position across the central methene bridge (alpha isomers) to a ""gamma-configuration"" reveals characteristic behavior that allows us to propose distinct models for the two active sites. For human biliverdin-IXalpha reductase, as previously discussed for the rat and ox enzymes, it appears that at least one ""bridging propionate"" is necessary for optimal binding and catalytic activity, whereas two are preferred. All other configurations studied were substrates for human biliverdin-IXalpha reductase, albeit poor ones. In the case of mesobiliverdin-XIIIalpha, extending the propionate side chains to hexanoate resulted in a significant loss of activity, whereas the butyrate derivative retained high activity. For human biliverdin-IXalpha reductase, we suggest that a pair of positively charged side chains play a key role in optimally binding the IXalpha isomers. In the case of human biliverdin-IXbeta reductase, the enzyme cannot tolerate even one propionate in the bridging position, suggesting that two negatively charged residues on the enzyme surface may preclude productive binding in this case. The flavin reductase activity of biliverdin-IXbeta reductase is potently inhibited by mesobiliverdin-XIIIalpha and protohemin, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the tetrapyrrole and flavin substrate bind at a common site."	eng	19009	19017	The Journal of biological chemistry	275	25	2000	Jun	23	D000818;D001483;D001665;D017931;D006801;D066298;D007700;D010088/Q000378;D044925;D011758/Q000378;D051381;D011994/Q000378;D013329;D013379;D045725	Animals;Base Sequence;Binding Sites;DNA Primers;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Kinetics;Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors;Pyrroles/metabolism;Rats;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Structure-Activity Relationship;Substrate Specificity;Tetrapyrroles	Cunningham O;Dunne A;Sabido P;Lightner D;Mantle TJ	Journal, Articles								False

"Proteins containing the Nudix box ""GX(5)EX(7)REUXEEXGU"" (where U is usually Leu, Val, or Ile) are Nudix hydrolases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of a variety of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. Here we report cloning and characterization of a human cDNA encoding a novel nudix hydrolase NUDT5 for the hydrolysis of ADP-sugars. The deduced amino acid sequence of NUDT5 contains 219 amino acids, including a conserved Nudix box sequence. The recombinant NUDT5 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. At the optimal pH of 7, the purified recombinant NUDT5 catalyzed hydrolysis of two major substrates ADP-ribose and ADP-mannose with K(m) values of 32 and 83 microM, respectively; the V(max) for ADP-mannose was about 1.5 times that with ADP-ribose. The murine NUDT5 homolog was also cloned and characterized. mNudT5 has 81% amino acid identity to NUDT5 with catalytic activities similar to NUDT5 under the optimal pH of 9. Both NUDT5 and mNudT5 transcripts were ubiquitously expressed in tissues analyzed with preferential abundance in liver. The genomic structures of both NUDT5 and mNudT5 were determined and located on human chromosome 10 and mouse chromosome 2, respectively. The role of NUDT5 in maintaining levels of free ADP-ribose in cells is discussed."	eng	8844	8853	The Journal of biological chemistry	275	12	2000	Mar	24	D000246/Q000378;D000247/Q000378;D020816;D000595;D000818;D001426/Q000235;D001483;D002874;D002879;D003001;D017124;D004926/Q000235;D029968;D005816;D006801;D051379;D008969;D005810;D010744/Q000235;D010802;D011755/Q000145;D011755/Q000235;D011755/Q000302;D011994/Q000302;D017386;D013379	Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Adenosine Diphosphate Sugars/metabolism;Amino Acid Motifs;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Bacterial Proteins/genetics;Base Sequence;Chromosome Mapping;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10;Cloning, Molecular;Conserved Sequence;Escherichia coli/genetics;Escherichia coli Proteins;Genetic Complementation Test;Humans;Mice;Molecular Sequence Data;Multigene Family;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics;Phylogeny;Pyrophosphatases/classification;Pyrophosphatases/genetics;Pyrophosphatases/isolation & purification;Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Substrate Specificity	Yang H;Slupska MM;Wei YF;Tai JH;Luther WM;Xia YR;Shih DM;Chiang JH;Baikalov C;Fitz-Gibbon S;Phan IT;Conrad A;Miller JH	Journal, Articles								False
1110	11005765	Mechanism(s) of butyrate transport in Caco-2 cells: role of monocarboxylate transporter 1.	The short-chain fatty acid butyrate was readily taken up by Caco-2 cells. Transport exhibited saturation kinetics, was enhanced by low extracellular pH, and was Na(+) independent. Butyrate uptake was unaffected by DIDS; however, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate and the butyrate analogs propionate and L-lactate significantly inhibited uptake. These results suggest that butyrate transport by Caco-2 cells is mediated by a transporter belonging to the monocarboxylate transporter family. We identified five isoforms of this transporter, MCT1, MCT3, MCT4, MCT5, and MCT6, in Caco-2 cells by PCR, and MCT1 was found to be the most abundant isoform by RNase protection assay. Transient transfection of MCT1, in the antisense orientation, resulted in significant inhibition of butyrate uptake. The cells fully recovered from this inhibition by 5 days after transfection. In conclusion, our data showed that the MCT1 transporter may play a major role in the transport of butyrate into Caco-2 cells.	eng	G775	G780	American journal of physiology.

Also, .UH- is reduced by flavonoids, quercetin and rutin in CTAB micelles at rate constants of 6 x 10(6) M-1s-1 and 1 x 10(6) M-1s-1, respectively.

1114	11747442	The role of beta chains in the control of the hemoglobin oxygen binding function: chimeric human/mouse proteins, structure, and function.	By using transgenic methodologies, we have produced a number of mouse/human chimeric hemoglobins containing adult mouse and human embryonic globin chains. A detailed analysis of the oxygen binding properties of these proteins identifies the dominant role played by the specific beta-type globin chains in the control of the oxygen binding characteristics. Further analysis traces the origins of these effects to alterations in the properties of the T states of these proteins. The human zeta/mouse beta chimeric protein has been crystallized, and its structure has been determined by X-ray diffraction to a resolution of 2.1 A with R (R(free)) values of 21.6% (24.9%). Close examination of the structure indicates that the subunit interfaces contain contacts which, although different from those present in either the parent human or the parent mouse proteins, retain the overall stabilizing interactions seen in other R state hemoglobins.	eng	15669	15675	Biochemistry	40	51	2001	Dec	25	D000328;D000818;D018360;D005914/Q000737;D005914/Q000235;D005914/Q000378;D005914/Q000502;D006454/Q000737;D006454/Q000235;D006454/Q000378;D006454/Q000502;D006801;D051379;D008822;D008958;D010100/Q000378;D011485/Q000235;D011993/Q000737;D011993/Q000502;D012984;D013329	Adult;Animals;Crystallography, X-Ray;Globins/chemistry;Globins/genetics;Globins/metabolism;Globins/physiology;Hemoglobins/chemistry;Hemoglobins/genetics;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Hemoglobins/physiology;Humans;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Models, Molecular;Oxygen/metabolism;Protein Binding/genetics;Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry;Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology;Software;Structure-Activity Relationship	Kidd RD;Russell JE;Watmough NJ;Baker EN;Brittain T	Journal, Articles								False
1115	11038362	Impact of the reduced folate carrier on the accumulation of active thiamin metabolites in murine leukemia cells.	The thiamin transporter encoded by SLC19A2 and the reduced folate carrier (RFC1) share 40% homology at the protein level, but the thiamin transporter does not mediate transport of folates. By using murine leukemia cell lines that express no, normal, or high levels of RFC1, we demonstrate that RFC1 does not mediate thiamin influx. However, high level RFC1 expression substantially reduced accumulation of the active thiamin coenzyme, thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP). This decreased level of TPP, synthesized intracellularly from imported thiamin, resulted from RFC1-mediated efflux of TPP. This conclusion was supported by the following observations. (i) Efflux of intracellular TPP was increased in cells with high expression of RFC1. (ii) Methotrexate inhibits TPP influx. (iii) TPP competitively inhibits methotrexate influx. (iv) Loading cells, which overexpress RFC1 to high levels of methotrexate to inhibit competitively RFC1-mediated TPP efflux, augment TPP accumulation. (v) There was an inverse correlation between thiamin accumulation and RFC1 activity in cells grown at a physiological concentration of thiamin. The modulation of thiamin accumulation by RFC1 in murine leukemia cells suggests that this carrier may play a role in thiamin homeostasis and could serve as a modifying factor in thiamin nutritional deficiency as well as when the high affinity thiamin transporter is mutated.	eng	1114	1118	The Journal of biological chemistry	276	2	2001	Jan	12	D000818;D001692;D002352/Q000235;D002352/Q000378;D007700;D007939/Q000378;D008565/Q000235;D008565/Q000378;D026901;D008727/Q000493;D051379;D016296;D011994/Q000378;D013831/Q000031;D013831/Q000378;D013835/Q000378;D014162;D014407	Animals;Biological Transport;Carrier Proteins/genetics;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Kinetics;Leukemia L1210/metabolism;Membrane Proteins/genetics;Membrane Proteins/metabolism;Membrane Transport Proteins;Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics;Mice;Mutagenesis;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Thiamine/analogs & derivatives;Thiamine/metabolism;Thiamine Pyrophosphate/metabolism;Transfection;Tumor Cells, Cultured	Zhao R;Gao F;Wang Y;Diaz GA;Gelb BD;Goldman ID	Journal, Articles								False
1116	11772241	Aminolevulinic acid: pharmacological profile and clinical indication.	The role of aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (ALA) in photodynamic therapy (PDT) of in situ neoplasias and tumours of epithelial tumours is steadily increasing and it has been shown to be the drug with most clinical use in PDT. In dermatology, topical PDT with ALA is already postulated to be the treatment of choice for actinic keratoses and superficial basal cell carcinomas. In gastroenterology, pulmonology, uro- and nephrology, neurology and gynaecology ALA has an important role as a photosensitiser not only in the diagnosis of neoplastic tissue but as therapy; first experiences have been made with PDT in these organs. Besides the therapeutic efficacy of this technique, the fluorescence of ALA-induced porphyrins can be effectively used to detect and delineate epithelial and endothelial neoplasms. In dermatology, other indications for ALA-treatment are non-tumoural applications, especially psoriasis, viral-induced diseases, or acne vulgaris. ALA is an effective compound in the diagnosis or therapy of various epithelial and endothelial neoplastic lesions.	eng	1139	1156	Expert opinion on investigational drugs	10	6	2001	Jun		D000622/Q000737;D000622/Q000494;D000622/Q000627;D002280/Q000175;D002280/Q000188;D002986/Q000379;D002986/Q000706;D004341/Q000379;D004341/Q000706;D006801;D010778/Q000379;D017319/Q000737;D017319/Q000494;D017319/Q000627;D012878/Q000175;D012878/Q000188	Aminolevulinic Acid/chemistry;Aminolevulinic Acid/pharmacology;Aminolevulinic Acid/therapeutic use;Carcinoma, Basal Cell/diagnosis;Carcinoma, Basal Cell/drug therapy;Clinical Trials as Topic/methods;Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data;Drug Evaluation/methods;Drug Evaluation/statistics & numerical data;Humans;Photochemotherapy/methods;Photosensitizing Agents/chemistry;Photosensitizing Agents/pharmacology;Photosensitizing Agents/therapeutic use;Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis;Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy	Lang K;Lehmann P;Bolsen K;Ruzicka T;Fritsch C	Journal, Articles								False
1117	11744399	Pulse radiolysis studies of ortho-quinone chemistry relevant to melanogenesis.	The contributions of pulse radiolysis towards characterisation of unstable ortho-quinones relevant to melanogenesis are reviewed. The quinones discussed include dopaquinone, the precursor of both eumelanogenesis and phaeomelanogenesis, and 5-S-cysteinyldopaquinone, an early component of the phaeomelanogenic pathway. Redox exchange between dopaquinone and 5-S-cysteinyldopa is shown to be a determinant of the balance between eumelanogenesis and phaeomelanogenesis. Ortho-quinones resulting from the oxidation of tertiary N,N-dialkylcatecholamines cyclise to redox-inactive betaines which fail to autoactivate tyrosinase. This is consistent with the dopa detected during melanogenesis catalysed by tyrosinase being formed indirectly by a combination of dopaquinone intramolecular reductive addition to form leucodopachrome (cyclodopa), followed by redox exchange between remaining dopaquinone and leucodopachrome. Rapid tautomerism of the ortho-quinone of 4-cyanomethylcatechol to a redox-inactive quinomethane likewise inhibits tyrosinase autoactivation. The incorporation of trihydric phenol moieties in melanin is modelled by the reactions of several ortho-quinones with phloroglucinol, which itself is not directly oxidised by tyrosinase due to the meta-positioning of the hydroxyl groups. The importance of a susceptibility towards nucleophilic attack as well as a propensity to undergo redox-exchange, in the chemistry of melanogenic ortho-quinones, is emphasised.	eng	123	135	Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

1118	11564694	Thyroid hormone transport by the heterodimeric human system L amino acid transporter.	Transport of thyroid hormone across the cell membrane is required for thyroid hormone action and metabolism. We have investigated the possible transport of iodothyronines by the human system L amino acid transporter, a protein consisting of the human 4F2 heavy chain and the human LAT1 light chain. Xenopus oocytes were injected with the cRNAs coding for human 4F2 heavy chain and/or human LAT1 light chain, and after 2 d were incubated at 25 C with 0.01-10 microM [(125)I]T(4), [(125)I]T(3), [(125)I]rT(3), or [(125)I]3,3'-diiodothyronine or with 10-100 microM [(3)H]arginine, [(3)H]leucine, [(3)H]phenylalanine, [(3)H]tyrosine, or [(3)H]tryptophan. Injection of human 4F2 heavy chain cRNA alone stimulated the uptake of leucine and arginine due to dimerization of human 4F2 heavy chain with an endogenous Xenopus light chain, but did not affect the uptake of other ligands. Injection of human LAT1 light chain cRNA alone did not stimulate the uptake of any ligand. Coinjection of cRNAs for human 4F2 heavy chain and human LAT1 light chain stimulated the uptake of phenylalanine > tyrosine > leucine > tryptophan (100 microM) and of 3,3'-diiodothyronine > rT(3) approximately T(3) > T(4) (10 nM), which in all cases was Na(+) independent. Saturation analysis provided apparent Michaelis constant (K(m)) values of 7.9 microM for T(4), 0.8 microM for T(3), 12.5 microM for rT(3), 7.9 microM for 3,3'-diiodothyronine, 46 microM for leucine, and 19 microM for tryptophan. Uptake of leucine, tyrosine, and tryptophan (10 microM) was inhibited by the different iodothyronines (10 microM), in particular T(3). Vice versa, uptake of 0.1 microM T(3) was almost completely blocked by coincubation with 100 microM leucine, tryptophan, tyrosine, or phenylalanine. Our results demonstrate stereospecific Na(+)-independent transport of iodothyronines by the human heterodimeric system L amino acid transporter.	eng	4339	4348	Endocrinology	142	10	2001	Oct		D000596/Q000378;D000818;D015703/Q000378;D001692;D002352/Q000378;D027261;D006801;D013963/Q000378;D014981	Amino Acids/metabolism;Animals;Antigens, CD/metabolism;Biological Transport;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Fusion Regulatory Protein-1;Humans;Thyroid Hormones/metabolism;Xenopus	Friesema EC;Docter R;Moerings EP;Verrey F;Krenning EP;Hennemann G;Visser TJ	Journal, Articles								False
1119	11559542	Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-mediated metabolism of catechol estrogens: comparison of wild-type and variant COMT isoforms.	The oxidative metabolism of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) to catechol estrogens (2-OHE2, 4-OHE2, 2-OHE1, and 4-OHE1) and estrogen quinones has been postulated to be a factor in mammary carcinogenesis. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) catalyzes the methylation of catechol estrogens to methoxy estrogens, which simultaneously lowers the potential for DNA damage and increases the concentration of 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeOE2), an antiproliferative metabolite. We expressed two recombinant forms of COMT, the wild-type (108Val) and a common variant (108Met), to determine whether their catalytic efficiencies differ with respect to catechol estrogen inactivation. The His-tagged proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilo-triacetic acid chromatography and analyzed by electrophoresis and Western immunoblot. COMT activity was assessed by determining the methylation of 2-OHE2, 4-OHE2, 2-OHE1, and 4-OHE1, using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for quantitation of the respective methoxy products. In the case of 2-OHE2 and 2-OHE1, methylation occurred at 2-OH and 3-OH groups, resulting in the formation of 2-MeOE2 and 2-OH-3-MeOE2, and 2-MeOE1 and 2-OH-3-MeOE1, respectively. In contrast, in the case of 4-OHE2 and 4-OHE1, methylation occurred only at the 4-OH group, yielding 4-MeOE2 and 4-MeOE1, respectively. Individual and competition experiments revealed the following order of product formation: 4-MeOE2 > 4-MeOE1 >> 2-MeOE2 > 2-MeOE1 > 2-OH-3-MeOE1 > 2-OH-3-MeOE2. The variant isoform differed from wild-type COMT by being thermolabile, leading to 2-3-fold lower levels of product formation. MCF-7 breast cancer cells with the variant COMT 108Met/Met genotype also displayed 2-3-fold lower catalytic activity than ZR-75 breast cancer cells with the wild-type COMT 108Val/Val genotype. Thus, inherited alterations in COMT catalytic activity are associated with significant differences in catechol estrogen and methoxy estrogen levels and, thereby, may contribute to interindividual differences in breast cancer risk associated with estrogen-mediated carcinogenicity.	eng	6716	6722	Cancer research	61	18	2001	Sep	15	D000483;D001943/Q000201;D001943/Q000235;D002394/Q000235;D002394/Q000378;D003001;D004789;D004795;D004797;D002393/Q000378;D008401;D006801;D007527/Q000235;D007527/Q000378;D008745;D016133;D011994/Q000235;D011994/Q000378;D014407	Alleles;Breast Neoplasms/enzymology;Breast Neoplasms/genetics;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/genetics;Catechol O-Methyltransferase/metabolism;Cloning, Molecular;Enzyme Activation;Enzyme Stability;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Estrogens, Catechol/metabolism;Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry;Humans;Isoenzymes/genetics;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Methylation;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Recombinant Proteins/genetics;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Tumor Cells, Cultured	Dawling S;Roodi N;Mernaugh RL;Wang X;Parl FF	Journal, Articles								False
1120	12370170	Nudix hydrolases that degrade dinucleoside and diphosphoinositol polyphosphates also have 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) pyrophosphatase activity that generates the glycolytic activator ribose 1,5-bisphosphate.	A total of 17 Nudix hydrolases were tested for their ability to hydrolyze 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). All 11 enzymes that were active toward dinucleoside polyphosphates with 4 or more phosphate groups as substrates were also able to hydrolyze PRPP, whereas the 6 that could not and that have coenzyme A, NDP-sugars, or pyridine nucleotides as preferred substrates did not degrade PRPP. The products of hydrolysis were ribose 1,5-bisphosphate and P(i). Active PRPP pyrophosphatases included the diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase (DIPP) subfamily of Nudix hydrolases, which also degrade the non-nucleotide diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. K(m) and k(cat) values for PRPP hydrolysis for the Deinococcus radiodurans DR2356 (di)nucleoside polyphosphate hydrolase, the human diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase, and human DIPP-1 (diadenosine hexaphosphate and diphosphoinositol polyphosphate hydrolase) were 1 mm and 1.5 s(-1), 0.13 mm and 0.057 s(-1), and 0.38 mm and 1.0 s(-1), respectively. Active site mutants of the Caenorhabditis elegans diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase had no activity, confirming that the same active site is responsible for nucleotide and PRPP hydrolysis. Comparison of the specificity constants for nucleotide, diphosphoinositol polyphosphate, and PRPP hydrolysis suggests that PRPP is a significant substrate for the D. radiodurans DR2356 enzyme and for the DIPP subfamily. In the latter case, generation of the glycolytic activator ribose 1,5-bisphosphate may be a new function for these enzymes.	eng	47313	47317	The Journal of biological chemistry	277	49	2002	Dec	06	D001665;D002851;D002852;D034301/Q000201;D006019;D006801;D006868;D007700;D008958;D009154;D010428/Q000737;D011485;D011994/Q000378;D013379;D013997	Binding Sites;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Chromatography, Ion Exchange;Deinococcus/enzymology;Glycolysis;Humans;Hydrolysis;Kinetics;Models, Molecular;Mutation;Pentosephosphates/chemistry;Protein Binding;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Substrate Specificity;Time Factors	Fisher DI;Safrany ST;Strike P;McLennan AG;Cartwright JL	Journal, Articles								False

The recently cloned and characterized human polyamine oxidase (PAOh1) potentially represents a new class of catabolic enzymes in the mammalian polyamine metabolic pathway capable of the efficient oxidation of polyamines. Here the discovery of three additional human PAO splice variants is reported, and the data support the fact that the human PAO gene codes for at least four isoenzymes, each of which exhibit distinctive biochemical characteristics, suggesting the existence of additional levels of complexity in polyamine catabolism.	eng	673	677	The Biochemical journal	368	Pt 3	2002	Dec	15	D017398;D000595;D002460;D003001;D018076/Q000378;D004305;D004591;D015723;D006801;D007700;D008957;D008969;D016366;D000587/Q000096;D000587/Q000235;D011073/Q000737;D014176;D020033;D017386;D013095/Q000737;D013096/Q000031;D013096/Q000737;D013379;D014158;D014407;D000097667	Alternative Splicing;Amino Acid Sequence;Cell Line;Cloning, Molecular;DNA, Complementary/metabolism;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Gene Library;Humans;Kinetics;Models, Genetic;Molecular Sequence Data;Open Reading Frames;Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/biosynthesis;Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/genetics;Polyamines/chemistry;Protein Biosynthesis;Protein Isoforms;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Spermidine/chemistry;Spermine/analogs & derivatives;Spermine/chemistry;Substrate Specificity;Transcription, Genetic;Tumor Cells, Cultured;Polyamine Oxidase	Murray-Stewart T;Wang Y;Devereux W;Casero RA	Journal, Articles								False
1122	12036927	Analysis of methotrexate and folate transport by multidrug resistance protein 4 (ABCC4): MRP4 is a component of the methotrexate efflux system.	Human MRP4 (ABCC4, MOAT-B) is a lipophilic anion transporter that is able to confer resistance to nucleotide analogues and methotrexate (MTX). We previously investigated the implications of the ability of MRP4 to confer resistance to nucleotide analogues and determined that the pump is competent in the MgATP-energized transport of cyclic nucleotides and estradiol 17beta-D-glucuronide. Here we examine the potential role of MRP4 in conferring resistance to MTX and related processes by determining the selectivity of the transporter for MTX, MTX polyglutamates, and physiological folates. In so doing, it is shown that MRP4 is active in the transport of MTX as well as the physiological folates folic acid (FA) and N(5)-formyltetrahydrofolic acid (leucovorin). MTX, FA, and leucovorin are subject to high capacity [V(max(MTX)), 0.24 +/- 0.05 nmol/mg/min; V(max (FA)), 0.68 +/- 0.14 nmol/mg/min; V(max(leucovorin)), 1.95 +/- 0.18 nmol/mg/min], low affinity [K(m(MTX)), 0.22 +/- 0.01 mM; K(m(FA)), 0.17 +/- 0.02 mM; K(m (leucovorin)), 0.64 +/- 0.23 mM] transport by MRP4. In addition, as would be expected were MRP4 a component of the MTX efflux system, its capacity to transport this agent is abrogated by the addition of a single glutamyl residue. It is also shown that glutamylation similarly affects the ability of MRP2 to transport MTX. On the basis of these transport properties, it is concluded that the efflux system for MTX includes MRP2 and MRP4, in addition to MRP1 and MRP3, and that MRP4 represents a common efflux system for both MTX and certain nucleotide analogues.	eng	3144	3150	Cancer research	62	11	2002	Jun	01	D000818;D000964/Q000493;D016367/Q000235;D002352/Q000378;D002460;D058973;D005492/Q000493;D007313/Q000166;D007313/Q000378;D007313/Q000821;D018374/Q000378;D008081;D008727/Q000031;D008727/Q000493;D027425/Q000235;D027425/Q000378;D009995;D011099/Q000031;D011099/Q000493;D011956;D013552;D014162	Animals;Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics;Baculoviridae/genetics;Carrier Proteins/metabolism;Cell Line;Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored;Folic Acid/pharmacokinetics;Insecta/cytology;Insecta/metabolism;Insecta/virology;LLC-PK1 Cells/metabolism;Liposomes;Methotrexate/analogs & derivatives;Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism;Osmosis;Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives;Polyglutamic Acid/pharmacokinetics;Receptors, Cell Surface;Swine;Transfection	Chen ZS;Lee K;Walther S;Raftogianis RB;Kuwano M;Zeng H;Kruh GD	Journal, Articles								False
1123	11923312	Complete reconstitution of the human coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway via comparative genomics.	The biosynthesis of CoA from pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is an essential universal pathway in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The CoA biosynthetic genes in bacteria have all recently been identified, but their counterparts in humans and other eukaryotes remained mostly unknown. Using comparative genomics, we have identified human genes encoding the last four enzymatic steps in CoA biosynthesis: phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (EC ), phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (EC ), phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (EC ), and dephospho-CoA kinase (EC ). Biological functions of these human genes were verified using a complementation system in Escherichia coli based on transposon mutagenesis. The individual human enzymes were overexpressed in E. coli and purified, and the corresponding activities were experimentally verified. In addition, the entire pathway from phosphopantothenate to CoA was successfully reconstituted in vitro using a mixture of purified recombinant enzymes. Human recombinant bifunctional phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase/dephospho-CoA kinase was kinetically characterized. This enzyme was previously suggested as a point of CoA biosynthesis regulation, and we have observed significant differences in mRNA levels of the corresponding human gene in normal and tumor cells by Northern blot analysis.	eng	21431	21439	The Journal of biological chemistry	277	24	2002	Jun	14	D015152;D002262/Q000235;D002851;D003065/Q000096;D018076/Q000378;D004926/Q000378;D005816;D020745;D016680;D016681;D015894;D006367;D006801;D007700;D008956;D008969;D009713/Q000235;D010453/Q000378;D017853/Q000235;D010957/Q000378;D017434;D012333/Q000378;D011994/Q000378;D013997;D014018	Blotting, Northern;Carboxy-Lyases/genetics;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Coenzyme A/biosynthesis;DNA, Complementary/metabolism;Escherichia coli/metabolism;Genetic Complementation Test;Genome, Archaeal;Genome, Bacterial;Genome, Fungal;Genome, Human;HeLa Cells;Humans;Kinetics;Models, Chemical;Molecular Sequence Data;Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics;Peptide Synthases/metabolism;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics;Plasmids/metabolism;Protein Structure, Tertiary;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Time Factors;Tissue Distribution	Daugherty M;Polanuyer B;Farrell M;Scholle M;Lykidis A;de Crécy-Lagard V;Osterman A	Journal, Articles								False
1124	11782468	Methylseleninate is a substrate rather than an inhibitor of mammalian thioredoxin reductase. Implications for the antitumor effects of selenium.	Biochemical and clinical evidence indicates that monomethylated selenium compounds are crucial for the tumor preventive effects of the trace element selenium and that methylselenol (CH(3)SeH) is a key metabolite. As suggested by Ganther (Ganther, H. E. (1999) Carcinogenesis 20, 1657-1666), methylselenol and its precursor methylseleninate might exert their effects by inhibition of the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase via the irreversible formation of a diselenide bridge. Here we report that methylseleninate does not act as an inhibitor of mammalian thioredoxin reductase but is in fact an excellent substrate (K(m) of 18 microm, k(cat) of 23 s(-1)), which is reduced by the enzyme according to the equation 2 NADPH + 2 H(+) + CH(3)SeO(2)H --> 2 NADP(+) + 2 H(2)O + CH(3)SeH. The selenium-containing product of this reaction was identified by mass spectrometry. Nascent methylselenol was found to efficiently reduce both H(2)O(2) and glutathione disulfide. The implications of these findings for the antitumor activity of selenium are discussed. Methylseleninate was a poor substrate not only for human glutathione reductase but also for the non-selenium thioredoxin reductases enzymes from Drosophila melanogaster and Plasmodium falciparum. This suggests that the catalytic selenocysteine residue of mammalian thioredoxin reductase is essential for methylseleninate reduction.	eng	9701	9706	The Journal of biological chemistry	277	12	2002	Mar	22	D000818;D000970/Q000494;D002384;D004228/Q000494;D004331/Q000201;D019803/Q000737;D005980/Q000378;D006801;D006861/Q000494;D007700;D013058;D051379;D008954;D008956;D016566/Q000737;D016566/Q000378;D009195/Q000378;D010920/Q000378;D010963/Q000201;D011485;D017434;D012643/Q000494;D017279/Q000737;D012834/Q000737;D013379;D013880/Q000037;D013880/Q000378;D013879/Q000378;D013997	Animals;Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology;Catalysis;Dithionitrobenzoic Acid/pharmacology;Drosophila melanogaster/enzymology;Glutathione Disulfide/chemistry;Glutathione Reductase/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology;Kinetics;Mass Spectrometry;Mice;Models, Biological;Models, Chemical;Organoselenium Compounds/chemistry;Organoselenium Compounds/metabolism;Peroxidase/metabolism;Placenta/metabolism;Plasmodium falciparum/enzymology;Protein Binding;Protein Structure, Tertiary;Selenium/pharmacology;Selenocysteine/chemistry;Silver/chemistry;Substrate Specificity;Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/antagonists & inhibitors;Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/metabolism;Thioredoxins/metabolism;Time Factors	Gromer S;Gross JH	Journal, Articles								False
1125	12198488	The structural basis for specificity in human ABO(H) blood group biosynthesis.	The human ABO(H) blood group antigens are produced by specific glycosyltransferase enzymes. An N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GTA) uses a UDP-GalNAc donor to convert the H-antigen acceptor to the A antigen, whereas a galactosyltransferase (GTB) uses a UDP-galactose donor to convert the H-antigen acceptor to the B antigen. GTA and GTB differ only in the identity of four critical amino acid residues. Crystal structures at 1.8-1.32 A resolution of the GTA and GTB enzymes both free and in complex with disaccharide H-antigen acceptor and UDP reveal the basis for donor and acceptor specificity and show that only two of the critical amino acid residues are positioned to contact donor or acceptor substrates. Given the need for stringent stereo- and regioselectivity in this biosynthesis, these structures further demonstrate that the ability of the two enzymes to distinguish between the A and B donors is largely determined by a single amino acid residue.	eng	685	690	Nature structural biology	9	9	2002	Sep		D000017;D018360;D005700/Q000096;D005700/Q000737;D005700/Q000378;D006801;D008958;D017350/Q000096;D017350/Q000737;D017350/Q000378;D011487;D013379;D014530/Q000378	ABO Blood-Group System;Crystallography, X-Ray;Galactosyltransferases/biosynthesis;Galactosyltransferases/chemistry;Galactosyltransferases/metabolism;Humans;Models, Molecular;N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases/biosynthesis;N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases/chemistry;N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases/metabolism;Protein Conformation;Substrate Specificity;Uridine Diphosphate/metabolism	Patenaude SI;Seto NO;Borisova SN;Szpacenko A;Marcus SL;Palcic MM;Evans SV	Journal, Articles								False
1126	12777395	The reported human NADsyn2 is ammonia-dependent NAD synthetase from a pseudomonad.	Nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthetases catalyze the last step in NAD+ metabolism in the de novo, import, and salvage pathways that originate from tryptophan (or aspartic acid), nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide, respectively, and converge on nicotinic acid mononucleotide. NAD+ synthetase converts nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide to NAD+ via an adenylylated intermediate. All of the known eukaryotic NAD+ synthetases are glutamine-dependent, hydrolyzing glutamine to glutamic acid to provide the attacking ammonia. In the prokaryotic world, some NAD+ synthetases are glutamine-dependent, whereas others can only use ammonia. Earlier, we noted a perfect correlation between presence of a domain related to nitrilase and glutamine dependence and then proved in the accompanying paper (Bieganowski, P., Pace, H. C., and Brenner, C. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 33049-33055) that the nitrilase-related domain is an essential, obligate intramolecular, thiol-dependent glutamine amidotransferase in the yeast NAD+ synthetase, Qns1. Independently, human NAD+ synthetase was cloned and shown to depend on Cys-175 for glutamine-dependent but not ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase activity. Additionally, it was claimed that a 275 amino acid open reading frame putatively amplified from human glioma cell line LN229 encodes a human ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase and this was speculated largely to mediate NAD+ synthesis in human muscle tissues. Here we establish that the so-called NADsyn2 is simply ammonia-dependent NAD+ synthetase from Pseudomonas, which is encoded on an operon with nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase and, in some Pseudomonads, with nicotinamidase.	eng	33056	33059	The Journal of biological chemistry	278	35	2003	Aug	29	D019732/Q000737;D019732/Q000235;D000641/Q000737;D001483;D002892/Q000378;D003001;D018899;D003545/Q000737;D004247/Q000378;D015723;D018698/Q000737;D005973/Q000737;D006801;D006868;D008969;D009132/Q000378;D009243/Q000737;D009535/Q000378;D016366;D009876;D010802;D017434;D011549/Q000378;D012689	Amide Synthases/chemistry;Amide Synthases/genetics;Ammonia/chemistry;Base Sequence;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/metabolism;Cloning, Molecular;CpG Islands;Cysteine/chemistry;DNA/metabolism;Gene Library;Glutamic Acid/chemistry;Glutamine/chemistry;Humans;Hydrolysis;Molecular Sequence Data;Muscles/metabolism;NAD/chemistry;Nicotinamidase/metabolism;Open Reading Frames;Operon;Phylogeny;Protein Structure, Tertiary;Pseudomonas/metabolism;Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid	Bieganowski P;Brenner C	Journal, Articles								False
1127	12435734	The mammalian cytosolic selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase reduces ubiquinone. A novel mechanism for defense against oxidative stress.	The selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) is an essential antioxidant enzyme known to reduce many compounds in addition to thioredoxin, its principle protein substrate. Here we found that TrxR1 reduced ubiquinone-10 and thereby regenerated the antioxidant ubiquinol-10 (Q10), which is important for protection against lipid and protein peroxidation. The reduction was time- and dose-dependent, with an apparent K(m) of 22 microm and a maximal rate of about 12 nmol of reduced Q10 per milligram of TrxR1 per minute. TrxR1 reduced ubiquinone maximally at a physiological pH of 7.5 at similar rates using either NADPH or NADH as cofactors. The reduction of Q10 by mammalian TrxR1 was selenium dependent as revealed by comparison with Escherichia coli TrxR or selenium-deprived mutant and truncated mammalian TrxR forms. In addition, the rate of reduction of ubiquinone was significantly higher in homogenates from human embryo kidney 293 cells stably overexpressing thioredoxin reductase and was induced along with increasing cytosolic TrxR activity after the addition of selenite to the culture medium. These data demonstrate that the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase is an important selenium-dependent ubiquinone reductase and can explain how selenium and ubiquinone, by a combined action, may protect the cell from oxidative damage.	eng	2141	2146	The Journal of biological chemistry	278	4	2003	Jan	24	D000818;D000931/Q000494;D000975/Q000494;D002460;D002851;D003067;D004926/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D009154;D018384;D051381;D054481;D013880/Q000378;D013880/Q000502;D013997;D014162;D014451/Q000031;D014451/Q000737;D014451/Q000378;D014451/Q000494	Animals;Antidotes/pharmacology;Antioxidants/pharmacology;Cell Line;Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid;Coenzymes;Escherichia coli/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Mutation;Oxidative Stress;Rats;Thioredoxin Reductase 1;Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/metabolism;Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/physiology;Time Factors;Transfection;Ubiquinone/analogs & derivatives;Ubiquinone/chemistry;Ubiquinone/metabolism;Ubiquinone/pharmacology	Xia L;Nordman T;Olsson JM;Damdimopoulos A;Björkhem-Bergman L;Nalvarte I;Eriksson LC;Arnér ES;Spyrou G;Björnstedt M	Journal, Articles								False
1128	12657561	Ammonium transport and pH regulation by K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporters.	The Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporters (NKCCs), which belong to the cation-Cl(-) cotransporter (CCC) family, are able to translocate NH4(+) across cell membranes. In this study, we have used the oocyte expression system to determine whether the K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporters (KCCs) can also transport NH4(+) and whether they play a role in pH regulation. Our results demonstrate that all of the CCCs examined (NKCC1, NKCC2, KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4) can promote NH4(+) translocation, presumably through binding of the ion at the K(+) site. Moreover, kinetic studies for both NKCCs and KCCs suggest that NH4(+) is an excellent surrogate of Rb(+) or K(+) and that NH4(+) transport and cellular acidification resulting from CCC activity are relevant physiologically. In this study, we have also found that CCCs are strongly and differentially affected by changes in intracellular pH (independently of intracellular [NH4(+)]). Indeed, NKCC2, KCC1, KCC2, and KCC3 are inhibited at intracellular pH <7.5, whereas KCC4 is activated. These results indicate that certain CCC isoforms may be specialized to operate in acidic environments. CCC-mediated NH4(+) transport could bear great physiological implication given the ubiquitous distribution of these carriers.	eng	F68	F78	American journal of physiology.

1129	12547821	Molecular identification of human glutamine- and ammonia-dependent NAD synthetases. Carbon-nitrogen hydrolase domain confers glutamine dependency.	NAD synthetase catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of NAD. In the present study, we obtained cDNAs for two types of human NAD synthetase (referred as NADsyn1 and NADsyn2). Structural analysis revealed in both NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 a domain required for NAD synthesis from ammonia and in only NADsyn1 an additional carbon-nitrogen hydrolase domain shared with enzymes of the nitrilase family that cleave nitriles as well as amides to produce the corresponding acids and ammonia. Consistent with the domain structures, biochemical assays indicated (i) that both NADsyn1 and NADsyn2 have NAD synthetase activity, (ii) that NADsyn1 uses glutamine as well as ammonia as an amide donor, whereas NADsyn2 catalyzes only ammonia-dependent NAD synthesis, and (iii) that mutant NADsyn1 in which Cys-175 corresponding to the catalytic cysteine residue in nitrilases was replaced with Ser does not use glutamine. Kinetic studies suggested that glutamine and ammonia serve as physiological amide donors for NADsyn1 and NADsyn2, respectively. Both synthetases exerted catalytic activity in a multimeric form. In the mouse, NADsyn1 was seen to be abundantly expressed in the small intestine, liver, kidney, and testis but very weakly in the skeletal muscle and heart. In contrast, expression of NADsyn2 was observed in all tissues tested. Therefore, we conclude that humans have two types of NAD synthetase exhibiting different amide donor specificity and tissue distributions. The ammonia-dependent synthetase has not been found in eucaryotes until this study. Our results also indicate that the carbon-nitrogen hydrolase domain is the functional domain of NAD synthetase to make use of glutamine as an amide donor in NAD synthesis. Thus, glutamine-dependent NAD synthetase may be classified as a possible glutamine amidase in the nitrilase family. Our molecular identification of NAD synthetases may prove useful to learn more of mechanisms regulating cellular NAD metabolism.	eng	10914	10921	The Journal of biological chemistry	278	13	2003	Mar	28	D019732/Q000737;D019732/Q000378;D000595;D000641/Q000378;D000818;D001483;D019556;D017931;D018076;D005973/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008969;D017386	Amide Synthases/chemistry;Amide Synthases/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Ammonia/metabolism;Animals;Base Sequence;COS Cells;DNA Primers;DNA, Complementary;Glutamine/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Molecular Sequence Data;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid	Hara N;Yamada K;Terashima M;Osago H;Shimoyama M;Tsuchiya M	Journal, Articles								False
1130	12917409	ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) binds apolipoprotein A-I and mediates cellular phospholipid but not cholesterol efflux.	ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), the defective transporter in Tangier disease, binds and promotes cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to apolipoprotein I (apoA-I). Based on a high degree of sequence homology between ABCA1 and ABCA7, a transporter of unknown function, we investigated the possibility that ABCA7 might be involved in apolipoprotein binding and lipid efflux. Similarly to cells expressing ABCA1, HEK293 cells overexpressing ABCA7 showed specific binding and cross-linking of lipid-poor apoA-I. ABCA7 expression increased cellular phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin efflux to apoA-I in a manner similar to ABCA1 but had no effect on cholesterol efflux. Western analysis showed a high protein level of ABCA7 in mouse spleen, lung, adrenal, and brain but low expression in liver. In contrast to ABCA1, ABCA7 showed moderate basal mRNA and protein levels in macrophages and lymphocytes but no induction by liver X receptor activation. These studies show that ABCA7 has the ability to bind apolipoproteins and promote efflux of cellular phospholipids without cholesterol, and they suggest a possible role of ABCA7 in cellular phospholipid metabolism in peripheral tissues.	eng	42906	42912	The Journal of biological chemistry	278	44	2003	Oct	31	D018528/Q000378;D018528/Q000502;D000311/Q000378;D000818;D016632/Q000378;D001692;D015153;D001921/Q000378;D015496/Q000378;D002460;D002478;D002784/Q000378;D004268;D004591;D005822;D006801;D050356;D008099/Q000378;D000071518;D008168/Q000378;D008214/Q000378;D008264/Q000378;D051379;D018613;D057093;D010537/Q000473;D010713/Q000378;D010743/Q000378;D010957/Q000378;D011485;D012333/Q000378;D018160/Q000378;D013109/Q000378;D013154/Q000378;D014018;D014162	ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/physiology;Adrenal Glands/metabolism;Animals;Apolipoprotein A-I/metabolism;Biological Transport;Blotting, Western;Brain/metabolism;CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism;Cell Line;Cells, Cultured;Cholesterol/metabolism;DNA-Binding Proteins;Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel;Genetic Vectors;Humans;Lipid Metabolism;Liver/metabolism;Liver X Receptors;Lung/metabolism;Lymphocytes/metabolism;Macrophages/metabolism;Mice;Microscopy, Confocal;Orphan Nuclear Receptors;Peritoneum/pathology;Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism;Phospholipids/metabolism;Plasmids/metabolism;Protein Binding;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/metabolism;Sphingomyelins/metabolism;Spleen/metabolism;Tissue Distribution;Transfection	Wang N;Lan D;Gerbod-Giannone M;Linsel-Nitschke P;Jehle AW;Chen W;Martinez LO;Tall AR	Journal, Articles								False
1131	12739169	The SLC16 gene family-from monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) to aromatic amino acid transporters and beyond.	The monocarboxylate cotransporter (MCT) family now comprises 14 members, of which only the first four (MCT1-MCT4) have been demonstrated experimentally to catalyse the proton-linked transport of metabolically important monocarboxylates such as lactate, pyruvate and ketone bodies. SLC16A10 (T-type amino-acid transporter-1, TAT1) is an aromatic amino acid transporter whilst the other members await characterization. MCTs have 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs) with intracellular N- and C-termini and a large intracellular loop between TMDs 6 and 7. MCT1 and MCT4 require a monotopic ancillary protein, CD147, for expression of functional protein at the plasma membrane. Lactic acid transport across the plasma membrane is fundamental for the metabolism of and pH regulation of all cells, removing lactic acid produced by glycolysis and allowing uptake by those cells utilizing it for gluconeogenesis (liver and kidney) or as a respiratory fuel (heart and red muscle). The properties of the different MCT isoforms and their tissue distribution and regulation reflect these roles.	eng	619	628	Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology	447	5	2004	Feb		D024322/Q000378;D000818;D001692/Q000502;D006801;D027501/Q000502;D005810/Q000502	Amino Acids, Aromatic/metabolism;Animals;Biological Transport/physiology;Humans;Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters/physiology;Multigene Family/physiology	Halestrap AP;Meredith D	Journal, Articles								False
1132	12759755	The SLC26 gene family of multifunctional anion exchangers.	The ten-member SLC26 gene family encodes anion exchangers capable of transporting a wide variety of monovalent and divalent anions. The physiological role(s) of individual paralogs is evidently due to variation in both anion specificity and expression pattern. Three members of the gene family are involved in genetic disease; SLC26A2 in chondrodysplasias, SLC26A3 in chloride-losing diarrhea, and SLC26A4 in Pendred syndrome and hereditary deafness (DFNB4). The analysis of Slc26a4-null mice has significantly enhanced the understanding of the roles of this gene in both health and disease. Targeted deletion of Slc26a5 has in turn revealed that this paralog is essential for electromotor activity of cochlear outer hair cells and thus for cochlear amplification. Anions transported by the SLC26 family, with variable specificity, include the chloride, sulfate, bicarbonate, formate, oxalate and hydroxyl ions. The functional versatility of SLC26A6 identifies it as the primary candidate for the apical Cl(-)-formate/oxalate and Cl(-)-base exchanger of brush border membranes in the renal proximal tubule, with a central role in the reabsorption of Na(+)-Cl(-) from the glomerular ultrafiltrate. At least three of the SLC26 exchangers mediate electrogenic Cl(-)-HCO(3)(-) and Cl(-)-OH(-) exchange; the stoichiometry of Cl(-)-HCO(3)(-) exchange appears to differ between SLC26 paralogs, such that SLC26A3 transports >/=2 Cl(-) ions per HCO(3)(-) ion, whereas SLC26A6 transports >/=2 HCO(3)(-) ions per Cl(-) ion. SLC26 Cl(-)-HCO(3)(-) and Cl(-)-OH(-) exchange is activated by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), implicating defective regulation of these exchangers in the reduced HCO(3)(-) transport seen in cystic fibrosis and related disorders; CFTR-independent activation of these exchangers is thus an important and novel goal for the future therapy of cystic fibrosis.	eng	710	721	Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology	447	5	2004	Feb		D000818;D027321/Q000737;D027321/Q000235;D027321/Q000378;D000838/Q000378;D017920/Q000737;D017920/Q000235;D017920/Q000378;D001692/Q000502;D006801;D005810/Q000502	Animals;Anion Transport Proteins/chemistry;Anion Transport Proteins/genetics;Anion Transport Proteins/metabolism;Anions/metabolism;Antiporters/chemistry;Antiporters/genetics;Antiporters/metabolism;Biological Transport/physiology;Humans;Multigene Family/physiology	Mount DB;Romero MF	Journal, Articles								False

1134	14706628	Structures of human purine nucleoside phosphorylase complexed with inosine and ddI.	Human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) is a ubiquitous enzyme which plays a key role in the purine salvage pathway, and PNP deficiency in humans leads to an impairment of T-cell function, usually with no apparent effect on B-cell function. PNP is highly specific for 6-oxopurine nucleosides and exhibits negligible activity for 6-aminopurine nucleosides. The catalytic efficiency for inosine is 350,000-fold greater than for adenosine. Adenine nucleosides and nucleotides are deaminated by adenosine deaminase and AMP deaminase to their corresponding inosine derivatives which, in turn, may be further degraded. Here we report the crystal structures of human PNP in complex with inosine and 2('),3(')-dideoxyinosine, refined to 2.8A resolution using synchrotron radiation. The present structures provide explanation for ligand binding, refine the purine-binding site, and can be used for future inhibitor design.	eng	907	914	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	313	4	2004	Jan	23	D001665;D018360;D016049/Q000737;D006801;D066298;D007288/Q000737;D008024;D046911;D008958;D011487;D011683/Q000737;D011994/Q000737	Binding Sites;Crystallography, X-Ray;Didanosine/chemistry;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Inosine/chemistry;Ligands;Macromolecular Substances;Models, Molecular;Protein Conformation;Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/chemistry;Recombinant Proteins/chemistry	Canduri F;dos Santos DM;Silva RG;Mendes MA;Basso LA;Palma MS;de Azevedo WF;Santos DS	Journal, Articles								False
1135	15117945	The Human hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase (HAGH) gene encodes both cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of glyoxalase II.	In yeast and higher plants, separate genes encode the cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of glyoxalase II. In contrast, although glyoxalase II activity has been detected both in the cytosol and mitochondria of mammals, only a single gene encoding glyoxalase II has been identified. Previously it was thought that this gene (the hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase gene), comprised 8 exons that are transcribed into mRNA and that the resulting mRNA species encoded a single cytosolic form of glyoxalase II. Here we show that this gene gives rise to two distinct mRNA species transcribed from 9 and 10 exons, respectively. The 9-exon-derived transcript encodes two protein species: mitochondrially targeted glyoxylase II, which is initiated from an AUG codon in a previously uncharacterized part of the mRNA sequence, and cytosolic glyoxalase II, which is initiated by internal ribosome entry at a downstream AUG codon. The transcript deriving from 10 exons has an in-frame termination codon between the two initiating AUG codons and hence only encodes the cytosolic form of the protein. Confocal fluorescence microscopy indicates that the mitochondrially targeted form of glyoxalase II is directed to the mitochondrial matrix. Analysis of glyoxalase II mRNA sequences from a number of species indicates that dual initiation from alternative AUG codons is conserved throughout vertebrates.	eng	28653	28661	The Journal of biological chemistry	279	27	2004	Jul	02	D017398;D000595;D000818;D001483;D015153;D002460;D003062;D003600/Q000201;D003600/Q000378;D018076/Q000378;D005091;D017930;D006801;D015151;D008156/Q000378;D018613;D008856;D008928/Q000201;D008928/Q000378;D008969;D016297;D009154;D010957/Q000378;D011401;D017433;D017434;D012333/Q000378;D011993/Q000378;D020133;D012270/Q000378;D013869/Q000737;D013869/Q000235	Alternative Splicing;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Base Sequence;Blotting, Western;Cell Line;Codon;Cytosol/enzymology;Cytosol/metabolism;DNA, Complementary/metabolism;Exons;Genes, Reporter;Humans;Immunoblotting;Luciferases/metabolism;Microscopy, Confocal;Microscopy, Fluorescence;Mitochondria/enzymology;Mitochondria/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Mutagenesis, Site-Directed;Mutation;Plasmids/metabolism;Promoter Regions, Genetic;Protein Structure, Secondary;Protein Structure, Tertiary;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Ribosomes/metabolism;Thiolester Hydrolases/chemistry;Thiolester Hydrolases/genetics	Cordell PA;Futers TS;Grant PJ;Pease RJ	Journal, Articles								False
1136	16198644	A preliminary account of the properties of recombinant human Glyoxylate reductase (GRHPR), LDHA and LDHB with glyoxylate, and their potential roles in its metabolism.	Human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is thought to contribute to the oxidation of glyoxylate to oxalate and thus to the pathogenesis of disorders of endogenous oxalate overproduction. Glyoxylate reductase (GRHPR) has a potentially protective role metabolising glyoxylate to the less reactive glycolate. In this paper, the kinetic parameters of recombinant human LDHA, LDHB and GR have been compared with respect to their affinity for glyoxylate and related substrates. The Km values and specificity constants (Kcat/K(M)) of purified recombinant human LDHA, LDHB and GRHPR were determined for the reduction of glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate. K(M) values with glyoxylate were 29.3 mM for LDHA, 9.9 mM for LDHB and 1.0 mM for GRHPR. For the oxidation of glyoxylate, K(M) values were 0.18 mM and 0.26 mM for LDHA and LDHB respectively with NAD+ as cofactor. Overall, under the same reaction conditions, the specificity constants suggest there is a fine balance between the reduction and oxidation reactions of these substrates, suggesting that control is most likely dictated by the ambient concentrations of the respective intracellular cofactors.

1137	15520449	Potential role of ABCA7 in cellular lipid efflux to apoA-I.	ABCA7 is homologous to ABCA1 and has recently been shown in cell culture to bind apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and to promote the efflux of phospholipids. However, it is not known if ABCA7 promotes lipid efflux in vivo. When expressed in HEK293 cells, both human and mouse ABCA7 promoted phospholipid efflux to apoA-I but no detectable cholesterol efflux. However, genetic knockdown of ABCA7 in mouse peritoneal macrophages did not affect phospholipid or cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. Moreover, in ABCA1-knockout macrophages, there was no detectable apoA-I-stimulated phospholipid efflux, inconsistent with a residual role of ABCA7. In contrast to plasma membrane localization of ABCA7 in transfected embryonic kidney cells, immunofluorescence microscopy of endogenous ABCA7 in macrophages showed a predominantly intracellular localization of the protein. Strikingly, immunofluorescence studies of adult mouse kidney revealed an apical brush border membrane localization of ABCA7 in the proximal tubule, suggesting that ABCA7 may come in contact with apoA-I in the glomerular filtrate. Although ABCA7 does not contribute to apolipoprotein-mediated lipid efflux in resting macrophages, its cell surface location in the kidney suggests that it could serve such a role in tissue microenvironments.	eng	86	92	Journal of lipid research	46	1	2005	Jan		D018528/Q000235;D018528/Q000378;D000818;D016632/Q000378;D001692;D005455;D007668/Q000737;D007668/Q000166;D050356;D017737/Q000378;D051379;D018345;D009399/Q000737;D010743/Q000378;D014018;D014162	ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism;Animals;Apolipoprotein A-I/metabolism;Biological Transport;Fluorescent Antibody Technique;Kidney/chemistry;Kidney/cytology;Lipid Metabolism;Macrophages, Peritoneal/metabolism;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Nephrons/chemistry;Phospholipids/metabolism;Tissue Distribution;Transfection	Linsel-Nitschke P;Jehle AW;Shan J;Cao G;Bacic D;Lan D;Wang N;Tall AR	Journal, Articles								False
1138	15963349	The 5'-nucleotidases as regulators of nucleotide and drug metabolism.	The 5'-nucleotidases are a family of enzymes that catalyze the dephosphorylation of nucleoside monophosphates and regulate cellular nucleotide and nucleoside levels. While the nucleoside kinases responsible for the initial phosphorylation of salvaged nucleosides have been well studied, many of the catabolic nucleotidases have only recently been cloned and characterized. Aside from maintaining balanced ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide pools, substrate cycles that are formed with kinase and nucleotidase activities are also likely to regulate the activation of nucleoside analogues, a class of anticancer and antiviral agents that rely on the nucleoside kinases for phosphorylation to their active forms. Both clinical and in vitro studies suggest that an increase in nucleotidase activity can inhibit nucleoside analogue activation and result in drug resistance. The physiological role of the 5'-nucleotidases will be covered in this review, as will the evidence that these enzymes can mediate resistance to nucleoside analogues.	eng	1	30	Pharmacology & therapeutics	107	1	2005	Jul		D015720/Q000502;D006801;D007700;D009708/Q000235;D009708/Q000378;D009708/Q000502;D009711/Q000378;D004364/Q000378	5'-Nucleotidase/physiology;Humans;Kinetics;Nucleotidases/genetics;Nucleotidases/metabolism;Nucleotidases/physiology;Nucleotides/metabolism;Pharmaceutical Preparations/metabolism	Hunsucker SA;Mitchell BS;Spychala J	Journal, Articles								False
1139	16135512	The mechanism of copper uptake mediated by human CTR1: a mutational analysis.	Cellular copper uptake is a prerequisite for the biosynthesis of many copper-dependent enzymes; disruption of copper uptake results in embryonic lethality. In humans, copper is transported into cells by hCTR1, a membrane protein, composed of 190 amino acids with only three trans-membrane segments. To provide insight into the mechanism of this unusual transporter, we characterized the functional properties of various hCTR1 mutants stably expressed in Sf9 cells. Most single amino acid substitutions involving charged and potential copper-coordinating residues have some influence on the V(max) and K(m) values for copper uptake but do not greatly alter hCTR1-mediated copper transport. However, there were two notable exceptions. Replacement of Tyr(156) with Ala greatly reduced the maximal transport rate without effect on the K(m) value for copper. Also, replacement of His(139) in the second trans-membrane segment with Arg caused a dramatic increase in the rate of copper uptake and a large increase in the K(m) value for copper. This effect was not seen with an Ala replacement, pointing to the role of a positive charge in modulating copper exit from the pathway. Truncated mutants demonstrated that the deletion of a large portion of the N-terminal domain only slightly decreased the apparent K(m) value for copper and decreased the rate of transport. Similar effects were observed with the removal of the last 11 C-terminal residues. The results suggested that the N and C termini, although nonessential for transport, may have an important role in facilitating the delivery of copper to and retrieving copper from, respectively, the translocation pathway. A model of how hCTR1 mediates copper entry into cells was proposed that included a rate-limiting site in the pore close to the intracellular exit.	eng	37159	37168	The Journal of biological chemistry	280	44	2005	Nov	04	D000595;D019943;D000818;D027682/Q000737;D027682/Q000235;D027682/Q000378;D003300/Q000378;D000079923;D004252;D006801;D007313;D017136;D008969;D011994;D017386	Amino Acid Sequence;Amino Acid Substitution;Animals;Cation Transport Proteins/chemistry;Cation Transport Proteins/genetics;Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism;Copper/metabolism;Copper Transporter 1;DNA Mutational Analysis;Humans;Insecta;Ion Transport;Molecular Sequence Data;Recombinant Proteins;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid	Eisses JF;Kaplan JH	Journal, Articles								False
1140	16081420	Omega-oxidation of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) in cerebral microvascular smooth muscle and endothelium by alcohol dehydrogenase 4.	20-Carboxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-COOH-AA) is a bioactive metabolite of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), an eicosanoid that produces vasoconstriction in the cerebral circulation. We found that smooth muscle (MSMC) and endothelial (MEC) cultures obtained from mouse brain microvessels convert [3H]20-HETE to 20-COOH-AA, indicating that the cerebral vasculature can produce this metabolite. The [3H]20-COOH-AA accumulated primarily in the culture medium, together with additional radiolabeled metabolites identified as the chain-shortened dicarboxylic acids 18-COOH-18:4, 18-COOH-18:3, and 16-COOH-16:3. N-Heptylformamide, a potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), decreased the conversion of [3H]20-HETE to 20-COOH-AA by the MSMC and MEC and also by isolated mouse brain microvessels. Purified mouse and human ADH4, human ADH3, and horse liver ADH1 efficiently oxidized 20-HETE, and ADH4 and ADH3 were detected in MSMC and MEC by Western blotting. N-Heptylformamide inhibited the oxidation of 20-HETE by mouse and human ADH4 but not by ADH3. These results demonstrated that cerebral microvessels convert 20-HETE to 20-COOH-AA and that ADH catalyzes the reaction. Although ADH4 and ADH3 are expressed in MSMC and MEC, the inhibition produced by N-heptylformamide suggests that ADH4 is primarily responsible for 20-COOH-AA formation in the cerebral microvasculature.	eng	33157	33164	The Journal of biological chemistry	280	39	2005	Sep	30	D000426/Q000235;D000426/Q000302;D000426/Q000378;D000818;D015153;D002384;D002470/Q000187;D002478;D003470/Q000032;D004791/Q000494;D005559/Q000494;D006893/Q000378;D007700;D008055/Q000032;D051379;D008833/Q000187;D008833/Q000201;D009131/Q000187;D009131/Q000201;D009131/Q000378;D010084;D011994/Q000302;D011994/Q000378;D013687/Q000098;D014316/Q000378	Alcohol Dehydrogenase/genetics;Alcohol Dehydrogenase/isolation & purification;Alcohol Dehydrogenase/metabolism;Animals;Blotting, Western;Catalysis;Cell Survival/drug effects;Cells, Cultured;Culture Media/analysis;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Formamides/pharmacology;Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/metabolism;Kinetics;Lipids/analysis;Mice;Microcirculation/drug effects;Microcirculation/enzymology;Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/drug effects;Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/enzymology;Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Telencephalon/blood supply;Tritium/metabolism	Collins XH;Harmon SD;Kaduce TL;Berst KB;Fang X;Moore SA;Raju TV;Falck JR;Weintraub NL;Duester G;Plapp BV;Spector AA	Journal, Articles								False
1141	26718047	13 Protein L-isoaspartyl, D-aspartyl O-methyltransferases: Catalysts for protein repair.	Protein L-isoaspartyl, D-aspartyl O-methyltransferases (PIMTs) are ancient enzymes distributed through all phylogenetic domains. PIMTs catalyze the methylation of L-isoaspartyl, and to a lesser extent D-aspartyl, residues arising from the spontaneous deamidation and isomerization of protein asparaginyl and aspartyl residues. PIMTs catalyze the methylation of isoaspartyl residues in a large number of primary sequence configurations, which accounts for the broad specificity of the enzyme for protein substrates both in vitro and in vivo. PIMT-catalyzed methylation of isoaspartyl substrates initiates the repair of the polypeptide backbone in its damaged substrates by a spontaneous mechanism that involves a succinimidyl intermediate. The repair process catalyzed by PEVITs is not completely efficient, however, leaving open the possibility that unidentified enzymatic activities cooperate with PIMT in the repair process. Structurally, PIMTs are members of the class I family of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. PIMTs have a unique topological arrangement of strands in the central β sheet that provides a signature for this class of enzymes. The regulation and physiological significance of PIMT has been studied in several model organisms. PIMTs are constitutively synthesized by cells, but they can be upregulated in response to conditions that are potentially damaging to protein structures, or when proteins are stored for prolonged periods of time. Disruption of PIMT genes in bacteria and simple eukaryotes produces subtle phenotypes that are apparent only under stress. Loss of PIMT function in transgenic mice leads to fatalepilepsy, suggesting that PIMT function is particularly important to neurons in mammals.	eng	385	433	The Enzymes	24		2006					O'Connor CM	Journal, Articles					10.1016/S1874-6047(06)80015-6			False
1142	16670083	Magnesium-dependent phosphatase-1 is a protein-fructosamine-6-phosphatase potentially involved in glycation repair.	Fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) is a recently described protein-repair enzyme responsible for the removal of fructosamines, which are the products of a spontaneous reaction of glucose with amines. We show here that, compared with glucose, glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P) reacted 3-6-fold more rapidly with proteins and 8-fold more rapidly with N-alpha-t-Boc-lysine, being therefore a more significant intracellular glycating agent than glucose in skeletal muscle and heart. Fructosamine 6-phosphates, which result from the reaction of amines with Glu-6-P, were not substrates for FN3K. However, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates protein-bound fructosamine 6-phosphates was found to be present in rat tissues. This enzyme was purified to near homogeneity from skeletal muscle and was identified as magnesium-dependent phosphatase-1 (MDP-1), an enzyme of the haloacid dehalogenase family with a putative protein-tyrosine phosphatase function. Human recombinant MDP-1 acted on protein-bound fructosamine 6-phosphates with a catalytic efficiency >10-fold higher than those observed with its next best substrates (arabinose 5-phosphate and free fructoselysine 6-phosphate) and >100-fold higher than with protein-phosphotyrosine. It had no detectable activity on fructosamine 3-phosphates. MDP-1 dephosphorylated up to approximately 75% of the fructosamine 6-phosphates that are present on lysozyme after incubation of this protein with Glu-6-P. Furthermore, lysozyme glycated with Glu-6-P was converted by MDP-1 to a substrate for FN3K. We conclude that MDP-1 may act physiologically in conjunction with FN3K to free proteins from the glycation products derived from Glu-6-P.	eng	18378	18385	The Journal of biological chemistry	281	27	2006	Jul	07	D000595;D000818;D019270/Q000378;D005947/Q000378;D019298/Q000378;D006801;D066298;D008969;D018482/Q000378;D009206/Q000378;D009928;D010749/Q000235;D010749/Q000378;D017853/Q000235;D017853/Q000378;D054645;D000071636;D051381;D011994/Q000235;D011994/Q000378;D013379	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Fructosamine/metabolism;Glucose/metabolism;Glucose-6-Phosphate/metabolism;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Molecular Sequence Data;Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism;Myocardium/metabolism;Organ Specificity;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/genetics;Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism;Protein Phosphatase 1;Protein Phosphatase 2C;Rats;Recombinant Proteins/genetics;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Fortpied J;Maliekal P;Vertommen D;Van Schaftingen E	Journal, Articles								False
1143	16965273	Dopaquinone redox exchange with dihydroxyindole and dihydroxyindole carboxylic acid.	A pulse radiolytic investigation has been conducted to establish whether a redox reaction takes place between dopaquinone and 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) and its 2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) and to measure the rate constants of the interactions. To obviate possible confounding reactions, such as nucleophilic addition, the method employed to generate dopaquinone used the dibromide radical anion acting on dopa to form the semiquinone which rapidly disproportionates to dopaquinone. In the presence of DHI the corresponding indole-5,6-quinone (and/or tautomers) was also formed directly but, by judicious selection of suitable relative concentrations of initial reactants, we were able to detect the formation of additional indolequinone from the redox exchange reaction of DHI with dopaquinone which exhibited a linear dependency on the concentration of DHI. Computer simulation of the experimental time profiles of the absorption changes showed that, under the conditions chosen, redox exchange does proceed but not quite to completion, a forward rate constant of 1.4 x 10(6)/M/s being obtained. This is in the same range as the rate constants previously established for reactions of dopaquinone with cyclodopa and cysteinyldopa. In similar experiments carried out with DHICA, the reaction more obviously does not go to completion and is much slower, k (forward) =1.6 x 10(5)/M/s. We conclude that, in the eumelanogenic pathway, DHI oxidation may take place by redox exchange with dopaquinone, although such a reaction is likely to be less efficient for DHICA.	eng	443	450	Pigment cell research	19	5	2006	Oct		D003198;D005609/Q000737;D007211/Q000737;D007700;D008956;D010084	Computer Simulation;Free Radicals/chemistry;Indoles/chemistry;Kinetics;Models, Chemical;Oxidation-Reduction	Edge R;d'Ischia M;Land EJ;Napolitano A;Navaratnam S;Panzella L;Pezzella A;Ramsden CA;Riley PA	Journal, Articles								False
1144	17402747	Initial-rate kinetics of human NMN-adenylyltransferases: substrate and metal ion specificity, inhibition by products and multisubstrate analogues, and isozyme contributions to NAD+ biosynthesis.	Initial-rate and product inhibition studies revealed distinctive ordered ternary complex kinetic mechanisms, substrate specificities, and metal ion preferences for the three isozymes of human nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl-transferase (NMNAT, EC 2.7.7.1). ATP binds before NMN with nuclear isozyme NMNAT1 and Golgi apparatus NMNAT2, but the opposite order is observed with the mitochondrial isozyme NMNAT3. Only the latter utilizes ITP efficiently in place of ATP, and while NMNH conversion to NADH by NMNAT1 and NMNAT3 occurs at similar rates, conversion by NMNAT2 is much slower. These isozymes can also be discriminated by their action on tiazofurin monophosphate (TrMP), a metabolite of the antineoplastic prodrug tiazofurin. Our finding that TrMP is only a substrate with NMNAT1 and NMNAT3 reveals for the first time an organelle selectivity in the metabolism of this important drug. In search of additional ways to discriminate these isozymes, we synthesized and tested the P1-(nicotinamide/nicotinate-riboside-5')-Pn-(adenosine-5') dinucleotides Np3AD, Np4AD, and Nap4AD. In addition to being highly effective inhibitors, these multisubstrate geometric inhibitors gave inhibition patterns that are consistent with the aforementioned isozyme differences in substrate binding order. Distinctive differences in their substrate specificity and metal ion selectivity also permitted us to quantify individual isozyme contributions to NAD+ formation in human cell extracts.	eng	4912	4922	Biochemistry	46	16	2007	Apr	24	D002460;D045744;D002712/Q000494;D006801;D007527/Q000378;D007700;D015636/Q000494;D009243/Q000096;D009536/Q000031;D009536/Q000737;D009612/Q000037;D009612/Q000378;D011726;D012254/Q000031;D012254/Q000378;D013379;D017967/Q000494	Cell Line;Cell Line, Tumor;Chlorides/pharmacology;Humans;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Kinetics;Magnesium Chloride/pharmacology;NAD/biosynthesis;Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives;Niacinamide/chemistry;Nicotinamide-Nucleotide Adenylyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors;Nicotinamide-Nucleotide Adenylyltransferase/metabolism;Pyridinium Compounds;Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives;Ribavirin/metabolism;Substrate Specificity;Zinc Compounds/pharmacology	Sorci L;Cimadamore F;Scotti S;Petrelli R;Cappellacci L;Franchetti P;Orsomando G;Magni G	Journal, Articles								False
1145	17661442	Human ABCB6 localizes to both the outer mitochondrial membrane and the plasma membrane.	Expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB6 has been associated with multiple cellular functions, including resistance to several cytotoxic agents, iron homeostasis, and porphyrin transport. To further elucidate its physiological function and/or role in drug resistance, we determined the subcellular location of ABCB6. Using three novel ABCB6-specific antibodies, Western blot analysis of cells expressing cDNA-derived or endogenous ABCB6 revealed two distinct molecular weight forms. Confocal microscopy indicates that the protein localizes to both mitochondria and the plasma membrane. Differential centrifugation revealed that the lower molecular weight form predominantly resides in the mitochondria, while the larger protein form is more abundant in the plasma membrane. Preliminary studies indicate that ABCB6 is functionally relevant in the plasma membrane, where its expression prevents the accumulation of specific porphyrins in the cell. Digitonin solubilization of mitochondria demonstrated that ABCB6 is present in the outer mitochondrial membrane, while back-titration assays with the ABCB6-specific antibodies reveal that the nucleotide binding domain of ABCB6 is cytoplasmic. These studies are the first to demonstrate that ABCB6 exists in two molecular weight forms, is localized to both the outer mitochondrial membrane and the plasma membrane, and plays a functional role in the plasma membrane.	eng	9443	9452	Biochemistry	46	33	2007	Aug	21	D018528/Q000032;D018528/Q000378;D045744;D002462/Q000737;D002462/Q000378;D006031;D006801;D051336/Q000737;D051336/Q000378;D011485	ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism;Cell Line, Tumor;Cell Membrane/chemistry;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Glycosylation;Humans;Mitochondrial Membranes/chemistry;Mitochondrial Membranes/metabolism;Protein Binding	Paterson JK;Shukla S;Black CM;Tachiwada T;Garfield S;Wincovitch S;Ernst DN;Agadir A;Li X;Ambudkar SV;Szakacs G;Akiyama S;Gottesman MM	Journal, Articles								False
1146	17145775	Multidrug transporter ABCG2/breast cancer resistance protein secretes riboflavin (vitamin B2) into milk.	The multidrug transporter breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) is strongly induced in the mammary gland during pregnancy and lactation. We here demonstrate that BCRP is responsible for pumping riboflavin (vitamin B(2)) into milk, thus supplying the young with this important nutrient. In Bcrp1(-/-) mice, milk secretion of riboflavin was reduced >60-fold compared to that in wild-type mice. Yet, under laboratory conditions, Bcrp1(-/-) pups showed no riboflavin deficiency due to concomitant milk secretion of its cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide, which was not affected. Thus, two independent secretion mechanisms supply vitamin B(2) equivalents to milk. BCRP is the first active riboflavin efflux transporter identified in mammals and the first transporter shown to concentrate a vitamin into milk. BCRP activity elsewhere in the body protects against xenotoxins by reducing their absorption and mediating their excretion. Indeed, Bcrp1 activity increased excretion of riboflavin into the intestine and decreased its systemic availability in adult mice. Surprisingly, the paradoxical dual utilization of BCRP as a xenotoxin and a riboflavin pump is evolutionarily conserved among mammals as diverse as mice and humans. This study establishes the principle that an ABC transporter can transport a vitamin into milk and raises the possibility that other vitamins and nutrients are likewise secreted into milk by ABC transporters.	eng	1247	1253	Molecular and cellular biology	27	4	2007	Feb		D000070997;D018528/Q000378;D000818;D001692;D001710/Q000032;D004285;D005260;D005486/Q000032;D005486/Q000097;D005182/Q000032;D005182/Q000097;D007774;D008297;D008321/Q000378;D051379;D008892/Q000737;D008892/Q000378;D009363/Q000378;D012256/Q000032;D012256/Q000737;D012256/Q000378;D012256/Q000493;D012727;D014018;D014316	ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism;Animals;Biological Transport;Biotin/analysis;Dogs;Female;Flavin Mononucleotide/analysis;Flavin Mononucleotide/blood;Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide/analysis;Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide/blood;Lactation;Male;Mammary Glands, Animal/metabolism;Mice;Milk/chemistry;Milk/metabolism;Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism;Riboflavin/analysis;Riboflavin/chemistry;Riboflavin/metabolism;Riboflavin/pharmacokinetics;Sex Characteristics;Tissue Distribution;Tritium	van Herwaarden AE;Wagenaar E;Merino G;Jonker JW;Rosing H;Beijnen JH;Schinkel AH	Journal, Articles								False
1147	17068342	Spatial expression patterns and biochemical properties distinguish a second myo-inositol monophosphatase IMPA2 from IMPA1.	Lithium is used in the clinical treatment of bipolar disorder, a disease where patients suffer mood swings between mania and depression. Although the mode of action of lithium remains elusive, a putative primary target is thought to be inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) activity. Two IMPase genes have been identified in mammals, the well characterized myo-inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1) and myo-inositol monophosphatase 2 (IMPA2). Several lines of genetic evidence have implicated IMPA2 in the pathogenesis of not only bipolar disorder but also schizophrenia and febrile seizures. However, little is known about the protein, although it is predicted to have lithium-inhibitable IMPase activity based on its homology to IMPA1. Here we present the first biochemical study comparing the enzyme activity of IMPA2 to that of IMPA1. We demonstrate that in vivo, IMPA2 forms homodimers but no heterodimers with IMPA1. Recombinant IMPA2 exhibits IMPase activity, although maximal activity requires higher concentrations of magnesium and a higher pH. IMPA2 shows significantly lower activity toward myo-inositol monophosphate than IMPA1. We therefore screened for additional substrates that could be more efficiently dephosphorylated by IMPA2, but failed to find any. Importantly, when using myo-inositol monophosphate as a substrate, the IMPase activity of IMPA2 was inhibited at high lithium and restricted magnesium concentrations. This kinetics distinguishes it from IMPA1. We also observed a characteristic pattern of differential expression between IMPA1 and IMPA2 in a selection of tissues including the brain, small intestine, and kidney. These data suggest that IMPA2 has a separate function in vivo from that of IMPA1.	eng	637	646	The Journal of biological chemistry	282	1	2007	Jan	05	D000595;D000818;D001921/Q000378;D005822;D006801;D006863;D051379;D008954;D008969;D010744/Q000096;D010744/Q000737;D010766;D011994/Q000737;D014018	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Brain/metabolism;Genetic Vectors;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Mice;Models, Biological;Molecular Sequence Data;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/biosynthesis;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/chemistry;Phosphorylation;Recombinant Proteins/chemistry;Tissue Distribution	Ohnishi T;Ohba H;Seo KC;Im J;Sato Y;Iwayama Y;Furuichi T;Chung SK;Yoshikawa T	Journal, Articles								False
1148	18000046	A human Na+/H+ antiporter sharing evolutionary origins with bacterial NhaA may be a candidate gene for essential hypertension.	Phylogenetic analysis of the cation/proton antiporter superfamily has uncovered a previously unknown clade of genes in metazoan genomes, including two previously uncharacterized human isoforms, NHA1 and NHA2, found in tandem on human chromosome 4. The NHA (sodium hydrogen antiporter) family members share significant sequence similarity with Escherichia coli NhaA, including a conserved double aspartate motif in predicted transmembrane 5. We show that HsNHA2 (Homo sapiens NHA2) resides on the plasma membrane and, in polarized MDCK cells, localizes to the apical domain. Analysis of mouse tissues indicates that NHA2 is ubiquitous. When expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking endogenous cation/proton antiporters and pumps, HsNHA2 can confer tolerance to Li(+) and Na(+) ions but not to K(+). HsNHA2 transformants accumulated less Li(+) than the salt-sensitive host; however, mutagenic replacement of the conserved aspartates abolished all observed phenotypes. Functional complementation by HsNHA2 was insensitive to amiloride, a characteristic inhibitor of plasma membrane sodium hydrogen exchanger isoforms, but was inhibited by phloretin. These are hallmarks of sodium-lithium countertransport activity, a highly heritable trait correlating with hypertension. Our findings raise the possibility that NHA genes may contribute to sodium-lithium countertransport activity and salt homeostasis in humans.	eng	18677	18681	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	104	47	2007	Nov	20	D000595;D000818;D017124;D004926/Q000235;D004926/Q000378;D029968/Q000235;D029968/Q000378;D019143;D005786;D006801;D006973/Q000235;D006973/Q000378;D008969;D010641;D012441/Q000235;D012441/Q000378;D016415;D017923/Q000737;D017923/Q000145;D017923/Q000235;D017923/Q000378	Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Conserved Sequence;Escherichia coli/genetics;Escherichia coli/metabolism;Escherichia coli Proteins/genetics;Escherichia coli Proteins/metabolism;Evolution, Molecular;Gene Expression Regulation;Humans;Hypertension/genetics;Hypertension/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Phenotype;Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics;Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism;Sequence Alignment;Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/chemistry;Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/classification;Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/genetics;Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/metabolism	Xiang M;Feng M;Muend S;Rao R	Journal, Articles								False
1149	18285344	Identification of a novel noninflammatory biosynthetic pathway of platelet-activating factor.	Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent lipid mediator playing various inflammatory and physiological roles. PAF is biosynthesized through two independent pathways called the de novo and remodeling pathways. Lyso-PAF acetyltransferase (lyso-PAF AT) was believed to biosynthesize PAF under inflammatory conditions, through the remodeling pathway. The first isolated lyso-PAF AT (LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2) had consistent properties. However, we show in this study the finding of a second lyso-PAF AT working under noninflammatory conditions. We partially purified a Ca(2+)-independent lyso-PAF AT from mouse lung. Immunoreactivity for lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) was detected in the active fraction. Lpcat1-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells exhibited both LPCAT and lyso-PAF AT activities. We confirmed that LPCAT1 transfers acetate from acetyl-CoA to lyso-PAF by the identification of an acetyl-CoA (and other acyl-CoAs) interacting site in LPCAT1. We further showed that LPCAT1 activity and expression are independent of inflammatory signals. Therefore, these results suggest the molecular diversity of lyso-PAF ATs is as follows: one (LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2) is inducible and activated by inflammatory stimulation, and the other (LPCAT1) is constitutively expressed. Each lyso-PAF AT biosynthesizes inflammatory and physiological amounts of PAF, depending on the cell type. These findings provide important knowledge for the understanding of the diverse pathological and physiological roles of PAF.	eng	11097	11106	The Journal of biological chemistry	283	17	2008	Apr	25	D008243/Q000378;D000818;D002118/Q000378;D007249;D008168/Q000378;D008264/Q000166;D051379;D008810;D008861/Q000378;D008954;D010972/Q000378;D011650/Q000166;D051381;D017207;D014162	1-Acylglycerophosphocholine O-Acyltransferase/metabolism;Animals;Calcium/metabolism;Inflammation;Lung/metabolism;Macrophages/cytology;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Microsomes/metabolism;Models, Biological;Platelet Activating Factor/metabolism;Pulmonary Alveoli/cytology;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Transfection	Harayama T;Shindou H;Ogasawara R;Suwabe A;Shimizu T	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M708909200			False
1150	18579530	Quinone reductase 2 is a catechol quinone reductase.	The functions of quinone reductase 2 have eluded researchers for decades even though a genetic polymorphism is associated with various neurological disorders. Employing enzymatic studies using adrenochrome as a substrate, we show that quinone reductase 2 is specific for the reduction of adrenochrome, whereas quinone reductase 1 shows no activity. We also solved the crystal structure of quinone reductase 2 in complexes with dopamine and adrenochrome, two compounds that are structurally related to catecholamine quinones. Detailed structural analyses delineate the mechanism of quinone reductase 2 specificity toward catechol quinones in comparison with quinone reductase 1; a side-chain rotational difference between quinone reductase 1 and quinone reductase 2 of a single residue, phenylalanine 106, determines the specificity of enzymatic activities. These results infer functional differences between two homologous enzymes and indicate that quinone reductase 2 could play important roles in the regulation of catecholamine oxidation processes that may be involved in the etiology of Parkinson disease.	eng	23829	23835	The Journal of biological chemistry	283	35	2008	Aug	29	D000323/Q000737;D000818;D002395/Q000737;D002395/Q000235;D002395/Q000378;D004298/Q000737;D004298/Q000235;D006801;D016660/Q000737;D016660/Q000235;D016660/Q000378;D010300/Q000201;D010300/Q000378;D011110;D051381	Adrenochrome/chemistry;Animals;Catecholamines/chemistry;Catecholamines/genetics;Catecholamines/metabolism;Dopamine/chemistry;Dopamine/genetics;Humans;NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/chemistry;NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/genetics;NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/metabolism;Parkinson Disease/enzymology;Parkinson Disease/metabolism;Polymorphism, Genetic;Rats	Fu Y;Buryanovskyy L;Zhang Z	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M801371200			False
1151	18826943	Human carbonyl reductase 1 is an S-nitrosoglutathione reductase.	Human carbonyl reductase 1 (hCBR1) is an NADPH-dependent short chain dehydrogenase/reductase with broad substrate specificity and is thought to be responsible for the in vivo reduction of quinones, prostaglandins, and other carbonyl-containing compounds including xenobiotics. In addition, hCBR1 possesses a glutathione binding site that allows for increased affinity toward GSH-conjugated molecules. It has been suggested that the GSH-binding site is near the active site; however, no structures with GSH or GSH conjugates have been reported. We have solved the x-ray crystal structures of hCBR1 and a substrate mimic in complex with GSH and the catalytically inert GSH conjugate hydroxymethylglutathione (HMGSH). The structures reveal the GSH-binding site and provide insight into the affinity determinants for GSH-conjugated substrates. We further demonstrate that the structural isostere of HMGSH, S-nitrosoglutathione, is an ideal hCBR1 substrate (Km = 30 microm, kcat = 450 min(-1)) with kinetic constants comparable with the best known hCBR1 substrates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hCBR1 dependent GSNO reduction occurs in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell lysates and suggest that hCBR1 may be involved in regulation of tissue levels of GSNO.	eng	35756	35762	The Journal of biological chemistry	283	51	2008	Dec	19	D000429/Q000737;D000429/Q000235;D000429/Q000378;D000445/Q000737;D000445/Q000235;D000445/Q000378;D020134/Q000502;D045744;D018360;D005978/Q000737;D005978/Q000235;D005978/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D010084;D017434/Q000502;D013379/Q000502	Alcohol Oxidoreductases/chemistry;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/genetics;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/chemistry;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/genetics;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Catalytic Domain/physiology;Cell Line, Tumor;Crystallography, X-Ray;Glutathione/chemistry;Glutathione/genetics;Glutathione/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Oxidation-Reduction;Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology;Substrate Specificity/physiology	Bateman RL;Rauh D;Tavshanjian B;Shokat KM	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M807125200			False
1152	18498772	Dcytb (Cybrd1) functions as both a ferric and a cupric reductase in vitro.	MDCK cells expressing an inducible duodenal cytochrome b-green fluorescent protein (Dcytb-EGFP) fusion construct were used to investigate the function of Dcytb. The Dcytb-EGFP protein was targeted correctly to the plasma membrane, and cells displayed increased ferric and cupric reductase activities, which were greatly reduced in the presence of doxycycline. The data suggests that Dcytb plays a physiological role in both iron and copper uptake, through divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and copper transporter 1, respectively. In support of this hypothesis, we show that 59Fe uptake was significantly enhanced in Dcytb-EGFP expressing MDCK cells which endogenously express DMT1.	eng	1901	1906	FEBS letters	582	13	2008	Jun	11	D000818;D027682/Q000378;D002460;D003300/Q000378;D000079923;D003573/Q000235;D003573/Q000378;D004285;D038181/Q000235;D038181/Q000378;D049452/Q000235;D017136;D007501/Q000378;D051379;D010088/Q000235;D010088/Q000378;D011993/Q000235;D011993/Q000378;D013379;D014162	Animals;Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism;Cell Line;Copper/metabolism;Copper Transporter 1;Cytochrome b Group/genetics;Cytochrome b Group/metabolism;Dogs;FMN Reductase/genetics;FMN Reductase/metabolism;Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics;Ion Transport;Iron/metabolism;Mice;Oxidoreductases/genetics;Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics;Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism;Substrate Specificity;Transfection	Wyman S;Simpson RJ;McKie AT;Sharp PA	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.febslet.2008.05.010			False
1153	19296407	Molecular cloning and oxidative modification of human lens ALDH1A1: implication in impaired detoxification of lipid aldehydes.	Earlier studies showed that human lens ALDH1A1 plays a critical role in protection against oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in human lens epithelial cells (HLEC), and opacification of rat and mouse lens. The complete coding sequence of ALDH1A1 was cloned from human lens cDNA library by using PCR methods and expressed it in Escherichia coli. The cloned human lens ALDH1A1 cDNA encodes a 501-amino-acid protein (molecular mass = 54.8 kD) that is 100% identical to human liver ALDH1A1 and shares significant identity with the same isozyme from other tissues and species. The purified recombinant human lens ALDH1A1 exhibited optimal catalytic activity at pH 8 and preferred NAD(+) as cofactor and specifically catalyzed the oxidation of toxic lipid aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE; K(m) = 4.8 microM) and malonaldehyde (K(m) MDA = 3.5 microM). Citral, disulfiram, and cyanamide were found to inhibit human lens ALDH1A1 at IC50 values of 55, 101, and 22610 microM, respectively, whereas diethylstilbestrol (DES) was found to be an activator (EC(50), 1.3 microM). Further, modification of recombinant human lens ALDH1A1 with nitric oxide donors such as S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) significantly inhibited the enzyme activity. It therefore appears that activation of ALDH1A1, which efficiently catalyzes the detoxification of lipid-derived toxic aldehydes, and/or prevention of its oxidative modification may be novel therapeutic interventions against oxidative stress-induced lens pathologies.	eng	577	584	Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

1154	19001417	Nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside salvage in fungi and mammals. Quantitative basis for Urh1 and purine nucleoside phosphorylase function in NAD+ metabolism.	NAD+ is a co-enzyme for hydride transfer enzymes and an essential substrate of ADP-ribose transfer enzymes and sirtuins, the type III protein lysine deacetylases related to yeast Sir2. Supplementation of yeast cells with nicotinamide riboside extends replicative lifespan and increases Sir2-dependent gene silencing by virtue of increasing net NAD+ synthesis. Nicotinamide riboside elevates NAD+ levels via the nicotinamide riboside kinase pathway and by a pathway initiated by splitting the nucleoside into a nicotinamide base followed by nicotinamide salvage. Genetic evidence has established that uridine hydrolase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase are required for Nrk-independent utilization of nicotinamide riboside in yeast. Here we show that mammalian purine nucleoside phosphorylase but not methylthioadenosine phosphorylase is responsible for mammalian nicotinamide riboside kinase-independent nicotinamide riboside utilization. We demonstrate that so-called uridine hydrolase is 100-fold more active as a nicotinamide riboside hydrolase than as a uridine hydrolase and that uridine hydrolase and mammalian purine nucleoside phosphorylase cleave nicotinic acid riboside, whereas the yeast phosphorylase has little activity on nicotinic acid riboside. Finally, we show that yeast nicotinic acid riboside utilization largely depends on uridine hydrolase and nicotinamide riboside kinase and that nicotinic acid riboside bioavailability is increased by ester modification.	eng	158	164	The Journal of biological chemistry	284	1	2009	Jan	02	D006655/Q000235;D006655/Q000378;D006801;D009243/Q000235;D009243/Q000378;D009536/Q000235;D009536/Q000378;D017853/Q000235;D017853/Q000378;D011683/Q000235;D011683/Q000378;D012441/Q000235;D012441/Q000378;D038281/Q000235;D038281/Q000378;D056565;D037761/Q000235;D037761/Q000378	Histone Deacetylases/genetics;Histone Deacetylases/metabolism;Humans;NAD/genetics;NAD/metabolism;Niacinamide/genetics;Niacinamide/metabolism;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism;Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/genetics;Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/metabolism;Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics;Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism;Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics;Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism;Sirtuin 2;Sirtuins/genetics;Sirtuins/metabolism	Belenky P;Christensen KC;Gazzaniga F;Pletnev AA;Brenner C	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M807976200			False
1155	18996184	Evidence for NQO2-mediated reduction of the carcinogenic estrogen ortho-quinones.	The physiological function of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1, DT-diaphorase) is to detoxify potentially reactive quinones by direct transfer of two electrons. A similar detoxification role has not been established for its homologue NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2). Estrogen quinones, including estradiol(E(2))-3,4-Q, generated by estrogen metabolism, are thought to be responsible for estrogen-initiated carcinogenesis. In this investigation, we have shown for the first time that NQO2 catalyzes the reduction of electrophilic estrogen quinones and thereby may act as a detoxification enzyme. ESI and MALDI mass spectrometric binding studies involving E(2)-3,4-Q with NQO2 clearly support the formation of an enzyme-substrate physical complex. The problem of spontaneous reduction of substrate by cofactor, benzyldihydronicotinamide riboside (BNAH), was successfully overcome by taking advantage of the ping-pong mechanism of NQO2 catalysis. The involvement of the enzyme in the reduction of E(2)-3,4-Q was further supported by addition of the inhibitor quercetin to the assay mixture. NQO2 is a newly discovered binding site (MT3) of melatonin. However, addition of melatonin to the assay mixture did not affect the catalytic activity of NQO2. Preliminary kinetic studies show that NQO2 is faster in reducing estrogen quinones than its homologue NQO1. Both UV and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assays unequivocally corroborate the reduction of estrogen ortho-quinones by NQO2, indicating that it could be a novel target for prevention of breast cancer initiation.	eng	253	262	Free radical biology & medicine	46	2	2009	Jan	15	D000042/Q000187;D002471;D004958/Q000031;D004958/Q000737;D004958/Q000378;D004967/Q000378;D006801;D008550/Q000494;D008956;D016660/Q000378;D010084/Q000187;D011485/Q000187;D011794/Q000494;D011808/Q000378;D011809/Q000378;D021241;D013379	Absorption/drug effects;Cell Transformation, Neoplastic;Estradiol/analogs & derivatives;Estradiol/chemistry;Estradiol/metabolism;Estrogens/metabolism;Humans;Melatonin/pharmacology;Models, Chemical;NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects;Protein Binding/drug effects;Quercetin/pharmacology;Quinone Reductases/metabolism;Quinones/metabolism;Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization;Substrate Specificity	Gaikwad NW;Yang L;Rogan EG;Cavalieri EL	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.10.029			False
1156	19374959	Generation of hydrogen peroxide in the melanin biosynthesis pathway.	The generation of H(2)O(2) in the melanin biosynthesis pathway is of great importance because of its great cytotoxic capacity. However, there is controversy concerning the way in which H(2)O(2) is generated in this pathway. In this work we demonstrate that it is generated in a series of chemical reactions coupled to the enzymatic formation of o-quinones by tyrosinase acting on monophenols and o-diphenols and during the auto-oxidation of the o-diphenols and other intermediates in the pathway. The use of the enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase helps reveal the H(2)O(2) generated. Based on the results obtained, we propose a scheme of enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions that lead to the biosynthesis of melanins, which explains the formation of H(2)O(2).	eng	1017	1029	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1794	7	2009	Jul		D002374/Q000378;D006861/Q000378;D008543/Q000096;D014442/Q000378;D010084;D010544/Q000378;D010636/Q000378;D013053/Q000379;D013482/Q000378	Catalase/metabolism;Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism;Melanins/biosynthesis;Monophenol Monooxygenase/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Peroxidases/metabolism;Phenols/metabolism;Spectrophotometry/methods;Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism	Munoz-Munoz JL;García-Molina F;Varón R;Tudela J;García-Cánovas F;Rodríguez-López JN	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bbapap.2009.04.002			False
1157	19273840	Relative CO2/NH3 selectivities of AQP1, AQP4, AQP5, AmtB, and RhAG.	The water channel aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and certain Rh-family members are permeable to CO(2) and NH(3). Here, we use changes in surface pH (pH(S)) to assess relative CO(2) vs. NH(3) permeability of Xenopus oocytes expressing members of the AQP or Rh family. Exposed to CO(2) or NH(3), AQP1 oocytes exhibit a greater maximal magnitude of pH(S) change (DeltapH(S)) compared with day-matched controls injected with H(2)O or with RNA encoding SGLT1, NKCC2, or PepT1. With CO(2), AQP1 oocytes also have faster time constants for pH(S) relaxation (tau(pHs)). Thus, AQP1, but not the other proteins, conduct CO(2) and NH(3). Oocytes expressing rat AQP4, rat AQP5, human RhAG, or the bacterial Rh homolog AmtB also exhibit greater DeltapH(S)(CO(2)) and faster tau(pHs) compared with controls. Oocytes expressing AmtB and RhAG, but not AQP4 or AQP5, exhibit greater DeltapH(S)(NH(3)) values. Only AQPs exhibited significant osmotic water permeability (P(f)). We computed channel-dependent (*) DeltapH(S) or P(f) by subtracting values for H(2)O oocytes from those of channel-expressing oocytes. For the ratio DeltapH(S)(CO(2))*/P(f)*, the sequence was AQP5 > AQP1 congruent with AQP4. For DeltapH(S)(CO(2))*/DeltapH(S)(NH(3))*, the sequence was AQP4 congruent with AQP5 > AQP1 > AmtB > RhAG. Thus, each channel exhibits a characteristic ratio for indices of CO(2) vs. NH(3) permeability, demonstrating that, like ion channels, gas channels can exhibit selectivity.	eng	5406	5411	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	106	13	2009	Mar	31	D000641/Q000378;D000818;D051398;D051401;D051402;D020346/Q000378;D001798/Q000378;D002245/Q000378;D027682/Q000378;D002463;D029968/Q000378;D006801;D006863;D008562/Q000378;D009865;D030781;D051381;D014162;D014981	Ammonia/metabolism;Animals;Aquaporin 1;Aquaporin 4;Aquaporin 5;Aquaporins/metabolism;Blood Proteins/metabolism;Carbon Dioxide/metabolism;Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism;Cell Membrane Permeability;Escherichia coli Proteins/metabolism;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism;Oocytes;Organisms, Genetically Modified;Rats;Transfection;Xenopus	Musa-Aziz R;Chen LM;Pelletier MF;Boron WF	Journal, Articles					10.1073/pnas.0813231106			False
1158	20110355	Estradiol induces export of sphingosine 1-phosphate from breast cancer cells via ABCC1 and ABCG2.	Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a potent sphingolipid mediator produced by sphingosine kinase isoenzymes (SphK1 and SphK2), regulates diverse cellular processes important for breast cancer progression acting in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. Here we show that SphK1, but not SphK2, increased S1P export from MCF-7 cells. Whereas for both estradiol (E(2)) and epidermal growth factor-activated SphK1 and production of S1P, only E(2) stimulated rapid release of S1P and dihydro-S1P from MCF-7 cells. E(2)-induced S1P and dihydro-S1P export required estrogen receptor-alpha, not GPR30, and was suppressed either by pharmacological inhibitors or gene silencing of ABCC1 (multidrug resistant protein 1) or ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein). Inhibiting these transporters also blocked E(2)-induced activation of ERK1/2, indicating that E(2) activates ERK via downstream signaling of S1P. Taken together, our findings suggest that E(2)-induced export of S1P mediated by ABCC1 and ABCG2 transporters and consequent activation of S1P receptors may contribute to nongenomic signaling of E(2) important for breast cancer pathophysiology.	eng	10477	10486	The Journal of biological chemistry	285	14	2010	Apr	02	D000070997;D018528/Q000235;D018528/Q000378;D015153;D001943/Q000235;D001943/Q000378;D045744;D004815/Q000494;D066246/Q000235;D066246/Q000378;D004958/Q000494;D004967/Q000494;D006801;D008246/Q000378;D019950/Q000235;D019950/Q000378;D048052/Q000235;D048052/Q000378;D027425/Q000235;D027425/Q000378;D009363/Q000235;D009363/Q000378;D017853/Q000235;D017853/Q000378;D012333/Q000235;D012333/Q000378;D020133;D021241;D013110/Q000031;D013110/Q000378	ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism;Blotting, Western;Breast Neoplasms/genetics;Breast Neoplasms/metabolism;Cell Line, Tumor;Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology;ErbB Receptors/genetics;ErbB Receptors/metabolism;Estradiol/pharmacology;Estrogens/pharmacology;Humans;Lysophospholipids/metabolism;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism;Neoplasm Proteins/genetics;Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism;RNA, Messenger/genetics;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization;Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives;Sphingosine/metabolism	Takabe K;Kim RH;Allegood JC;Mitra P;Ramachandran S;Nagahashi M;Harikumar KB;Hait NC;Milstien S;Spiegel S	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M109.064162			False

1160	19941951	Hydrogen peroxide is the major oxidant product of xanthine oxidase.	Xanthine oxidase (XO) is a critical source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in inflammatory disease. Focus, however, has centered almost exclusively on XO-derived superoxide (O(2)(*-)), whereas direct H(2)O(2) production from XO has been less well investigated. Therefore, we examined the relative quantities of O(2)(*-) and H(2)O(2) produced by XO under a range (1-21%) of O(2) tensions. At O(2) concentrations between 10 and 21%, H(2)O(2) accounted for approximately 75% of ROS production. As O(2) concentrations were lowered, there was a concentration-dependent increase in H(2)O(2) formation, accounting for 90% of ROS production at 1% O(2). Alterations in pH between 5.5 and 7.4 did not affect the relative proportions of H(2)O(2) and O(2)(*-) formation. Immobilization of XO, by binding to heparin-Sepharose, further enhanced relative H(2)O(2) production by approximately 30%, under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, XO bound to glycosaminoglycans on the apical surface of bovine aortic endothelial cells demonstrated a similar ROS production profile. These data establish H(2)O(2) as the dominant (70-95%) reactive product produced by XO under clinically relevant conditions and emphasize the importance of H(2)O(2) as a critical factor when examining the contributory roles of XO-catalyzed ROS in inflammatory processes as well as cellular signaling.	eng	493	498	Free radical biology & medicine	48	4	2010	Feb	15	D000818;D002021;D002417;D002470;D002478;D042783/Q000201;D006861/Q000737;D006861/Q000494;D006863;D008954;D016877/Q000737;D010100/Q000737;D010101;D015398;D014969/Q000737;D014969/Q000378	Animals;Buffers;Cattle;Cell Survival;Cells, Cultured;Endothelial Cells/enzymology;Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry;Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Models, Biological;Oxidants/chemistry;Oxygen/chemistry;Oxygen Consumption;Signal Transduction;Xanthine Oxidase/chemistry;Xanthine Oxidase/metabolism	Kelley EE;Khoo NK;Hundley NJ;Malik UZ;Freeman BA;Tarpey MM	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.11.012			False
1161	20569931	Ctr1 transports silver into mammalian cells.	Silver is a non-essential, toxic metal. The use of silver as an antimicrobial agent in many applications and its presence as a contaminant in foods and air can lead to accumulation in tissues. Despite its widespread use, the systems involved in the uptake of silver into mammalian cells are presently unknown. Previous studies have shown that copper uptake at the plasma membrane by copper transporter 1 (Ctr1) is inhibited by an excess of silver, suggesting that Ctr1 may function in importing silver into cells. In this study we examined directly the role of Ctr1 in the accumulation of silver in mammalian cells using over-expression experiments and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells lacking Ctr1. COS-7 cells transfected to express a human Ctr1-green fluorescent protein (hCtr1-GFP) fusion protein hyper-accumulated silver when incubated in medium supplemented with low micromolar concentrations (2.5-10 micromol/L) of AgNO(3). An hCtr1-GFPM150L,M154L variant deficient for copper transport failed to stimulate accumulation of silver. Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells lacking Ctr1 showed approximately a 50% reduction in silver content when incubated in silver-supplemented medium compared to a wild-type isogenic cell line. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Ctr1 transports both copper and silver and suggest that Ctr1 is an important transport protein in the accumulation of silver in mammalian cells.	eng	178	184	Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS)	24	3	2010	Jul		D000818;D001692/Q000187;D019556;D027682/Q000172;D027682/Q000378;D002522;D003300/Q000378;D000079923;D004622/Q000166;D005347/Q000166;D005347/Q000187;D005347/Q000378;D049452/Q000378;D006367;D006801;D051379;D011993/Q000378;D012834/Q000378;D012834/Q000494	Animals;Biological Transport/drug effects;COS Cells;Cation Transport Proteins/deficiency;Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism;Chlorocebus aethiops;Copper/metabolism;Copper Transporter 1;Embryo, Mammalian/cytology;Fibroblasts/cytology;Fibroblasts/drug effects;Fibroblasts/metabolism;Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism;HeLa Cells;Humans;Mice;Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism;Silver/metabolism;Silver/pharmacology	Bertinato J;Cheung L;Hoque R;Plouffe LJ	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.jtemb.2010.01.009			False
1162	20857498	Human pyruvate kinase M2: a multifunctional protein.	Glycolysis, a central metabolic pathway, harbors evolutionary conserved enzymes that modulate and potentially shift the cellular metabolism on requirement. Pyruvate kinase, which catalyzes the last but rate-limiting step of glycolysis, is expressed in four isozymic forms, depending on the tissue requirement. M2 isoform (PKM2) is exclusively expressed in embryonic and adult dividing/tumor cells. This tetrameric allosterically regulated isoform is intrinsically designed to downregulate its activity by subunit dissociation (into dimer), which results in partial inhibition of glycolysis at the last step. This accumulates all upstream glycolytic intermediates as an anabolic feed for synthesis of lipids and nucleic acids, whereas reassociation of PKM2 into active tetramer replenishes the normal catabolism as a feedback after cell division. In addition, involvement of this enzyme in a variety of pathways, protein-protein interactions, and nuclear transport suggests its potential to perform multiple nonglycolytic functions with diverse implications, although multidimensional role of this protein is as yet not fully explored. This review aims to provide an overview of the involvement of PKM2 in various physiological pathways with possible functional implications.	eng	2031	2044	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society	19	11	2010	Nov		D000595;D001483;D006801;D008958;D058977;D008969;D011770/Q000502	Amino Acid Sequence;Base Sequence;Humans;Models, Molecular;Molecular Sequence Annotation;Molecular Sequence Data;Pyruvate Kinase/physiology	Gupta V;Bamezai RN	Journal, Articles					10.1002/pro.505			False
1163	20170402	The redox activity of hemoglobins: from physiologic functions to pathologic mechanisms.	Pentacoordinate respiratory hemoproteins such as hemoglobin and myoglobin have evolved to supply cells with oxygen. However, these respiratory heme proteins are also known to function as redox enzymes, reacting with compounds such as nitric oxide and peroxides. The recent discoveries of hexacoordinate hemoglobins in vertebrates and nonsymbiotic plants suggest that the redox activity of globins is inherent to the molecule. The uncontrolled formation of radical species resulting from such redox chemistry on respiratory hemoproteins can lead to oxidative damage and cellular toxicity. In this review, we examine the functions of various globins and the mechanisms by which these globins act as redox enzymes under physiologic conditions. Evidence that redox reactions also occur under disease conditions, leading to pathologic complications, also is examined, focusing on recent discoveries showing that the ferryl oxidation state of these hemoproteins is present in these disease states in vivo. In addition, we review the latest advances in the understanding of globin redox mechanisms and how they might affect cellular signaling pathways and how they might be controlled therapeutically or, in the case of hemoglobin-based blood substitutes, through rational design.	eng	1087	1123	Antioxidants & redox signaling	13	7	2010	Oct	01	D000818;D001802/Q000737;D000078842;D005914/Q000737;D005914/Q000378;D006418/Q000737;D006418/Q000378;D006420/Q000378;D006454/Q000737;D006454/Q000378;D006454/Q000502;D006801;D009211/Q000737;D009211/Q000378;D009419/Q000378;D000078787;D009569/Q000737;D009569/Q000378;D010084;D010100/Q000378;D010545/Q000378;D015398	Animals;Blood Substitutes/chemistry;Cytoglobin;Globins/chemistry;Globins/metabolism;Heme/chemistry;Heme/metabolism;Hemeproteins/metabolism;Hemoglobins/chemistry;Hemoglobins/metabolism;Hemoglobins/physiology;Humans;Myoglobin/chemistry;Myoglobin/metabolism;Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism;Neuroglobin;Nitric Oxide/chemistry;Nitric Oxide/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxygen/metabolism;Peroxides/metabolism;Signal Transduction	Reeder BJ	Journal, Articles					10.1089/ars.2009.2974			False
1164	20705604	ABCG2 transports and transfers heme to albumin through its large extracellular loop.	ABCG2 is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter preferentially expressed by immature human hematopoietic progenitors. Due to its role in drug resistance, its expression has been correlated with a protection role against protoporhyrin IX (PPIX) accumulation in stem cells under hypoxic conditions. We show here that zinc mesoporphyrin, a validated fluorescent heme analog, is transported by ABCG2. We also show that the ABCG2 large extracellular loop ECL3 constitutes a porphyrin-binding domain, which strongly interacts with heme, hemin, PPIX, ZnPPIX, CoPPIX, and much less efficiently with pheophorbide a, but not with vitamin B12. K(d) values are in the range 0.5-3.5 μm, with heme displaying the highest affinity. Nonporphyrin substrates of ABCG2, such as mitoxantrone, doxo/daunorubicin, and riboflavin, do not bind to ECL3. Single-point mutations H583A and C603A inside ECL3 prevent the binding of hemin but hardly affect that of iron-free PPIX. The extracellular location of ECL3 downstream from the transport sites suggests that, after membrane translocation, hemin is transferred to ECL3, which is strategically positioned to release the bound porphyrin to extracellular partners. We show here that human serum albumin could be one of these possible partners as it removes hemin bound to ECL3 and interacts with ABCG2, with a K(d) of about 3 μm.	eng	33123	33133	The Journal of biological chemistry	285	43	2010	Oct	22	D000070997;D018528/Q000737;D018528/Q000235;D018528/Q000378;D000970/Q000737;D000970/Q000378;D000970/Q000494;D015687/Q000502;D002734/Q000031;D002734/Q000737;D002734/Q000378;D002734/Q000494;D006412/Q000378;D006418/Q000737;D006418/Q000235;D006418/Q000378;D006801;D020014;D008652/Q000737;D008652/Q000378;D008652/Q000494;D009363/Q000737;D009363/Q000235;D009363/Q000378;D017319/Q000737;D017319/Q000378;D017319/Q000494;D017354;D017433;D011524/Q000737;D011524/Q000235;D011524/Q000378;D011524/Q000494;D012709/Q000737;D012709/Q000235;D012709/Q000378;D014805/Q000737;D014805/Q000378;D014805/Q000494;D014803/Q000737;D014803/Q000378;D014803/Q000494	ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/chemistry;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism;Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry;Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism;Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology;Cell Hypoxia/physiology;Chlorophyll/analogs & derivatives;Chlorophyll/chemistry;Chlorophyll/metabolism;Chlorophyll/pharmacology;Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism;Heme/chemistry;Heme/genetics;Heme/metabolism;Humans;K562 Cells;Mesoporphyrins/chemistry;Mesoporphyrins/metabolism;Mesoporphyrins/pharmacology;Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry;Neoplasm Proteins/genetics;Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism;Photosensitizing Agents/chemistry;Photosensitizing Agents/metabolism;Photosensitizing Agents/pharmacology;Point Mutation;Protein Structure, Secondary;Protoporphyrins/chemistry;Protoporphyrins/genetics;Protoporphyrins/metabolism;Protoporphyrins/pharmacology;Serum Albumin/chemistry;Serum Albumin/genetics;Serum Albumin/metabolism;Vitamin B 12/chemistry;Vitamin B 12/metabolism;Vitamin B 12/pharmacology;Vitamin B Complex/chemistry;Vitamin B Complex/metabolism;Vitamin B Complex/pharmacology	Desuzinges-Mandon E;Arnaud O;Martinez L;Huché F;Di Pietro A;Falson P	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M110.139170			False
1165	20493944	Thermodynamic and kinetic considerations for the reaction of semiquinone radicals to form superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.	"The quinone/semiquinone/hydroquinone triad (Q/SQ(*-)/H(2)Q) represents a class of compounds that has great importance in a wide range of biological processes. The half-cell reduction potentials of these redox couples in aqueous solutions at neutral pH, E degrees ', provide a window to understanding the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of this triad and their associated chemistry and biochemistry in vivo. Substituents on the quinone ring can significantly influence the electron density ""on the ring"" and thus modify E degrees' dramatically. E degrees' of the quinone governs the reaction of semiquinone with dioxygen to form superoxide. At near-neutral pH the pK(a)'s of the hydroquinone are outstanding indicators of the electron density in the aromatic ring of the members of these triads (electrophilicity) and thus are excellent tools to predict half-cell reduction potentials for both the one-electron and two-electron couples, which in turn allow estimates of rate constants for the reactions of these triads. For example, the higher the pK(a)'s of H(2)Q, the lower the reduction potentials and the higher the rate constants for the reaction of SQ(*-) with dioxygen to form superoxide. However, hydroquinone autoxidation is controlled by the concentration of di-ionized hydroquinone; thus, the lower the pK(a)'s the less stable H(2)Q to autoxidation. Catalysts, e.g., metals and quinone, can accelerate oxidation processes; by removing superoxide and increasing the rate of formation of quinone, superoxide dismutase can accelerate oxidation of hydroquinones and thereby increase the flux of hydrogen peroxide. The principal reactions of quinones are with nucleophiles via Michael addition, for example, with thiols and amines. The rate constants for these addition reactions are also related to E degrees'. Thus, pK(a)'s of a hydroquinone and E degrees ' are central to the chemistry of these triads."	eng	919	962	Free radical biology & medicine	49	6	2010	Sep	15	D016227/Q000737;D001671;D006801;D006861/Q000737;D010084;D013481/Q000737;D013816	Benzoquinones/chemistry;Biochemistry;Humans;Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry;Oxidation-Reduction;Superoxides/chemistry;Thermodynamics	Song Y;Buettner GR	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2010.05.009			False
1166	21910479	Specificity of human aldo-keto reductases, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, and carbonyl reductases to redox-cycle polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon diones and 4-hydroxyequilenin-o-quinone.	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are suspect human lung carcinogens and can be metabolically activated to remote quinones, for example, benzo[a]pyrene-1,6-dione (B[a]P-1,6-dione) and B[a]P-3,6-dione by the action of either P450 monooxygenase or peroxidases, and to non-K region o-quinones, for example B[a]P-7,8-dione, by the action of aldo keto reductases (AKRs). B[a]P-7,8-dione also structurally resembles 4-hydroxyequilenin o-quinone. These three classes of quinones can redox cycle, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), and produce the mutagenic lesion 8-oxo-dGuo and may contribute to PAH- and estrogen-induced carcinogenesis. We compared the ability of a complete panel of human recombinant AKRs to catalyze the reduction of PAH o-quinones in the phenanthrene, chrysene, pyrene, and anthracene series. The specific activities for NADPH-dependent quinone reduction were often 100-1000 times greater than the ability of the same AKR isoform to oxidize the cognate PAH-trans-dihydrodiol. However, the AKR with the highest quinone reductase activity for a particular PAH o-quinone was not always identical to the AKR isoform with the highest dihydrodiol dehydrogenase activity for the respective PAH-trans-dihydrodiol. Discrete AKRs also catalyzed the reduction of B[a]P-1,6-dione, B[a]P-3,6-dione, and 4-hydroxyequilenin o-quinone. Concurrent measurements of oxygen consumption, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide formation established that ROS were produced as a result of the redox cycling. When compared with human recombinant NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) and carbonyl reductases (CBR1 and CBR3), NQO1 was a superior catalyst of these reactions followed by AKRs and last CBR1 and CBR3. In A549 cells, two-electron reduction of PAH o-quinones causes intracellular ROS formation. ROS formation was unaffected by the addition of dicumarol, suggesting that NQO1 is not responsible for the two-electron reduction observed and does not offer protection against ROS formation from PAH o-quinones.	eng	2153	2166	Chemical research in toxicology	24	12	2011	Dec	19	D000429/Q000235;D000429/Q000378;D000449;D000074408;D001580/Q000737;D001580/Q000633;D055162;D045744;D004855/Q000031;D004855/Q000737;D004855/Q000378;D004855/Q000633;D006801;D007536;D016660/Q000235;D016660/Q000378;D010084/Q000187;D011084/Q000737;D011084/Q000378;D011084/Q000633;D011809/Q000737;D011809/Q000378;D011809/Q000633;D017382/Q000378;D011994/Q000235;D011994/Q000378;D013379	Alcohol Oxidoreductases/genetics;Alcohol Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Aldehyde Reductase;Aldo-Keto Reductases;Benzopyrenes/chemistry;Benzopyrenes/toxicity;Biocatalysis;Cell Line, Tumor;Equilenin/analogs & derivatives;Equilenin/chemistry;Equilenin/metabolism;Equilenin/toxicity;Humans;Isomerism;NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/genetics;NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects;Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons/chemistry;Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons/metabolism;Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons/toxicity;Quinones/chemistry;Quinones/metabolism;Quinones/toxicity;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins/genetics;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Substrate Specificity	Shultz CA;Quinn AM;Park JH;Harvey RG;Bolton JL;Maser E;Penning TM	Journal, Articles					10.1021/tx200294c			False
1167	20956085	Membrane transport of sepiapterin and dihydrobiopterin by equilibrative nucleoside transporters: a plausible gateway for the salvage pathway of tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis.	Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) is synthesized de novo in particular cells, but in the case of a systemic or local BH(4) deficiency, BH(4) supplementation therapy is applied. BH(4)-responsive PKU has also been effectively treated with BH(4) supplementation. However, the rapid clearance of the supplemented BH(4) has prevented the therapy from being widely accepted. Deposition of BH(4) after supplementation involves oxidation of BH(4) to dihydrobiopterin (BH(2)) and subsequent conversion to BH(4) by the salvage pathway. This pathway is known to be almost ubiquitous in the body. However, the mechanism for the redistribution and exclusion of BH(4) across the plasma membrane remains unclear. The aim of this work was to search for the key transporter of the uptake precursor of the salvage pathway. Based on the observed sensitivity of pterin transport to nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), we examined the ability of ENT1 and ENT2, representative equilibrative nucleoside transporters, to transport sepiapterin (SP), BH(2) or BH(4) using HeLa cell and Xenopus oocyte expression systems. hENT2 was capable of transporting the pterins with an efficiency of SP>BH(2)>BH(4). hENT1 could also transport the pterins but less efficiently. Non-transfected HeLa cells and rat aortic endothelial cells were able to incorporate the pterins and accumulate BH(4) via uptake that is likely mediated by ENT2 (SP>BH(2)>BH(4)). When exogenous BH(2) was given to mice, it was efficiently converted to BH(4) and its tissue deposition was similar to that of sepiapterin as reported (Sawabe et al., 2004). BH(4) deposition after BH(2) administration was influenced by prior treatment with NBMPR, suggesting that the distribution of the administered BH(2) was largely mediated by ENT2, although urinary excretion appeared to be managed by other mechanisms. The molecular basis of the transport of SP, BH(2), and BH(4) across the plasma membrane has now been described for the first time: ENT2 is a transporter of these pterins and is a plausible gateway to the salvage pathway of BH(4) biosynthesis, at least under conditions of exogenous pterin supplementation. The significance of the gateway was discussed in terms of BH(2) uptake for BH(4) accumulation and the release for modifying the intracellular BH(2)/BH(4) ratio.	eng	18	28	Molecular genetics and metabolism	102	1	2011	Jan		D000818;D001708/Q000031;D001708/Q000378;D001708/Q000494;D042783/Q000378;D004730/Q000378;D033705/Q000037;D033705/Q000096;D033705/Q000378;D005260;D006367;D006801;D066298;D051379;D008810;D009865/Q000378;D011622/Q000378;D051381;D017207;D011994/Q000378;D013868/Q000031;D013868/Q000494;D014982	Animals;Biopterins/analogs & derivatives;Biopterins/metabolism;Biopterins/pharmacology;Endothelial Cells/metabolism;Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism;Equilibrative Nucleoside Transport Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors;Equilibrative Nucleoside Transport Proteins/biosynthesis;Equilibrative Nucleoside Transport Proteins/metabolism;Female;HeLa Cells;Humans;In Vitro Techniques;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Oocytes/metabolism;Pterins/metabolism;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism;Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives;Thioinosine/pharmacology;Xenopus laevis	Ohashi A;Sugawara Y;Mamada K;Harada Y;Sumi T;Anzai N;Aizawa S;Hasegawa H	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.ymgme.2010.09.005			False
1168	21446918	OAT2 catalyses efflux of glutamate and uptake of orotic acid.	OAT (organic anion transporter) 2 [human gene symbol SLC22A7 (SLC is solute carrier)] is a member of the SLC22 family of transport proteins. In the rat, the principal site of expression of OAT2 is the sinusoidal membrane domain of hepatocytes. The particular physiological function of OAT2 in liver has been unresolved so far. In the present paper, we have used the strategy of LC (liquid chromatography)-MS difference shading to search for specific and cross-species substrates of OAT2. Heterologous expression of human and rat OAT2 in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells stimulated accumulation of the zwitterion trigonelline; subsequently, orotic acid was identified as an excellent and specific substrate of OAT2 from the rat (clearance=106 μl·min⁻¹·mg of protein⁻¹) and human (46 μl·min⁻¹·mg of protein⁻¹). The force driving uptake of orotic acid was identified as glutamate antiport. Efficient transport of glutamate by OAT2 was directly demonstrated by uptake of [³H]glutamate. However, because of high intracellular glutamate, OAT2 operates as glutamate efflux transporter. Thus expression of OAT2 markedly increased the release of glutamate (measured by LC-MS) from cells, even without extracellular exchange substrate. Orotic acid strongly trans-stimulated efflux of glutamate. We thus propose that OAT2 physiologically functions as glutamate efflux transporter. OAT2 mRNA was detected, after laser capture microdissection of rat liver slices, equally in periportal and pericentral regions; previous reports of hepatic release of glutamate into blood can now be explained by OAT2 activity. A specific OAT2 inhibitor could, by lowering plasma glutamate and thus promoting brain-to-blood efflux of glutamate, alleviate glutamate exotoxicity in acute brain conditions.	eng	305	312	The Biochemical journal	436	2	2011	Jun	01	D000470/Q000378;D000818;D001693/Q000235;D020134/Q000235;D002461;D018698/Q000378;D057809;D006801;D029362/Q000235;D029362/Q000378;D009963/Q000378;D051381;D013379/Q000235	Alkaloids/metabolism;Animals;Biological Transport, Active/genetics;Catalytic Domain/genetics;Cell Line, Transformed;Glutamic Acid/metabolism;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent/genetics;Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent/metabolism;Orotic Acid/metabolism;Rats;Substrate Specificity/genetics	Fork C;Bauer T;Golz S;Geerts A;Weiland J;Del Turco D;Schömig E;Gründemann D	Journal, Articles					10.1042/BJ20101904			False
1169	21732914	Thioredoxin and dihydrolipoic acid are required for 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase to produce hydrogen sulfide.	H2S (hydrogen sulfide) has recently been recognized as a signalling molecule as well as a cytoprotectant. We recently demonstrated that 3MST (3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase) produces H2S from 3MP (3-mercaptopyruvate). Although a reducing substance is required for an intermediate persulfide at the active site of 3MST to release H2S, the substance has not been identified. In the present study we show that Trx (thioredoxin) and DHLA (dihydrolipoic acid) associate with 3MST to release H2S. Other reducing substances, such as NADPH, NADH, GSH, cysteine and CoA, did not have any effect on the reaction. We also show that 3MST produces H2S from thiosulfate. The present study provides a new insight into a mechanism for the production of H2S by 3MST.	eng	479	485	The Biochemical journal	439	3	2011	Nov	01	D000818;D001921/Q000201;D001921/Q000378;D045744;D057809;D006801;D006862/Q000378;D051379;D008810;D008928/Q000201;D008928/Q000378;D013466/Q000737;D013466/Q000378;D008063/Q000031;D008063/Q000737;D008063/Q000378;D013879/Q000737;D013879/Q000378	Animals;Brain/enzymology;Brain/metabolism;Cell Line, Tumor;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Hydrogen Sulfide/metabolism;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mitochondria/enzymology;Mitochondria/metabolism;Sulfurtransferases/chemistry;Sulfurtransferases/metabolism;Thioctic Acid/analogs & derivatives;Thioctic Acid/chemistry;Thioctic Acid/metabolism;Thioredoxins/chemistry;Thioredoxins/metabolism	Mikami Y;Shibuya N;Kimura Y;Nagahara N;Ogasawara Y;Kimura H	Journal, Articles					10.1042/BJ20110841			False
1170	22554803	Augmentation of reduced folate carrier-mediated folate/antifolate transport through an antiport mechanism with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside monophosphate.	5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), an agent with diverse pharmacological properties, augments transport of folates and antifolates. This report further characterizes this phenomenon and defines the mechanism by which it occurs. Exposure of HeLa cells to AICAR resulted in augmentation of methotrexate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate initial rates and net uptake in cells that express the reduced folate carrier (RFC). This did not occur in cells that express only the proton-coupled folate transporter and accumulated folates by this mechanism. Transport stimulation correlated with the accumulation of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribotide monophosphate (ZMP), the monophosphate derivative of AICAR, within cells as established by liquid chromatography. When ZMP formation was blocked with 5-iodotubercidin, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase, folate transport stimulation by AICAR was absent. When cells first accumulated ZMP and were then exposed to 5-iodotubercidin or AICAR-free buffer, the ZMP level markedly decreased and folate transport stimulation was abolished. Extracellular ZMP inhibited RFC-mediated folate influx, and the presence of intracellular ZMP correlated with inhibition of folate efflux. The data indicate that intracellular ZMP trans-stimulates folate influx and inhibits folate efflux, which, together, produce a marked augmentation in the net cellular folate level. This interaction among ZMP, folates, and RFC, a folate/organic phosphate antiporter, is consistent with a classic exchange reaction. The transmembrane gradient for one transport substrate (ZMP) drives the uphill transport of another (folate) via a carrier used by both substrates, a phenomenon intrinsic to the energetics of RFC-mediated folate transport.	eng	209	216	Molecular pharmacology	82	2	2012	Aug		D000620/Q000031;D000620/Q000378;D000620/Q000494;D004357;D005493/Q000819;D005493/Q000378;D006367;D006801;D021381/Q000187;D021381/Q000502;D058978/Q000819;D058978/Q000378;D012265/Q000378;D012265/Q000494	Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/metabolism;Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/pharmacology;Drug Synergism;Folic Acid Antagonists/agonists;Folic Acid Antagonists/metabolism;HeLa Cells;Humans;Protein Transport/drug effects;Protein Transport/physiology;Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/agonists;Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/metabolism;Ribonucleotides/metabolism;Ribonucleotides/pharmacology	Visentin M;Zhao R;Goldman ID	Journal, Articles					10.1124/mol.112.078642			False
1171	22162139	The monocarboxylate transporter family--role and regulation.	Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) isoforms 1-4 catalyze the proton-linked transport of monocarboxylates such as L-lactate across the plasma membrane, whereas MCT8 and MCT10 are thyroid hormone and aromatic amino acid transporters, respectively. The importance of MCTs is becoming increasingly evident as their extensive physiological and pathological roles are revealed. MCTs 1-4 play essential metabolic roles in most tissues with their distinct properties, expression profile, and subcellular localization matching the particular metabolic needs of a tissue. Important metabolic roles include energy metabolism in the brain, skeletal muscle, heart, tumor cells, and T-lymphocyte activation, gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney, spermatogenesis, bowel metabolism of short-chain fatty acids, and drug transport. MCT8 is essential for thyroid hormone transport across the blood-brain barrier. Genetic perturbation of MCT function may be involved in disease states such as pancreatic β-cell malfunction (inappropriate MCT1 expression), chronic fatigue syndromes (impairment of muscle MCT function), and psychomotor retardation (MCT8 mutation). MCT expression can be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Of particular importance is the upregulation of muscle MCT1 expression in response to training and MCT4 expression in response to hypoxia. The latter is mediated by hypoxia inducible factor 1α and often observed in tumor cells that rely almost entirely on glycolysis for their energy provision. The recent discovery of potent and specific MCT1 inhibitors that prevent proliferation of T-lymphocytes confirms that MCTs may be promising pharmacological targets including for cancer chemotherapy.	eng	109	119	IUBMB life	64	2	2012	Feb		D000818;D051926/Q000378;D051926/Q000502;D002264/Q000378;D005786;D006801;D027501/Q000235;D027501/Q000378;D027501/Q000502;D009154;D020033/Q000235;D020033/Q000378;D020033/Q000502;D014158	Animals;Basigin/metabolism;Basigin/physiology;Carboxylic Acids/metabolism;Gene Expression Regulation;Humans;Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters/genetics;Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters/metabolism;Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters/physiology;Mutation;Protein Isoforms/genetics;Protein Isoforms/metabolism;Protein Isoforms/physiology;Transcription, Genetic	Halestrap AP;Wilson MC	Journal, Articles					10.1002/iub.572			False
1172	22131303	The monocarboxylate transporter family--Structure and functional characterization.	Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) catalyze the proton-linked transport of monocarboxylates such as L-lactate, pyruvate, and the ketone bodies across the plasma membrane. There are four isoforms, MCTs 1-4, which are known to perform this function in mammals, each with distinct substrate and inhibitor affinities. They are part of the larger SLC16 family of solute carriers, also known as the MCT family, which has 14 members in total, all sharing conserved sequence motifs. The family includes a high-affinity thyroid hormone transporter (MCT8), an aromatic amino acid transporter (T-type amino acid transporter 1/MCT10), and eight orphan members yet to be characterized. MCTs were predicted to have 12 transmembrane helices (TMs) with intracellular C- and N-termini and a large intracellular loop between TMs 6 and 7, and this was confirmed by labeling studies and proteolytic digestion. Site-directed mutagenesis has identified key residues required for catalysis and inhibitor binding and enabled the development of a molecular model of MCT1 in both inward and outward facing conformations. This suggests a likely mechanism for the translocation cycle. Although MCT family members are not themselves glycosylated, MCTs1-4 require association with a glycosylated ancillary protein, either basigin or embigin, for their correct translocation to the plasma membrane. These ancillary proteins have a single transmembrane domain and two to three extracellular immunoglobulin domains. They must remain closely associated with MCTs1-4 to maintain transporter activity. MCT1, MCT3, and MCT4 bind preferentially to basigin and MCT2 to embigin. The choice of binding partner does not affect substrate specificity or kinetics but can influence inhibitor specificity.	eng	1	9	IUBMB life	64	1	2012	Jan		D000818;D002264/Q000737;D002264/Q000378;D002462/Q000378;D006801;D027501/Q000737;D027501/Q000378;D027501/Q000502;D011485;D017434;D013379	Animals;Carboxylic Acids/chemistry;Carboxylic Acids/metabolism;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters/chemistry;Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters/metabolism;Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters/physiology;Protein Binding;Protein Structure, Tertiary;Substrate Specificity	Halestrap AP	Journal, Articles					10.1002/iub.573			False
1173	24957512	5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-Monophosphate (AICAR), a Highly Conserved Purine Intermediate with Multiple Effects.	AICAR (5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl 5'-monophosphate) is a natural metabolic intermediate of purine biosynthesis that is present in all organisms. In yeast, AICAR plays important regulatory roles under physiological conditions, notably through its direct interactions with transcription factors. In humans, AICAR accumulates in several metabolic diseases, but its contribution to the symptoms has not yet been elucidated. Further, AICAR has highly promising properties which have been recently revealed. Indeed, it enhances endurance of sedentary mice. In addition, it has antiproliferative effects notably by specifically inducing apoptosis of aneuploid cells. Some of the effects of AICAR are due to its ability to stimulate the AMP-activated protein kinase but some others are not. It is consequently clear that AICAR affects multiple targets although only few of them have been identified so far. This review proposes an overview of the field and suggests future directions.	eng	292	302	Metabolites	2	2	2012	Mar	23			Daignan-Fornier B;Pinson B	Journal, Articles					10.3390/metabo2020292			False
1174	22878645	Significance of short chain fatty acid transport by members of the monocarboxylate transporter family (MCT).	Metabolism of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the brain, particularly that of acetate, appears to occur mainly in astrocytes. The differential use has been attributed to transport, but the extent to which transmembrane movement of SCFA is mediated by transporters has not been investigated systematically. Here we tested the possible contribution of monocarboxylate transporters to SCFA uptake by measuring fluxes with labelled compounds and by following changes of the intracellular pH in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the isoforms MCT1, MCT2 or MCT4. All isoforms mediated significant transport of acetate. Formate, however, was transported only by MCT1. The contribution of MCT1 to SCFA transport was determined by using phloretin as a high-affinity inhibitor, which allowed a paired comparison of oocytes with and without active MCT1.	eng	2562	2568	Neurochemical research	37	11	2012	Nov		D000818;D001692;D005227/Q000378;D005260;D006863;D027501/Q000378;D014982	Animals;Biological Transport;Fatty Acids/metabolism;Female;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters/metabolism;Xenopus laevis	Moschen I;Bröer A;Galić S;Lang F;Bröer S	Journal, Articles					10.1007/s11064-012-0857-3			False
1175	22898811	ZIP8 is an iron and zinc transporter whose cell-surface expression is up-regulated by cellular iron loading.	ZIP8 (SLC39A8) belongs to the ZIP family of metal-ion transporters. Among the ZIP proteins, ZIP8 is most closely related to ZIP14, which can transport iron, zinc, manganese, and cadmium. Here we investigated the iron transport ability of ZIP8, its subcellular localization, pH dependence, and regulation by iron. Transfection of HEK 293T cells with ZIP8 cDNA enhanced the uptake of (59)Fe and (65)Zn by 200 and 40%, respectively, compared with controls. Excess iron inhibited the uptake of zinc and vice versa. In RNA-injected Xenopus oocytes, ZIP8-mediated (55)Fe(2+) transport was saturable (K(0.5) of ∼0.7 μm) and inhibited by zinc. ZIP8 also mediated the uptake of (109)Cd(2+), (57)Co(2+), (65)Zn(2+) > (54)Mn(2+), but not (64)Cu (I or II). By using immunofluorescence analysis, we found that ZIP8 expressed in HEK 293T cells localized to the plasma membrane and partially in early endosomes. Iron loading increased total and cell-surface levels of ZIP8 in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells. We also determined by using site-directed mutagenesis that asparagine residues 40, 88, and 96 of rat ZIP8 are glycosylated and that N-glycosylation is not required for iron or zinc transport. Analysis of 20 different human tissues revealed abundant ZIP8 expression in lung and placenta and showed that its expression profile differs markedly from ZIP14, suggesting nonredundant functions. Suppression of endogenous ZIP8 expression in BeWo cells, a placental cell line, reduced iron uptake by ∼40%, suggesting that ZIP8 participates in placental iron transport. Collectively, these data identify ZIP8 as an iron transport protein that may function in iron metabolism.	eng	34032	34043	The Journal of biological chemistry	287	41	2012	Oct	05	D000818;D027682/Q000096;D027682/Q000235;D045744;D002462/Q000235;D002462/Q000378;D057809;D006801;D017136/Q000502;D007501/Q000378;D009865;D009928/Q000502;D051381;D015854/Q000502;D014982	Animals;Cation Transport Proteins/biosynthesis;Cation Transport Proteins/genetics;Cell Line, Tumor;Cell Membrane/genetics;Cell Membrane/metabolism;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Ion Transport/physiology;Iron/metabolism;Oocytes;Organ Specificity/physiology;Rats;Up-Regulation/physiology;Xenopus laevis	Wang CY;Jenkitkasemwong S;Duarte S;Sparkman BK;Shawki A;Mackenzie B;Knutson MD	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M112.367284			False
1176	22705145	Interaction of the cardiovascular risk marker asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) with the human cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1).	Elevated plasma concentrations of endogenously formed asymmetric (ADMA) and symmetric dimethyl-l-arginine (SDMA) are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Our aim was to investigate the cellular uptake properties of ADMA by the human cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1; SLC7A1). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) stably overexpressing CAT1 (HEK-CAT1) and vector-transfected control cells (HEK-VC) were established to determine cellular uptake of labeled [(3)H]ADMA and [(3)H]l-arginine. Uptake of ADMA and l-arginine were significantly (p<0.001) higher in HEK-CAT1 than in HEK-VC at all investigated concentrations. Apparent V(max) values of cellular ADMA and l-arginine uptake by CAT1 were 26.9 ± 0.8 and 11.0 ± 0.2 nmol mg protein(-1) min(-1), respectively. K(m) values were 183 ± 21 μmoll(-1) (ADMA) and 519 ± 36 μmoll(-1) (l-arginine). Uptake of ADMA was inhibited by l-arginine and SDMA with IC(50) values (95% CI) of 227 (69-742) μmoll(-1) and 273 (191-390) μmoll(-1), respectively. ADMA and SDMA inhibited CAT1-mediated uptake of l-arginine with IC(50) values of 758 (460-1251) μmoll(-1) and 789 (481-1295) μmoll(-1), respectively. Efflux of ADMA was significantly increased in HEK-CAT1 cells as compared to HEK-VC (p<0.05). CAT1 mediates the cellular uptake of ADMA. In its physiological concentration range ADMA is unlikely to impair CAT1-mediated transport of l-arginine. Conversely, high (but still physiological) concentrations of l-arginine can inhibit CAT1-mediated cellular uptake of ADMA.	eng	392	400	Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology	53	3	2012	Sep		D001120/Q000031;D001120/Q000378;D001692;D015415;D002318/Q000235;D002318/Q000378;D027201/Q000235;D027201/Q000378;D015870;D057809;D006801;D007697;D008687/Q000378;D012306	Arginine/analogs & derivatives;Arginine/metabolism;Biological Transport;Biomarkers;Cardiovascular Diseases/genetics;Cardiovascular Diseases/metabolism;Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1/genetics;Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1/metabolism;Gene Expression;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Kinesics;Metformin/metabolism;Risk	Strobel J;Mieth M;Endress B;Auge D;König J;Fromm MF;Maas R	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.06.002			False
1177	23021219	TMEM16F forms a Ca2+-activated cation channel required for lipid scrambling in platelets during blood coagulation.	Collapse of membrane lipid asymmetry is a hallmark of blood coagulation. TMEM16F of the TMEM16 family that includes TMEM16A/B Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels (CaCCs) is linked to Scott syndrome with deficient Ca(2+)-dependent lipid scrambling. We generated TMEM16F knockout mice that exhibit bleeding defects and protection in an arterial thrombosis model associated with platelet deficiency in Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatidylserine exposure and procoagulant activity and lack a Ca(2+)-activated cation current in the platelet precursor megakaryocytes. Heterologous expression of TMEM16F generates a small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated nonselective cation (SCAN) current with subpicosiemens single-channel conductance rather than a CaCC. TMEM16F-SCAN channels permeate both monovalent and divalent cations, including Ca(2+), and exhibit synergistic gating by Ca(2+) and voltage. We further pinpointed a residue in the putative pore region important for the cation versus anion selectivity of TMEM16F-SCAN and TMEM16A-CaCC channels. This study thus identifies a Ca(2+)-activated channel permeable to Ca(2+) and critical for Ca(2+)-dependent scramblase activity during blood coagulation.

1179	24260472	N (6)-substituted AMPs inhibit mammalian deoxynucleotide N-hydrolase DNPH1.	The gene dnph1 (or rcl) encodes a hydrolase that cleaves the 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate (dNMP) N-glycosidic bond to yield a free nucleobase and 2-deoxyribose 5-phosphate. Recently, the crystal structure of rat DNPH1, a potential target for anti-cancer therapies, suggested that various analogs of AMP may inhibit this enzyme. From this result, we asked whether N (6)-substituted AMPs, and among them, cytotoxic cytokinin riboside 5'-monophosphates, may inhibit DNPH1. Here, we characterized the structural and thermodynamic aspects of the interactions of these various analogs with DNPH1. Our results indicate that DNPH1 is inhibited by cytotoxic cytokinins at concentrations that inhibit cell growth.	eng	e80755		PloS one	8	11	2013			D000249/Q000031;D000249/Q000737;D000249/Q000378;D000249/Q000494;D000595;D000818;D020134;D004789/Q000187;D006801;D007700;D008958;D008968;D008969;D009699/Q000737;D009699/Q000235;D009699/Q000378;D009687/Q000737;D009687/Q000235;D009687/Q000378;D011485;D011518/Q000737;D011518/Q000235;D011518/Q000378;D051381;D016415;D013816	Adenosine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives;Adenosine Monophosphate/chemistry;Adenosine Monophosphate/metabolism;Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology;Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Catalytic Domain;Enzyme Activation/drug effects;Humans;Kinetics;Models, Molecular;Molecular Conformation;Molecular Sequence Data;N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/chemistry;N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/genetics;N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/metabolism;Nuclear Proteins/chemistry;Nuclear Proteins/genetics;Nuclear Proteins/metabolism;Protein Binding;Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry;Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics;Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism;Rats;Sequence Alignment;Thermodynamics	Amiable C;Pochet S;Padilla A;Labesse G;Kaminski PA	Journal, Articles								False
1180	23721920	Substrate specificity, plasma membrane localization, and lipid modification of the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3B1.	The accumulation of reactive aldehydes is implicated in the development of several disorders. Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) detoxify aldehydes by oxidizing them to the corresponding carboxylic acids. Among the 19 human ALDHs, ALDH3A2 is the only known ALDH that catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain fatty aldehydes including C16 aldehydes (hexadecanal and trans-2-hexadecenal) generated through sphingolipid metabolism. In the present study, we have identified that ALDH3B1 is also active in vitro toward C16 aldehydes and demonstrated that overexpression of ALDH3B1 restores the sphingolipid metabolism in the ALDH3A2-deficient cells. In addition, we have determined that ALDH3B1 is localized in the plasma membrane through its C-terminal dual lipidation (palmitoylation and prenylation) and shown that the prenylation is required particularly for the activity toward hexadecanal. Since knockdown of ALDH3B1 does not cause further impairment of the sphingolipid metabolism in the ALDH3A2-deficient cells, the likely physiological function of ALDH3B1 is to oxidize lipid-derived aldehydes generated in the plasma membrane and not to be involved in the sphingolipid metabolism in the endoplasmic reticulum.	eng	1395	1401	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1831	8	2013	Aug		D000445/Q000378;D000447/Q000378;D002462/Q000201;D002462/Q000235;D004721/Q000201;D004721/Q000235;D055785;D057809;D006367;D006801;D050356/Q000502;D054878/Q000502;D013107/Q000378;D013379/Q000502	Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Aldehydes/metabolism;Cell Membrane/enzymology;Cell Membrane/genetics;Endoplasmic Reticulum/enzymology;Endoplasmic Reticulum/genetics;Gene Knockdown Techniques;HEK293 Cells;HeLa Cells;Humans;Lipid Metabolism/physiology;Lipoylation/physiology;Sphingolipids/metabolism;Substrate Specificity/physiology	Kitamura T;Naganuma T;Abe K;Nakahara K;Ohno Y;Kihara A	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bbalip.2013.05.007			False
1181	23792964	Efficient purification and reconstitution of ATP binding cassette transporter B6 (ABCB6) for functional and structural studies.	The mitochondrial ATP binding cassette transporter ABCB6 has been associated with a broad range of physiological functions, including growth and development, therapy-related drug resistance, and the new blood group system Langereis. ABCB6 has been proposed to regulate heme synthesis by shuttling coproporphyrinogen III from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. However, direct functional information of the transport complex is not known. To understand the role of ABCB6 in mitochondrial transport, we developed an in vitro system with pure and active protein. ABCB6 overexpressed in HEK293 cells was solubilized from mitochondrial membranes and purified to homogeneity. Purified ABCB6 showed a high binding affinity for MgATP (Kd = 0.18 μM) and an ATPase activity with a Km of 0.99 mM. Reconstitution of ABCB6 into liposomes allowed biochemical characterization of the ATPase including (i) substrate-stimulated ATPase activity, (ii) transport kinetics of its proposed endogenous substrate coproporphyrinogen III, and (iii) transport kinetics of substrates identified using a high throughput screening assay. Mutagenesis of the conserved lysine to alanine (K629A) in the Walker A motif abolished ATP hydrolysis and substrate transport. These results suggest a direct interaction between mitochondrial ABCB6 and its transport substrates that is critical for the activity of the transporter. Furthermore, the simple immunoaffinity purification of ABCB6 to near homogeneity and efficient reconstitution of ABCB6 into liposomes might provide the basis for future studies on the structure/function of ABCB6.	eng	22658	22669	The Journal of biological chemistry	288	31	2013	Aug	02	D018528/Q000737;D018528/Q000302;D018528/Q000378;D000255/Q000378;D003306/Q000378;D057809;D006801;D007700;D008563/Q000378;D008928/Q000378;D011485;D011487;D020033/Q000737;D020033/Q000302;D020033/Q000378	ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/chemistry;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/isolation & purification;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Coproporphyrins/metabolism;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Kinetics;Membrane Lipids/metabolism;Mitochondria/metabolism;Protein Binding;Protein Conformation;Protein Isoforms/chemistry;Protein Isoforms/isolation & purification;Protein Isoforms/metabolism	Chavan H;Khan MM;Tegos G;Krishnamurthy P	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M113.485284			False
1182	23284076	The CFTR ion channel: gating, regulation, and anion permeation.	Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-gated anion channel with two remarkable distinctions. First, it is the only ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that is known to be an ion channel--almost all others function as transport ATPases. Second, CFTR is the only ligand-gated channel that consumes its ligand (ATP) during the gating cycle--a consequence of its enzymatic activity as an ABC transporter. We discuss these special properties of CFTR in the context of its evolutionary history as an ABC transporter. Other topics include the mechanisms by which CFTR gating is regulated by phosphorylation of its unique regulatory domain and our current view of the CFTR permeation pathway (or pore). Understanding these basic operating principles of the CFTR channel is central to defining the mechanisms of action of prospective cystic fibrosis drugs and to the development of new, rational treatment strategies.	eng	a009498		Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine	3	1	2013	Jan	01	D018528/Q000235;D000255/Q000378;D000838/Q000378;D003550/Q000188;D003550/Q000235;D003550/Q000378;D019005/Q000235;D006801;D015640/Q000235;D007473/Q000378;D058446/Q000235;D010766/Q000235	ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Anions/metabolism;Cystic Fibrosis/drug therapy;Cystic Fibrosis/genetics;Cystic Fibrosis/metabolism;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator/genetics;Humans;Ion Channel Gating/genetics;Ion Channels/metabolism;Ligand-Gated Ion Channels/genetics;Phosphorylation/genetics	Hwang TC;Kirk KL	Journal, Articles								False
1183	23416111	The human adenylate kinase 9 is a nucleoside mono- and diphosphate kinase.	Adenylate kinases regulate adenine nucleotide levels and are present in different intracellular compartments. These enzymes also participate in the activation of pharmacologically active nucleoside and nucleotide analogs. We have in the present study identified the ninth isoform of the adenylate kinase family of enzymes and accordingly named the protein adenylate kinase 9 (AK9). Initially a full-length cDNA of a hypothetical protein containing a predicted adenylate kinase domain was identified and subsequently cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The substrate specificity of the recombinant protein showed that the enzyme catalyzed the phosphorylation of AMP, dAMP, CMP and dCMP with ATP as phosphate donor, while only AMP and CMP were phosphorylated when GTP was the phosphate donor. The kinetic parameters of AK9 were determined for AMP, dAMP and CMP with ATP as phosphate donor. Interestingly, in addition to the diphosphate products, a nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity was also present with subsequent triphosphates formed. With ATP or GTP as phosphate donor it was possible to detect the production of ATP, CTP, GTP, UTP, dATP, dCTP, dGTP and TTP as enzymatic products from the corresponding diphosphate substrates. A number of previously characterized adenylate kinases were also tested and found to possess a broad phosphotransferase activity similar to AK9. These enzymes are accordingly suggested to be regarded as nucleoside mono- and diphosphate kinases with catalytic activities possibly determined by local substrate concentrations.	eng	925	931	The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology	45	5	2013	May		D000263/Q000737;D000263/Q000235;D000263/Q000378;D000595;D018929;D006367;D006801;D007700;D009701/Q000737;D009701/Q000235;D009701/Q000378;D009703/Q000737;D009703/Q000235;D009703/Q000378;D009711/Q000378;D010957;D013379;D014162	Adenylate Kinase/chemistry;Adenylate Kinase/genetics;Adenylate Kinase/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Cell Culture Techniques;HeLa Cells;Humans;Kinetics;Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/chemistry;Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/genetics;Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/metabolism;Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/chemistry;Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/genetics;Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/metabolism;Nucleotides/metabolism;Plasmids;Substrate Specificity;Transfection	Amiri M;Conserva F;Panayiotou C;Karlsson A;Solaroli N	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.biocel.2013.02.004			False
1184	24495878	The many isoforms of human adenylate kinases.	Adenine nucleotides are involved in a variety of cellular metabolic processes, including nucleic acid synthesis and repair, formation of coenzymes, energy transfer, cell and ciliary motility, hormone secretion, gene expression regulation and ion-channel control. Adenylate kinases are abundant phosphotransferases that catalyze the interconversion of adenine nucleotides and thus regulate the adenine nucleotide ratios in different intracellular compartments. Nine different adenylate kinase isoenzymes have been identified and characterized so far in human tissues, named AK1 to AK9 according to their order of discovery. Adenylate kinases differ in molecular weight, tissue distribution, subcellular localization, substrate and phosphate donor specificity and kinetic properties. The preferred substrate and phosphate donor of all adenylate kinases are AMP and ATP respectively, but some members of the family can phosphorylate other substrates and use other phosphate donors. In addition to their nucleoside monophosphate kinase activity, adenylate kinases were found to possess nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity as they are able to phosphorylate both ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates to their corresponding triphosphates. Nucleoside analogues are structural analogues of natural nucleosides, used in the treatment of cancer and viral infections. They are inactive prodrugs that are dependent on intracellular phosphorylation to their pharmacologically active triphosphate form. Novel data presented in this review confirm the role of adenylate kinases in the activation of deoxyadenosine and deoxycytidine nucleoside analogues.	eng	75	83	The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology	49		2014	Apr		D000249/Q000378;D000255/Q000378;D000263/Q000145;D000263/Q000235;D000263/Q000378;D000595;D006801;D007527/Q000145;D007527/Q000235;D007527/Q000378;D008969;D010802;D017386;D013379	Adenosine Monophosphate/metabolism;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Adenylate Kinase/classification;Adenylate Kinase/genetics;Adenylate Kinase/metabolism;Amino Acid Sequence;Humans;Isoenzymes/classification;Isoenzymes/genetics;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Molecular Sequence Data;Phylogeny;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Substrate Specificity	Panayiotou C;Solaroli N;Karlsson A	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.biocel.2014.01.014			False
1185	24569995	Bifunctional homodimeric triokinase/FMN cyclase: contribution of protein domains to the activities of the human enzyme and molecular dynamics simulation of domain movements.	Mammalian triokinase, which phosphorylates exogenous dihydroxyacetone and fructose-derived glyceraldehyde, is neither molecularly identified nor firmly associated to an encoding gene. Human FMN cyclase, which splits FAD and other ribonucleoside diphosphate-X compounds to ribonucleoside monophosphate and cyclic X-phosphodiester, is identical to a DAK-encoded dihydroxyacetone kinase. This bifunctional protein was identified as triokinase. It was modeled as a homodimer of two-domain (K and L) subunits. Active centers lie between K1 and L2 or K2 and L1: dihydroxyacetone binds K and ATP binds L in different subunits too distant (≈ 14 Å) for phosphoryl transfer. FAD docked to the ATP site with ribityl 4'-OH in a possible near-attack conformation for cyclase activity. Reciprocal inhibition between kinase and cyclase reactants confirmed substrate site locations. The differential roles of protein domains were supported by their individual expression: K was inactive, and L displayed cyclase but not kinase activity. The importance of domain mobility for the kinase activity of dimeric triokinase was highlighted by molecular dynamics simulations: ATP approached dihydroxyacetone at distances below 5 Å in near-attack conformation. Based upon structure, docking, and molecular dynamics simulations, relevant residues were mutated to alanine, and kcat and Km were assayed whenever kinase and/or cyclase activity was conserved. The results supported the roles of Thr(112) (hydrogen bonding of ATP adenine to K in the closed active center), His(221) (covalent anchoring of dihydroxyacetone to K), Asp(401) and Asp(403) (metal coordination to L), and Asp(556) (hydrogen bonding of ATP or FAD ribose to L domain). Interestingly, the His(221) point mutant acted specifically as a cyclase without kinase activity.	eng	10620	10636	The Journal of biological chemistry	289	15	2014	Apr	11	D000818;D002384;D020134;D019281;D005182/Q000737;D005632/Q000737;D005985/Q000737;D006801;D006863;D007700;D056004;D016297;D009154;D019761/Q000737;D019761/Q000502;D010766;D017853/Q000737;D017434;D011994/Q000737;D013379;D013552	Animals;Catalysis;Catalytic Domain;Dimerization;Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide/chemistry;Fructose/chemistry;Glyceraldehyde/chemistry;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Kinetics;Molecular Dynamics Simulation;Mutagenesis, Site-Directed;Mutation;Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases/chemistry;Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases/physiology;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/chemistry;Protein Structure, Tertiary;Recombinant Proteins/chemistry;Substrate Specificity;Swine	Rodrigues JR;Couto A;Cabezas A;Pinto RM;Ribeiro JM;Canales J;Costas MJ;Cameselle JC	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M113.525626			False
1186	24815905	Cu(II)-catalyzed oxidation of dopamine in aqueous solutions: mechanism and kinetics.	Spontaneous oxidation of dopamine (DA) and the resultant formation of free radical species within dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) is thought to bestow a considerable oxidative load upon these neurons and may contribute to their vulnerability to degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). An understanding of DA oxidation under physiological conditions is thus critical to understanding the relatively selective vulnerability of these dopaminergic neurons in PD and may support the development of novel neuro-protective approaches for this disorder. In this study, the oxidation of dopamine (0.2-10μM) was investigated both in the absence and the presence of copper (0.01-0.4μM), a redox active metal that is present at considerable concentrations in the SN, over a range of background chloride concentrations (0.01-0.7M), different oxygen concentrations and at physiological pH7.4. DA was observed to oxidize extremely slowly in the absence of copper and at moderate rates only in the presence of copper but without chloride. The oxidation of DA however was significantly enhanced in the presence of both copper and chloride with the rate of DA oxidation greatest at intermediate chloride concentrations (0.05-0.2M). The variability of the catalytic effect of Cu(II) on DA oxidation at different chloride concentrations can be explained and successfully modeled by appropriate consideration of the reaction of Cu(II) species with DA and the conversion of Cu(I) to Cu(II) through oxygenation. This model suggests that the speciation of Cu(II) and Cu(I) is critically important to the kinetics of DA oxidation and thus the vulnerability to degradation of dopaminergic neuron in the brain milieu.	eng	74	84	Journal of inorganic biochemistry	137		2014	Aug		D002384;D003300/Q000737;D004298/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D009474/Q000737;D009474/Q000378;D010084;D018384;D010300/Q000378;D010300/Q000473;D014867/Q000737	Catalysis;Copper/chemistry;Dopamine/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Neurons/chemistry;Neurons/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Parkinson Disease/metabolism;Parkinson Disease/pathology;Water/chemistry	Pham AN;Waite TD	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2014.03.018			False
1187	25229427	DERA is the human deoxyribose phosphate aldolase and is involved in stress response.	Deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.4), which converts 2-deoxy-d-ribose-5-phosphate into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and acetaldehyde, belongs to the core metabolism of living organisms. It was previously shown that human cells harbor deoxyribose phosphate aldolase activity but the protein responsible of this activity has never been formally identified. This study provides the first experimental evidence that DERA, which is mainly expressed in lung, liver and colon, is the human deoxyribose phosphate aldolase. Among human cell lines, the highest DERA mRNA level and deoxyribose phosphate aldolase activity were observed in liver-derived Huh-7 cells. DERA was shown to interact with the known stress granule component YBX1 and to be recruited to stress granules after oxidative or mitochondrial stress. In addition, cells in which DERA expression was down-regulated using shRNA formed fewer stress granules and were more prone to apoptosis after clotrimazole stress, suggesting the importance of DERA for stress granule formation. Furthermore, the expression of DERA was shown to permit cells in which mitochondrial ATP production was abolished to make use of extracellular deoxyinosine to maintain ATP levels. This study unraveled a previously undescribed pathway which may allow cells with high deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase activity, such as liver cells, to minimize or delay stress-induced damage by producing energy through deoxynucleoside degradation.	eng	2913	2925	Biochimica et biophysica acta	1843	12	2014	Dec				Salleron L;Magistrelli G;Mary C;Fischer N;Bairoch A;Lane L	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bbamcr.2014.09.007			False
1188	25375833	Distinct properties of the two isoforms of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase.	CDP-diacylglycerol synthases (CDS) are critical enzymes that catalyze the formation of CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) from phosphatidic acid (PA). Here we show in vitro that the two isoforms of human CDS, CDS1 and CDS2, show different acyl chain specificities for its lipid substrate. CDS2 is selective for the acyl chains at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, the most preferred species being 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-phosphatidic acid. CDS1, conversely, shows no particular substrate specificity, displaying similar activities for almost all substrates tested. Additionally, we show that inhibition of CDS2 by phosphatidylinositol is also acyl chain-dependent, with the strongest inhibition seen with the 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species. CDS1 shows no acyl chain-dependent inhibition. Both CDS1 and CDS2 are inhibited by their anionic phospholipid end products, with phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate showing the strongest inhibition. Our results indicate that CDS1 and CDS2 could create different CDP-DAG pools that may serve to enrich different phospholipid species with specific acyl chains.	eng	7358	7367	Biochemistry	53	47	2014	Dec	02	D000818;D019556;D002522;D003567/Q000378;D002798/Q000037;D002798/Q000378;D004791/Q000494;D006801;D007527/Q000037;D007527/Q000378;D010712/Q000737;D010712/Q000378;D010716/Q000494;D021381;D013379	Animals;COS Cells;Chlorocebus aethiops;Cytidine Diphosphate Diglycerides/metabolism;Diacylglycerol Cholinephosphotransferase/antagonists & inhibitors;Diacylglycerol Cholinephosphotransferase/metabolism;Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology;Humans;Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors;Isoenzymes/metabolism;Phosphatidic Acids/chemistry;Phosphatidic Acids/metabolism;Phosphatidylinositols/pharmacology;Protein Transport;Substrate Specificity	D'Souza K;Kim YJ;Balla T;Epand RM	Journal, Articles					10.1021/bi501250m			False
1189	24332717	Structure, functional characterization, and evolution of the dihydroorotase domain of human CAD.	Upregulation of CAD, the multifunctional protein that initiates and controls the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines in animals, is essential for cell proliferation. Deciphering the architecture and functioning of CAD is of interest for its potential usage as an antitumoral target. However, there is no detailed structural information about CAD other than that it self-assembles into hexamers of ∼1.5 MDa. Here we report the crystal structure and functional characterization of the dihydroorotase domain of human CAD. Contradicting all assumptions, the structure reveals an active site enclosed by a flexible loop with two Zn²⁺ ions bridged by a carboxylated lysine and a third Zn coordinating a rare histidinate ion. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays prove the involvement of the Zn and flexible loop in catalysis. Comparison with homologous bacterial enzymes supports a reclassification of the DHOase family and provides strong evidence against current models of the architecture of CAD.	eng	185	198	Structure (London, England : 1993)	22	2	2014	Feb	04	D000595;D001221/Q000737;D001426/Q000378;D002223/Q000737;D002384;D020134;D002460;D004260;D004080/Q000737;D004926/Q000201;D057809;D006639/Q000737;D006801;D006863;D007477;D008239/Q000737;D008969;D016297;D009369/Q000378;D010766;D010802;D011485;D055503;D017386;D015032/Q000737	Amino Acid Sequence;Aspartate Carbamoyltransferase/chemistry;Bacterial Proteins/metabolism;Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Glutamine-Hydrolyzing)/chemistry;Catalysis;Catalytic Domain;Cell Line;DNA Repair;Dihydroorotase/chemistry;Escherichia coli/enzymology;HEK293 Cells;Histidine/chemistry;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Ions;Lysine/chemistry;Molecular Sequence Data;Mutagenesis, Site-Directed;Neoplasms/metabolism;Phosphorylation;Phylogeny;Protein Binding;Protein Multimerization;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Zinc/chemistry	Grande-García A;Lallous N;Díaz-Tejada C;Ramón-Maiques S	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.str.2013.10.016			False
1190	25075345	Structure and function study of the complex that synthesizes S-adenosylmethionine.	S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is the principal methyl donor of the cell and is synthesized via an ATP-driven process by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) enzymes. It is tightly linked with cell proliferation in liver and colon cancer. In humans, there are three genes, mat1A, mat2A and mat2B, which encode MAT enzymes. mat2A and mat2B transcribe MATα2 and MATβ enzyme subunits, respectively, with catalytic and regulatory roles. The MATα2β complex is expressed in nearly all tissues and is thought to be essential in providing the necessary SAMe flux for methylation of DNA and various proteins including histones. In human hepatocellular carcinoma mat2A and mat2B genes are upregulated, highlighting the importance of the MATα2β complex in liver disease. The individual subunits have been structurally characterized but the nature of the complex has remained elusive despite its existence having been postulated for more than 20 years and the observation that MATβ is often co-localized with MATα2. Though SAMe can be produced by MAT(α2)4 alone, this paper shows that the V max of the MATα2β complex is three- to fourfold higher depending on the variants of MATβ that participate in complex formation. Using X-ray crystallography and solution X-ray scattering, the first structures are provided of this 258 kDa functional complex both in crystals and solution with an unexpected stoichiometry of 4α2 and 2βV2 subunits. It is demonstrated that the N-terminal regulates the activity of the complex and it is shown that complex formation takes place surprisingly via the C-terminal of MATβV2 that buries itself in a tunnel created at the interface of the MAT(α2)2.

The molecular mechanisms causing the loss of dopaminergic neurons containing neuromelanin in the substantia nigra and responsible for motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are still unknown. The discovery of genes associated with Parkinson's disease (such as alpha synuclein (SNCA), E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (parkin), DJ-1 (PARK7), ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCHL-1), serine/threonine-protein kinase (PINK-1), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), cation-transporting ATPase 13A1 (ATP13A), etc.) contributed enormously to basic research towards understanding the role of these proteins in the sporadic form of the disease. However, it is generally accepted by the scientific community that mitochondria dysfunction, alpha synuclein aggregation, dysfunction of protein degradation, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are involved in neurodegeneration. Dopamine oxidation seems to be a complex pathway in which dopamine o-quinone, aminochrome and 5,6-indolequinone are formed. However, both dopamine o-quinone and 5,6-indolequinone are so unstable that is difficult to study and separate their roles in the degenerative process occurring in Parkinson's disease. Dopamine oxidation to dopamine o-quinone, aminochrome and 5,6-indolequinone seems to play an important role in the neurodegenerative processes of Parkinson's disease as aminochrome induces: (i) mitochondria dysfunction, (ii) formation and stabilization of neurotoxic protofibrils of alpha synuclein, (iii) protein degradation dysfunction of both proteasomal and lysosomal systems and (iv) oxidative stress. The neurotoxic effects of aminochrome in dopaminergic neurons can be inhibited by: (i) preventing dopamine oxidation of the transporter that takes up dopamine into monoaminergic vesicles with low pH and dopamine oxidative deamination catalyzed by monoamino oxidase (ii) dopamine o-quinone, aminochrome and 5,6-indolequinone polymerization to neuromelanin and (iii) two-electron reduction of aminochrome catalyzed by DT-diaphorase. Furthermore, dopamine conversion to NM seems to have a dual role, protective and toxic, depending mostly on the cellular context. Dopamine oxidation to dopamine o-quinone, aminochrome and 5,6-indolequinone plays an important role in neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease since they induce mitochondria and protein degradation dysfunction; formation of neurotoxic alpha synuclein protofibrils and oxidative stress. However, the cells have a protective system against dopamine oxidation composed by dopamine uptake mediated by Vesicular monoaminergic transporter-2 (VMAT-2), neuromelanin formation, two-electron reduction and GSH-conjugation mediated by Glutathione S-transferase M2-2 (GSTM2).	eng	898	915	Journal of neurochemistry	129	6	2014	Jun		D000818;D004298/Q000096;D004298/Q000378;D004298/Q000627;D004298/Q000633;D005978/Q000378;D006801;D045563/Q000378;D008543/Q000378;D008543/Q000502;D008995/Q000378;D010300/Q000209;D010300/Q000517;D011809/Q000378	Animals;Dopamine/biosynthesis;Dopamine/metabolism;Dopamine/therapeutic use;Dopamine/toxicity;Glutathione/metabolism;Humans;Indolequinones/metabolism;Melanins/metabolism;Melanins/physiology;Monoamine Oxidase/metabolism;Parkinson Disease/etiology;Parkinson Disease/prevention & control;Quinones/metabolism	Segura-Aguilar J;Paris I;Muñoz P;Ferrari E;Zecca L;Zucca FA	Journal, Articles					10.1111/jnc.12686			False
1192	24657656	Prostaglandin E3 metabolism and cancer.	The anticancer activity of n-3 fatty acids, especially those derived from fish, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid) (DHA), has been studied for centuries. While there is a growing body of evidence that EPA and DHA may influence cancer initiation and development through targeting multiple events of tumor development, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these activities are still not fully understood. A number of studies have suggested that the anticancer activities of EPA and DHA are associated with their effects on eicosanoid metabolism by which they inhibit prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. In contrast to DHA, EPA can function as a substrate for cyclooxygenases (COXs) to synthesize unique 3-series prostaglandin compounds, especially PGE3. With advance technology in mass spectrometry, there is renewed interest in studying the role of PGE3 in EPA elicited anti-proliferative activity in various cancers, with some promising results. Here, we summarize the regulation of PGE3 synthesis in cancer cells and its role in EPA elicited anticancer activity. The development of PGE3 and its metabolites as potential biomarkers for future clinical evaluation of EPA and fish oil in cancer care is discussed.	eng	1	11	Cancer letters	348	1-2	2014	Jun	28	D000527/Q000031;D000527/Q000378;D000818;D000970/Q000378;D000970/Q000627;D014408/Q000378;D051546/Q000378;D015232/Q000378;D015118/Q000378;D015118/Q000627;D054513/Q000378;D006801;D009369/Q000188;D009369/Q000378;D009369/Q000473;D015398/Q000187	Alprostadil/analogs & derivatives;Alprostadil/metabolism;Animals;Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism;Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use;Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism;Cyclooxygenase 2/metabolism;Dinoprostone/metabolism;Eicosapentaenoic Acid/metabolism;Eicosapentaenoic Acid/therapeutic use;Group IV Phospholipases A2/metabolism;Humans;Neoplasms/drug therapy;Neoplasms/metabolism;Neoplasms/pathology;Signal Transduction/drug effects	Yang P;Jiang Y;Fischer SM	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.canlet.2014.03.010			False
1193	24304836	Functional properties of human ferroportin, a cellular iron exporter reactive also with cobalt and zinc.	Iron homeostasis is achieved by regulating the intestinal absorption of the metal and its recycling by macrophages. Iron export from enterocytes or macrophages to blood plasma is thought to be mediated by ferroportin under the control of hepcidin. Although ferroportin was identified over a decade ago, little is understood about how it works. We expressed in Xenopus oocytes a human ferroportin-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein and observed using confocal microscopy its exclusive plasma-membrane localization. As a first step in its characterization, we established an assay to detect functional expression of ferroportin by microinjecting oocytes with (55)Fe and measuring efflux. Ferroportin expression increased the first-order rate constants describing (55)Fe efflux up to 300-fold over control. Ferroportin-mediated (55)Fe efflux was saturable, temperature-dependent (activation energy, Ea ≈ 17 kcal/mol), maximal at extracellular pH ≈ 7.5, and inactivated at extracellular pH < 6.0. We estimated that ferroportin reacts with iron at its intracellular aspect with apparent affinity constant < 10(-7) M. Ferroportin expression also stimulated efflux of (65)Zn and (57)Co but not of (64)Cu, (109)Cd, or (54)Mn. Hepcidin treatment of oocytes inhibited efflux of (55)Fe, (65)Zn, and (57)Co. Whereas hepcidin administration in mice resulted in a marked hypoferremia within 4 h, we observed no effect on serum zinc levels in those same animals. We conclude that ferroportin is an iron-preferring cellular metal-efflux transporter with a narrow substrate profile that includes cobalt and zinc. Whereas hepcidin strongly regulated serum iron levels in the mouse, we found no evidence that ferroportin plays an important role in zinc homeostasis.	eng	C450	C459	American journal of physiology.

1194	25955826	Ionic Selectivity and Permeation Properties of Human PIEZO1 Channels.	Members of the eukaryotic PIEZO family (the human orthologs are noted hPIEZO1 and hPIEZO2) form cation-selective mechanically-gated channels. We characterized the selectivity of human PIEZO1 (hPIEZO1) for alkali ions: K+, Na+, Cs+ and Li+; organic cations: TMA and TEA, and divalents: Ba2+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+. All monovalent ions permeated the channel. At a membrane potential of -100 mV, Cs+, Na+ and K+ had chord conductances in the range of 35-55 pS with the exception of Li+, which had a significantly lower conductance of ~ 23 pS. The divalents decreased the single-channel permeability of K+, presumably because the divalents permeated slowly and occupied the open channel for a significant fraction of the time. In cell-attached mode, 90 mM extracellular divalents had a conductance for inward currents carried by the divalents of: 25 pS for Ba2+ and 15 pS for Ca2+ at -80 mV and 10 pS for Mg2+ at -50 mV. The organic cations, TMA and TEA, permeated slowly and attenuated K+ currents much like the divalents. As expected, the channel K+ conductance increased with K+ concentration saturating at ~ 45 pS and the KD of K+ for the channel was 32 mM. Pure divalent ion currents were of lower amplitude than those with alkali ions and the channel opening rate was lower in the presence of divalents than in the presence of monovalents. Exposing cells to the actin disrupting reagent cytochalasin D increased the frequency of openings in cell-attached patches probably by reducing mechanoprotection.	eng	e0125503		PloS one	10	5	2015			D002413;D002414;D002463/Q000187;D015638/Q000494;D015870;D057809;D006801;D007473/Q000235;D007473/Q000378;D017136/Q000187;D008564/Q000187;D008564/Q000502;D008672/Q000378;D008673/Q000378;D019384/Q000494;D018408;D010957/Q000737;D010957/Q000378;D000644/Q000378;D019789/Q000378;D014162	Cations, Divalent;Cations, Monovalent;Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects;Cytochalasin D/pharmacology;Gene Expression;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Ion Channels/genetics;Ion Channels/metabolism;Ion Transport/drug effects;Membrane Potentials/drug effects;Membrane Potentials/physiology;Metals, Alkali/metabolism;Metals, Alkaline Earth/metabolism;Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology;Patch-Clamp Techniques;Plasmids/chemistry;Plasmids/metabolism;Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/metabolism;Tetraethylammonium/metabolism;Transfection	Gnanasambandam R;Bae C;Gottlieb PA;Sachs F	Journal, Articles								False
1195	25998731	Plasma membrane calcium ATPases: From generic Ca(2+) sump pumps to versatile systems for fine-tuning cellular Ca(2.).	"The plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs) are ATP-driven primary ion pumps found in all eukaryotic cells. They are the major high-affinity calcium extrusion system for expulsion of Ca(2+) ions from the cytosol and help restore the low resting levels of intracellular [Ca(2+)] following the temporary elevation of Ca(2+) generated during Ca(2+) signaling. Due to their essential role in the maintenance of cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis they were initially thought to be ""sump pumps"" for Ca(2+) removal needed by all cells to avoid eventual calcium overload. The discovery of multiple PMCA isoforms and alternatively spliced variants cast doubt on this simplistic assumption, and revealed instead that PMCAs are integral components of highly regulated multi-protein complexes fulfilling specific roles in calcium-dependent signaling originating at the plasma membrane. Biochemical, genetic, and physiological studies in gene-manipulated and mutant animals demonstrate the important role played by specific PMCAs in distinct diseases including those affecting the peripheral and central nervous system, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. Human PMCA gene mutations and allelic variants associated with specific disorders continue to be discovered and underline the crucial role of different PMCAs in particular cells, tissues and organs."	eng	26	33	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	460	1	2015	Apr	24	D000818;D002118/Q000378;D020013/Q000502;D000252/Q000378;D002462/Q000378;D006801;D015640/Q000502;D008954	Animals;Calcium/metabolism;Calcium Signaling/physiology;Calcium-Transporting ATPases/metabolism;Cell Membrane/metabolism;Humans;Ion Channel Gating/physiology;Models, Biological	Strehler EE	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.01.121			False
1196	26321286	Endothelial toxicity of unusual nucleotide metabolites.	Endothelium plays a pivotal role in the vascular tone regulation, platelet aggregation, regulation of immune response, inflammation and angiogenesis and its dysfunction is an earliest event in the development of cardiovascular disease. All these processes are affected by endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial toxicity induced by metabolites present in blood is a common scenario in pathology. This involves physiological metabolites such as asymmetric dimethylarginine or homocysteine that are normally excreted by kidneys, but accumulate in pathological conditions, adversely affecting function of endothelium. Our group identified new molecule with potential endothelial toxicity: 4-pirydone-3-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribonucleoside (4PYR). This nucleoside is most likely produced by oxidation of nicotinamide containing precursor by aldehyde oxidase. 4PYR easy crosses cell membrane and become phosphorylated inside the cell giving rise to mono-, di- and triphospates (4PYMP, 4PYDP and 4PYTP). There is considerable evidence that 4PYR is toxic in endothelium and other cell types by disrupting cell energetics evident as ATP depletion. Endothelial dysfunction in the in vitro and in vivo experiments is, however, evident only after prolonged exposure to 4PYR while acute cardiovascular effects are minor. 4PYR endothelial toxicity could be particularly important in patients with chronic renal disease where accumulation of 4PYR and its metabolites is particularly prominent. 4PYR metabolism and toxicity could be blocked by application of nucleoside transport inhibitors and we have proven efficiency of such intervention. We believe that blocking metabolism of endothelial nucleoside toxins such as 4PYR could become important strategy for endothelial targeted therapy.	eng	818	822	Pharmacological reports : PR	67	4	2015	Aug		D000818;D001692/Q000187;D001692/Q000502;D002318/Q000139;D002318/Q000378;D002318/Q000473;D004730/Q000187;D004730/Q000378;D004730/Q000473;D006801;D009711/Q000378;D009711/Q000633	Animals;Biological Transport/drug effects;Biological Transport/physiology;Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced;Cardiovascular Diseases/metabolism;Cardiovascular Diseases/pathology;Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects;Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism;Endothelium, Vascular/pathology;Humans;Nucleotides/metabolism;Nucleotides/toxicity	Pelikant-Malecka I;Sielicka A;Kaniewska E;Smolenski RT;Slominska EM	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.pharep.2015.03.020			False
1197	26354748	Mechanisms of ammonia and ammonium transport by rhesus-associated glycoproteins.	In this study we characterized ammonia and ammonium (NH3/NH4(+)) transport by the rhesus-associated (Rh) glycoproteins RhAG, Rhbg, and Rhcg expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We used ion-selective microelectrodes and two-electrode voltage clamp to measure changes in intracellular pH, surface pH, and whole cell currents induced by NH3/NH4(+) and methyl amine/ammonium (MA/MA(+)). These measurements allowed us to define signal-specific signatures to distinguish NH3 from NH4(+) transport and to determine how transport of NH3 and NH4(+) differs among RhAG, Rhbg, and Rhcg. Our data indicate that expression of Rh glycoproteins in oocytes generally enhanced NH3/NH4(+) transport and that cellular changes induced by transport of MA/MA(+) by Rh proteins were different from those induced by transport of NH3/NH4(+). Our results support the following conclusions: 1) RhAG and Rhbg transport both the ionic NH4(+) and neutral NH3 species; 2) transport of NH4(+) is electrogenic; 3) like Rhbg, RhAG transport of NH4(+) masks NH3 transport; and 4) Rhcg is likely to be a predominantly NH3 transporter, with no evidence of enhanced NH4(+) transport by this transporter. The dual role of Rh proteins as NH3 and NH4(+) transporters is a unique property and may be critical in understanding how transepithelial secretion of NH3/NH4(+) occurs in the renal collecting duct.	eng	C747	C758	American journal of physiology.

1198	25371203	Functional characterization of 5-oxoproline transport via SLC16A1/MCT1.	Thyrotropin-releasing hormone is a tripeptide that consists of 5-oxoproline, histidine, and proline. The peptide is rapidly metabolized by various enzymes. 5-Oxoproline is produced by enzymatic hydrolysis in a variety of peptides. Previous studies showed that 5-oxoproline could become a possible biomarker for autism spectrum disorders. Here we demonstrate the involvement of SLC16A1 in the transport of 5-oxoproline. An SLC16A1 polymorphism (rs1049434) was recently identified. However, there is no information about the effect of the polymorphism on SLC16A1 function. In this study, the polymorphism caused an observable change in 5-oxoproline and lactate transport via SLC16A1. The Michaelis constant (Km) was increased in an SLC16A1 mutant compared with that in the wild type. In addition, the proton concentration required to produce half-maximal activation of transport activity (K0.5, H (+)) was increased in the SLC16A1 mutant compared with that in the wild type. Furthermore, we examined the transport of 5-oxoproline in T98G cells as an astrocyte cell model. Despite the fact that 5-oxoproline is an amino acid derivative, Na(+)-dependent and amino acid transport systems scarcely contributed to 5-oxoproline transport. Based on our findings, we conclude that H(+)-coupled 5-oxoproline transport is mediated solely by SLC16A1 in the cells.	eng	2303	2311	The Journal of biological chemistry	290	4	2015	Jan	23	D000818;D001253/Q000378;D001692;D001921/Q000378;D020134;D045744;D014644;D006801;D027501/Q000378;D016297;D020125;D009865;D011110;D020641;D011522;D011761/Q000378;D012333/Q000378;D027981/Q000378;D014982	Animals;Astrocytes/metabolism;Biological Transport;Brain/metabolism;Catalytic Domain;Cell Line, Tumor;Genetic Variation;Humans;Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters/metabolism;Mutagenesis, Site-Directed;Mutation, Missense;Oocytes;Polymorphism, Genetic;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Protons;Pyrrolidonecarboxylic Acid/metabolism;RNA, Messenger/metabolism;Symporters/metabolism;Xenopus laevis	Sasaki S;Futagi Y;Kobayashi M;Ogura J;Iseki K	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.M114.581892			False
1199	25896650	Lack of the nucleoside transporter ENT1 results in the Augustine-null blood type and ectopic mineralization.	The Augustine-negative alias At(a-) blood type, which seems to be restricted to people of African ancestry, was identified half a century ago but remains one of the last blood types with no known genetic basis. Here we report that a nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in SLC29A1 (rs45458701) is responsible for the At(a-) blood type. The resulting p.Glu391Lys variation in the last extracellular loop of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1; also called SLC29a1) is known not to alter its ability to transport nucleosides and nucleoside analog drugs. Furthermore, we identified 3 individuals of European ancestry who are homozygous for a null mutation in SLC29A1 (c.589+1G>C) and thus have the Augustine-null blood type. These individuals lacking ENT1 exhibit periarticular and ectopic mineralization, which confirms an important role for ENT1/SLC29A1 in human bone homeostasis as recently suggested by the skeletal phenotype of aging Slc29a1(-/-) mice. Our results establish Augustine as a new blood group system and place SLC29A1 as a new candidate gene for idiopathic disorders characterized with ectopic calcification/mineralization.	eng	3651	3654	Blood	125	23	2015	Jun	04	D000818;D001789/Q000235;D001789/Q000378;D033721/Q000235;D033721/Q000378;D005260;D006801;D008297;D051379;D018345;D009999/Q000235;D009999/Q000378;D009999/Q000473;D020641;D017433;D044465	Animals;Blood Group Antigens/genetics;Blood Group Antigens/metabolism;Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/genetics;Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/metabolism;Female;Humans;Male;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Ossification, Heterotopic/genetics;Ossification, Heterotopic/metabolism;Ossification, Heterotopic/pathology;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Protein Structure, Secondary;White People	Daniels G;Ballif BA;Helias V;Saison C;Grimsley S;Mannessier L;Hustinx H;Lee E;Cartron JP;Peyrard T;Arnaud L	Journal, Articles					10.1182/blood-2015-03-631598			False
1200	26377792	Human organic anion transporter 2 is distinct from organic anion transporters 1 and 3 with respect to transport function.	Phylogentically, organic anion transporter (OAT)1 and OAT3 are closely related, whereas OAT2 is more distant. Experiments with human embryonic kidney-293 cells stably transfected with human OAT1, OAT2, or OAT3 were performed to compare selected transport properties. Common to OAT1, OAT2, and OAT3 is their ability to transport cGMP. OAT2 interacted with prostaglandins, and cGMP uptake was inhibited by PGE2 and PGF2α with IC50 values of 40.8 and 12.7 μM, respectively. OAT1 (IC50: 23.7 μM), OAT2 (IC50: 9.5 μM), and OAT3 (IC50: 1.6 μM) were potently inhibited by MK571, an established multidrug resistance protein inhibitor. OAT2-mediated cGMP uptake was not inhibited by short-chain monocarboxylates and, as opposed to OAT1 and OAT3, not by dicarboxylates. Consequently, OAT2 showed no cGMP/glutarate exchange. OAT1 and OAT3 exhibited a pH and a Cl- dependence with higher substrate uptake at acidic pH and lower substrate uptake in the absence of Cl-, respectively. Such pH and Cl- dependencies were not observed with OAT2. Depolarization of membrane potential by high K+ concentrations in the presence of the K+ ionophore valinomycin left cGMP uptake unaffected. In addition to cGMP, OAT2 transported urate and glutamate, but cGMP/glutamate exchange could not be demonstrated. These experiments suggest that OAT2-mediated cGMP uptake does not occur via exchange with monocarboxylates, dicarboxylates, and hydroxyl ions. The counter anion for electroneutral cGMP uptake remains to be identified.	eng	F843	F851	American journal of physiology.

1201	26455426	Functional identification of SLC43A3 as an equilibrative nucleobase transporter involved in purine salvage in mammals.	The purine salvage pathway plays a major role in the nucleotide production, relying on the supply of nucleobases and nucleosides from extracellular sources. Although specific transporters have been suggested to be involved in facilitating their transport across the plasma membrane in mammals, those which are specifically responsible for utilization of extracellular nucleobases remain unknown. Here we present the molecular and functional characterization of SLC43A3, an orphan transporter belonging to an amino acid transporter family, as a purine-selective nucleobase transporter. SLC43A3 was highly expressed in the liver, where it was localized to the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes, and the lung. In addition, SLC43A3 expressed in MDCKII cells mediated the uptake of purine nucleobases such as adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine without requiring typical driving ions such as Na(+) and H(+), but it did not mediate the uptake of nucleosides. When SLC43A3 was expressed in APRT/HPRT1-deficient A9 cells, adenine uptake was found to be low. However, it was markedly enhanced by the introduction of SLC43A3 with APRT. In HeLa cells, knock-down of SLC43A3 markedly decreased adenine uptake. These data suggest that SLC43A3 is a facilitative and purine-selective nucleobase transporter that mediates the cellular uptake of extracellular purine nucleobases in cooperation with salvage enzymes.	eng	15057		Scientific reports	5		2015	Oct	12	D000225/Q000378;D000228/Q000037;D000228/Q000235;D000228/Q000378;D000241/Q000378;D026905/Q000037;D026905/Q000235;D026905/Q000378;D000818;D001692;D004285;D033721/Q000037;D033721/Q000235;D033721/Q000378;D057809;D006367;D022781/Q000378;D006801;D019271/Q000378;D008099/Q000378;D008168/Q000378;D061985;D051379;D020033/Q000037;D020033/Q000235;D020033/Q000378;D011687/Q000378;D034741/Q000235;D034741/Q000378;D013936/Q000378;D014529/Q000378	Adenine/metabolism;Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors;Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics;Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase/metabolism;Adenosine/metabolism;Amino Acid Transport Systems/antagonists & inhibitors;Amino Acid Transport Systems/genetics;Amino Acid Transport Systems/metabolism;Animals;Biological Transport;Dogs;Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/antagonists & inhibitors;Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/genetics;Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/metabolism;HEK293 Cells;HeLa Cells;Hepatocytes/metabolism;Humans;Hypoxanthine/metabolism;Liver/metabolism;Lung/metabolism;Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells;Mice;Protein Isoforms/antagonists & inhibitors;Protein Isoforms/genetics;Protein Isoforms/metabolism;Purines/metabolism;RNA, Small Interfering/genetics;RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism;Thymidine/metabolism;Uridine/metabolism	Furukawa J;Inoue K;Maeda J;Yasujima T;Ohta K;Kanai Y;Takada T;Matsuo H;Yuasa H	Journal, Articles								False

However, in the past couple of decades further roles have been assigned to NAD. Here, metabolism of NAD to the Ca²⁺ mobilizing second messengers cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate and adenosine diphosphoribose is reviewed. Moreover, the mechanisms of Ca²⁺ mobilization by these adenine nucleotides and their putative target Ca²⁺ channels, ryanodine receptors and transient receptor potential channels are discussed.

1203	27037871	Human Fumarate Hydratase Is Dual Localized by an Alternative Transcription Initiation Mechanism.	Fumarate hydratase (FH, fumarase), is a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme localized in the mitochondrial matrix. However, a common theme, conserved from yeast to human, is the existence of a large cytosolic population of FH. FH has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor gene and is now implicated in various diseases. We have previously indicated that the cytosolic echoform of FH has a role in the DNA damage response and specifically in the response to DNA double strand breaks. In fact, recently FH has been shown to be involved in histone demethylation. Therefore, it has become important to understand the underlying mechanism of FH dual subcellular location in human cells. We revealed that in human cells, in contrast to yeast, the FH gene encodes two gene products, one containing and one lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence. On the basis of expression of endogenous wild-type FH and mutant FH cDNAs from plasmids, RT-PCR, RACE to determine the 5' termini of FH mRNAs, and mass spectrometry of FH products, we show that the mechanism of FH distribution is alternative transcription initiation from a broad promoter. This is contrary to the suggested mechanism for rat liver cells which had claimed alternative translation initiation.	eng	720	732	Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)	17	7	2016	Jul		D020121/Q000235;D017398/Q000235;D000595;D018929;D003600/Q000201;D005649/Q000235;D005649/Q000378;D057809;D006367;D006801;D007527;D008928/Q000201;D008928/Q000235;D010957;D011401;D014176;D012333/Q000235;D024363;D014158	5' Untranslated Regions/genetics;Alternative Splicing/genetics;Amino Acid Sequence;Cell Culture Techniques;Cytosol/enzymology;Fumarate Hydratase/genetics;Fumarate Hydratase/metabolism;HEK293 Cells;HeLa Cells;Humans;Isoenzymes;Mitochondria/enzymology;Mitochondria/genetics;Plasmids;Promoter Regions, Genetic;Protein Biosynthesis;RNA, Messenger/genetics;Transcription Initiation Site;Transcription, Genetic	Dik E;Naamati A;Asraf H;Lehming N;Pines O	Journal, Articles					10.1111/tra.12397			False
1204	26991725	Elucidation of the interplay between Fe(II), Fe(III), and dopamine with relevance to iron solubilization and reactive oxygen species generation by catecholamines.	The non-enzymatically catalyzed oxidation of dopamine (DA) and the resultant formation of powerful oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical ((•) OH) through 'Fenton chemistry' in the presence of iron within dopaminergic neurons are thought to contribute to the damage of cells or even lead to neuronal degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. An understanding of DA oxidation as well as the transformation of the intermediates that are formed in the presence of iron under physiological conditions is critical to understanding the mechanism of DA and iron induced oxidative stress. In this study, the generation of H2 O2 through the autoxidation and iron-catalyzed oxidation of DA, the formation of the dominant complex via the direct reaction with Fe(II) and Fe(III) in both oxygen saturated and deoxygenated conditions and the oxidation of Fe(II) in the presence of DA at physiological pH 7.4 were investigated. The oxidation of DA resulted in the generation of significant amounts of H2 O2 with this process accelerated significantly in the presence of Fe(II) and Fe(III). At high DA:Fe(II) ratios, the results from this study suggest that DA plays a protective role by complexing Fe(II) and preventing it from reacting with the generated H2 O2 . However, the accumulation of H2 O2 may result in cellular damage as high intracellular H2 O2 concentrations will result in the oxidation of remaining Fe(II) mainly through the peroxidation pathway. At low DA:Fe(II) ratios however, it is likely that DA will act as a pro-oxidant by generating H2 O2 which, in the presence of Fe(II), will result in the production of strongly oxidizing (•) OH radicals. Powerful oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical ((•) OH) have previously been thought to be generated through the interplay between dopamine (DA) and iron, contributing to damage to cells and, potentially, leading to neuronal degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Our results suggest that DA plays a dual role as high DA/Fe(II) ratios prevent Fe(II) from reacting with the generated H2 O2 thereby reducing (•) OH generation, whereas low DA/Fe(II) ratios enhance (•) OH generation as a result of reaction of unbound Fe(II) and H2 O2 produced via both autoxidation and iron-catalyzed oxidation of DA.	eng	955	968	Journal of neurochemistry	137	6	2016	Jun		D000818;D002395/Q000494;D004298/Q000378;D004305;D004347;D005290/Q000378;D005296/Q000378;D006801;D007501/Q000378;D008956;D010084/Q000187;D017382/Q000378	Animals;Catecholamines/pharmacology;Dopamine/metabolism;Dose-Response Relationship, Drug;Drug Interactions;Ferric Compounds/metabolism;Ferrous Compounds/metabolism;Humans;Iron/metabolism;Models, Chemical;Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism	Sun Y;Pham AN;Waite TD	Journal, Articles					10.1111/jnc.13615			False
1205	27257257	ADP-ribose-derived nuclear ATP synthesis by NUDIX5 is required for chromatin remodeling.	Key nuclear processes in eukaryotes, including DNA replication, repair, and gene regulation, require extensive chromatin remodeling catalyzed by energy-consuming enzymes. It remains unclear how the ATP demands of such processes are met in response to rapid stimuli. We analyzed this question in the context of the massive gene regulation changes induced by progestins in breast cancer cells and found that ATP is generated in the cell nucleus via the hydrolysis of poly(ADP-ribose) to ADP-ribose. In the presence of pyrophosphate, ADP-ribose is used by the pyrophosphatase NUDIX5 to generate nuclear ATP. The nuclear source of ATP is essential for hormone-induced chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, and cell proliferation.	eng	1221	1225	Science (New York, N.Y.)	352	6290	2016	Jun	03	D000246/Q000378;D000255/Q000096;D001943/Q000235;D001943/Q000378;D002467/Q000187;D002467/Q000378;D049109;D042002;D018360;D011756/Q000378;D004734;D005260;D005786;D006801;D006868;D061986;D000071137;D011064/Q000378;D011065/Q000235;D011065/Q000378;D011372/Q000378;D011372/Q000494;D055503;D011755/Q000737;D011755/Q000235;D011755/Q000378	Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Adenosine Triphosphate/biosynthesis;Breast Neoplasms/genetics;Breast Neoplasms/metabolism;Cell Nucleus/drug effects;Cell Nucleus/metabolism;Cell Proliferation;Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly;Crystallography, X-Ray;Diphosphates/metabolism;Energy Metabolism;Female;Gene Expression Regulation;Humans;Hydrolysis;MCF-7 Cells;Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1;Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/genetics;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism;Progestins/metabolism;Progestins/pharmacology;Protein Multimerization;Pyrophosphatases/chemistry;Pyrophosphatases/genetics;Pyrophosphatases/metabolism	Wright RH;Lioutas A;Le Dily F;Soronellas D;Pohl A;Bonet J;Nacht AS;Samino S;Font-Mateu J;Vicent GP;Wierer M;Trabado MA;Schelhorn C;Carolis C;Macias MJ;Yanes O;Oliva B;Beato M	Journal, Articles					10.1126/science.aad9335			False
1206	27687724	Crystal Structure of the Acid Sphingomyelinase-like Phosphodiesterase SMPDL3B Provides Insights into Determinants of Substrate Specificity.	The enzyme acid sphingomyelinase-like phosphodiesterase 3B (SMPDL3B) was shown to act as a negative regulator of innate immune signaling, affecting cellular lipid composition and membrane fluidity. Furthermore, several reports identified this enzyme as an off target of the therapeutic antibody rituximab, with implications in kidney disorders. However, structural information for this protein is lacking. Here we present the high resolution crystal structure of murine SMPDL3B, which reveals a substrate binding site strikingly different from its paralogs. The active site is located in a narrow boot-shaped cavity. We identify a unique loop near the active site that appears to impose size constraints on incoming substrates. A structure in complex with phosphocholine indicates that the protein recognizes this head group via an aromatic box, a typical choline-binding motif. Although a potential substrate for SMPDL3B is sphingomyelin, we identify other possible substrates such as CDP-choline, ATP, and ADP. Functional experiments employing structure-guided mutagenesis in macrophages highlight amino acid residues potentially involved in recognition of endogenous substrates. Our study is an important step toward elucidating the specific function of this poorly characterized enzyme.	eng	24054	24064	The Journal of biological chemistry	291	46	2016	Nov	11	D000244/Q000737;D000244/Q000235;D000244/Q000378;D000255/Q000737;D000255/Q000235;D000255/Q000378;D000818;D002794/Q000737;D002794/Q000235;D002794/Q000378;D018360;D054684/Q000737;D054684/Q000235;D054684/Q000378;D051379;D000072417;D017433;D061987;D013109/Q000737;D013109/Q000235;D013109/Q000378;D018411;D013379	Adenosine Diphosphate/chemistry;Adenosine Diphosphate/genetics;Adenosine Diphosphate/metabolism;Adenosine Triphosphate/chemistry;Adenosine Triphosphate/genetics;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Animals;Choline/chemistry;Choline/genetics;Choline/metabolism;Crystallography, X-Ray;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3/chemistry;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3/genetics;Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3/metabolism;Mice;Protein Domains;Protein Structure, Secondary;Sf9 Cells;Sphingomyelins/chemistry;Sphingomyelins/genetics;Sphingomyelins/metabolism;Spodoptera;Substrate Specificity	Gorelik A;Heinz LX;Illes K;Superti-Furga G;Nagar B	Journal, Articles								False
1207	27770805	A disease spectrum for ITPA variation: advances in biochemical and clinical research.	Human ITPase (encoded by the ITPA gene) is a protective enzyme which acts to exclude noncanonical (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphates ((d)NTPs) such as (deoxy)inosine 5'-triphosphate ((d)ITP), from (d)NTP pools. Until the last few years, the importance of ITPase in human health and disease has been enigmatic. In 2009, an article was published demonstrating that ITPase deficiency in mice is lethal. All homozygous null offspring died before weaning as a result of cardiomyopathy due to a defect in the maintenance of quality ATP pools. More recently, a whole exome sequencing project revealed that very rare, severe human ITPA mutation results in early infantile encephalopathy and death. It has been estimated that nearly one third of the human population has an ITPA status which is associated with decreased ITPase activity. ITPA status has been linked to altered outcomes for patients undergoing thiopurine or ribavirin therapy. Thiopurine therapy can be toxic for patients with ITPA polymorphism, however, ITPA polymorphism is associated with improved outcomes for patients undergoing ribavirin treatment. ITPA polymorphism has also been linked to early-onset tuberculosis susceptibility. These data suggest a spectrum of ITPA-related disease exists in human populations. Potentially, ITPA status may affect a large number of patient outcomes, suggesting that modulation of ITPase activity is an important emerging avenue for reducing the number of negative outcomes for ITPA-related disease. Recent biochemical studies have aimed to provide rationale for clinical observations, better understand substrate selectivity and provide a platform for modulation of ITPase activity.	eng	73		Journal of biomedical science	23	1	2016	Oct	22	D005838;D006801;D008661/Q000235;D009154;D020641;D011755/Q000172;D011755/Q000235;D011755/Q000378	Genotype;Humans;Metabolism, Inborn Errors/genetics;Mutation;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Pyrophosphatases/deficiency;Pyrophosphatases/genetics;Pyrophosphatases/metabolism	Burgis NE	Journal, Articles								False
1208	27435091	Loss of SYNJ1 dual phosphatase activity leads to early onset refractory seizures and progressive neurological decline.	SYNJ1 encodes a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase, synaptojanin 1, which contains two consecutive phosphatase domains and plays a prominent role in synaptic vesicle dynamics. Autosomal recessive inherited variants in SYNJ1 have previously been associated with two different neurological diseases: a recurrent homozygous missense variant (p.Arg258Gln) that abolishes Sac1 phosphatase activity was identified in three independent families with early onset parkinsonism, whereas a homozygous nonsense variant (p.Arg136*) causing a severe decrease of mRNA transcript was found in a single patient with intractable epilepsy and tau pathology. We performed whole exome or genome sequencing in three independent sib pairs with early onset refractory seizures and progressive neurological decline, and identified novel segregating recessive SYNJ1 defects. A homozygous missense variant resulting in an amino acid substitution (p.Tyr888Cys) was found to impair, but not abolish, the dual phosphatase activity of SYNJ1, whereas three premature stop variants (homozygote p.Trp843* and compound heterozygote p.Gln647Argfs*6/p.Ser1122Thrfs*3) almost completely abolished mRNA transcript production. A genetic follow-up screening in a large cohort of 543 patients with a wide phenotypical range of epilepsies and intellectual disability revealed no additional pathogenic variants, showing that SYNJ1 deficiency is rare and probably linked to a specific phenotype. While variants leading to early onset parkinsonism selectively abolish Sac1 function, our results provide evidence that a critical reduction of the dual phosphatase activity of SYNJ1 underlies a severe disorder with neonatal refractory epilepsy and a neurodegenerative disease course. These findings further expand the clinical spectrum of synaptic dysregulation in patients with severe epilepsy, and emphasize the importance of this biological pathway in seizure pathophysiology.	eng	2420	2430	Brain : a journal of neurology	139	Pt 9	2016	Sep		D017668;D002648;D002675;D015331;D003241;D000069279/Q000235;D059472;D005260;D006801;D008297;D009419/Q000235;D019636/Q000235;D010375;D010641;D010744/Q000235	Age of Onset;Child;Child, Preschool;Cohort Studies;Consanguinity;Drug Resistant Epilepsy/genetics;Exome;Female;Humans;Male;Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics;Neurodegenerative Diseases/genetics;Pedigree;Phenotype;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/genetics	Hardies K;Cai Y;Jardel C;Jansen AC;Cao M;May P;Djémié T;Hachon Le Camus C;Keymolen K;Deconinck T;Bhambhani V;Long C;Sajan SA;Helbig KL;None None;Suls A;Balling R;Helbig I;De Jonghe P;Depienne C;De Camilli P;Weckhuysen S	Journal, Articles					10.1093/brain/aww180			False

1210	27642551	Differential heme release from various hemoglobin redox states and the upregulation of cellular heme oxygenase-1.	Despite advances in our understanding of the oxidative pathways mediated by free hemoglobin (Hb), the precise contribution of its highly reactive redox forms to tissue and organ toxicities remains ambiguous. Heme, a key degradation byproduct of Hb oxidation, has recently been recognized as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule, able to trigger inflammatory responses. Equally damaging is the interaction of the highly redox active forms of Hb with other biological molecules. We determined the kinetics of heme loss from individual Hb redox states-ferrous (Fe(2+)), ferric (Fe(3+)), and ferryl (Fe(4+))-using two different heme receptor proteins: hemopexin (Hxp), a naturally occurring heme scavenger in plasma, and a double mutant (H64Y/V86F), apomyoglobin (ApoMb), which avidly binds heme released from Hb. We show for the first time that ferric Hb (Fe(3+)) loses heme at rates substantially higher than that of ferryl Hb (Fe(4+)). This was also supported by a higher expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) when ferric Hb was added to cultured lung alveolar epithelial cells (E10). The reported cytotoxicity of Hb may therefore be attributed to a combination of accelerated heme loss from the ferric form and protein radical formation associated with ferryl Hb. Targeted therapeutic interventions can therefore be designed to curb specific oxidative pathways of Hb in hemolytic anemias and when Hb is used as an oxygen-carrying therapeutic.	eng	876	884	FEBS open bio	6	9	2016	Sep				Kassa T;Jana S;Meng F;Alayash AI	Journal, Articles					10.1002/2211-5463.12103			False
1211	28373563	Nit1 is a metabolite repair enzyme that hydrolyzes deaminated glutathione.	"The mammalian gene <i>Nit1</i> (nitrilase-like protein 1) encodes a protein that is highly conserved in eukaryotes and is thought to act as a tumor suppressor. Despite being ∼35% sequence identical to ω-amidase (Nit2), the Nit1 protein does not hydrolyze efficiently α-ketoglutaramate (a known physiological substrate of Nit2), and its actual enzymatic function has so far remained a puzzle. In the present study, we demonstrate that both the mammalian Nit1 and its yeast ortholog are amidases highly active toward deaminated glutathione (dGSH; i.e., a form of glutathione in which the free amino group has been replaced by a carbonyl group). We further show that <i>Nit1</i>-KO mutants of both human and yeast cells accumulate dGSH and the same compound is excreted in large amounts in the urine of <i>Nit1</i>-KO mice. Finally, we show that several mammalian aminotransferases (transaminases), both cytosolic and mitochondrial, can form dGSH via a common (if slow) side-reaction and provide indirect evidence that transaminases are mainly responsible for dGSH formation in cultured mammalian cells. Altogether, these findings delineate a typical instance of metabolite repair, whereby the promiscuous activity of some abundant enzymes of primary metabolism leads to the formation of a useless and potentially harmful compound, which needs a suitable ""repair enzyme"" to be destroyed or reconverted into a useful metabolite. The need for a dGSH repair reaction does not appear to be limited to eukaryotes: We demonstrate that Nit1 homologs acting as excellent dGSH amidases also occur in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and other glutathione-producing bacteria."	eng	E3233	E3242	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	114	16	2017	Apr	18	D000619/Q000378;D000619/Q000502;D000818;D003641;D005978/Q000378;D006801;D006868;D051379;D018345;D029701/Q000378;D013379;D000637/Q000378	Aminohydrolases/metabolism;Aminohydrolases/physiology;Animals;Deamination;Glutathione/metabolism;Humans;Hydrolysis;Mice;Mice, Knockout;Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/metabolism;Substrate Specificity;Transaminases/metabolism	Peracchi A;Veiga-da-Cunha M;Kuhara T;Ellens KW;Paczia N;Stroobant V;Seliga AK;Marlaire S;Jaisson S;Bommer GT;Sun J;Huebner K;Linster CL;Cooper AJL;Van Schaftingen E	Journal, Articles					10.1073/pnas.1613736114			False

Retinal dehydrogenase 1 (RALDH1) is a cytosolic enzyme which acts both as a source of retinoic acid (RA) and as a detoxification enzyme. RALDH1 has key functions in the midbrain dopaminergic system, which influences motivation, cognition, and social behavior. Since dopamine has been increasingly linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we asked whether RALDH1 could contribute to the autistic phenotype. Therefore, we investigated for the first time the levels of RALDH1 in autistic patients. To further assess the detoxification function of RALDH1, we also explored 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts (4-HNE PAs) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. Moreover, considering the effect of testosterone on RALDH1 expression, we measured the second to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D ratio) for both hands, which reflects exposure to prenatal testosterone.	eng	229	236	Clinical psychopharmacology and neuroscience : the official scientific journal of the Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology	15	3	2017	Aug	31			Pavăl D;Rad F;Rusu R;Niculae AŞ;Colosi HA;Dobrescu I;Dronca E	Journal, Articles					10.9758/cpn.2017.15.3.229			False
1213	27935710	Quantification of ATP7B Protein in Dried Blood Spots by Peptide Immuno-SRM as a Potential Screen for Wilson's Disease.	Wilson's Disease (WD), a copper transport disorder caused by a genetic defect in the ATP7B gene, has been a long time strong candidate for newborn screening (NBS), since early interventions can give better results by preventing irreversible neurological disability or liver cirrhosis. Several previous pilot studies measuring ceruloplasmin (CP) in infants or children showed that this marker alone was insufficient to meet the universal screening for WD. WD results from mutations that cause absent or markedly diminished levels of ATP7B. Therefore, ATP7B could serve as a marker for the screening of WD, if the protein can be detected from dried blood spots (DBS). This study demonstrates that the immuno-SRM platform can quantify ATP7B in DBS in the picomolar range, and that the assay readily distinguishes affected cases from normal controls (p < 0.0001). The assay precision was <10% CV, and the protein was stable for a week in DBS at room temperature. These promising proof-of-concept data open up the possibility of screening WD in newborns and the potential for a multiplexed assay for screening a variety of congenital disorders using proteins as biomarkers in DBS.	eng	862	871	Journal of proteome research	16	2	2017	Feb	03	D000251/Q000097;D000251/Q000235;D000595;D015415/Q000097;D027682/Q000097;D027682/Q000235;D002853/Q000379;D000073840;D059788;D005260;D015870;D006527/Q000097;D006527/Q000175;D006527/Q000235;D006801;D007231;D008297;D009154;D015997/Q000379;D015588;D010446/Q000032;D012680;D053719/Q000379;D014357/Q000737	Adenosine Triphosphatases/blood;Adenosine Triphosphatases/genetics;Amino Acid Sequence;Biomarkers/blood;Cation Transport Proteins/blood;Cation Transport Proteins/genetics;Chromatography, Liquid/methods;Copper-Transporting ATPases;Dried Blood Spot Testing;Female;Gene Expression;Hepatolenticular Degeneration/blood;Hepatolenticular Degeneration/diagnosis;Hepatolenticular Degeneration/genetics;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Male;Mutation;Neonatal Screening/methods;Observer Variation;Peptide Fragments/analysis;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods;Trypsin/chemistry	Jung S;Whiteaker JR;Zhao L;Yoo HW;Paulovich AG;Hahn SH	Journal, Articles					10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00828			False
1214	27759477	Equilibrative nucleoside transporters-A review.	Equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) are polytopic integral membrane proteins that mediate the transport of nucleosides, nucleobases, and therapeutic analogs. The best-characterized ENTs are the human transporters hENT1 and hENT2. However, non-mammalian eukaryotic ENTs have also been studied (e.g., yeast, parasitic protozoa). ENTs are major pharmaceutical targets responsible for modulating the efficacy of more than 30 approved drugs. However, the molecular mechanisms and chemical determinants of ENT-mediated substrate recognition, binding, inhibition, and transport are poorly understood. This review highlights findings on the characterization of ENTs by surveying studies on genetics, permeant and inhibitor interactions, mutagenesis, and structural models of ENT function.	eng	7	30	Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids	36	1	2017	Jan	02	D000818;D033721/Q000378;D055786;D006801;D058990/Q000379;D016296;D009369/Q000378;D009369/Q000401;D033703/Q000037;D033703/Q000737;D033703/Q000235;D033703/Q000378;D020641;D015800/Q000378	Animals;Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1/metabolism;Gene Knockout Techniques;Humans;Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods;Mutagenesis;Neoplasms/metabolism;Neoplasms/mortality;Nucleoside Transport Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors;Nucleoside Transport Proteins/chemistry;Nucleoside Transport Proteins/genetics;Nucleoside Transport Proteins/metabolism;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Protozoan Proteins/metabolism	Boswell-Casteel RC;Hays FA	Journal, Articles					10.1080/15257770.2016.1210805			False
1215	28323211	Metabolic pathway of 4-pyridone-3-carboxamide-1β-d-ribonucleoside and its effects on cellular energetics.	4-pirydone-3-carboxamide-1β-d-ribonucleoside (4PYR) is an endogenous nucleoside that could be converted to triphosphates, diphosphates, monophosphates and an analogue of NAD - 4PYRAD. Elevated level of these compounds have been reported in chronic renal failure, cancer and active HIV infection. However, little is known about the effect on cell functionality and the metabolic pathways. This study tested effects of 4PYR in different cell types on nucleotide, energy metabolism and clarified enzymes that are involved in conversions of 4PYR. We have found that human neuroblastoma cells, human malignant melanoma cells, human adipose-derived stem cells, human bone marrow-derived stem cells, human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and human embryonic kidney cells, were capable to convert 4PYR into its derivatives. This was associated with deterioration of cellular energetics. Incubation with 4PYR did not affect mitochondrial function, but decreased glycolytic rate (as measured by extracellular acidification) in endothelial cells. Silencing of adenosine kinase, cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II and nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 3, blocked metabolism of 4PYR. Incubation of endothelial cells with 4PYR decreased AMP deaminase activity by 40%. The main finding of this paper is that human cells (including cancer type) are capable of metabolizing 4PYR that lead to deterioration of energy metabolism, possibly as the consequence of inhibition of glycolysis. This study, it was also found that several enzymes of nucleotide metabolism could also contribute to the 4PYRconversions.	eng	31	43	The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology	88		2017	Jul		D045744;D042783/Q000166;D042783/Q000187;D042783/Q000201;D042783/Q000378;D004734/Q000187;D006019/Q000187;D006801;D053858/Q000187;D008928/Q000187;D008928/Q000378;D009705/Q000378;D009705/Q000494;D011728/Q000378;D011728/Q000494	Cell Line, Tumor;Endothelial Cells/cytology;Endothelial Cells/drug effects;Endothelial Cells/enzymology;Endothelial Cells/metabolism;Energy Metabolism/drug effects;Glycolysis/drug effects;Humans;Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects;Mitochondria/drug effects;Mitochondria/metabolism;Nucleosides/metabolism;Nucleosides/pharmacology;Pyridones/metabolism;Pyridones/pharmacology	Pelikant-Malecka I;Kaniewska-Bednarczuk E;Szrok S;Sielicka A;Sledzinski M;Orlewska C;Smolenski RT;Slominska EM	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.biocel.2017.03.012			False
1216	28393572	The role of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) in human disease and therapy.	S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), or ADH5, is an enzyme in the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) family. It is unique when compared to other ADH enzymes in that primary short-chain alcohols are not its principle substrate. GSNOR metabolizes S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), S-hydroxymethylglutathione (the spontaneous adduct of formaldehyde and glutathione), and some alcohols. GSNOR modulates reactive nitric oxide (•NO) availability in the cell by catalyzing the breakdown of GSNO, and indirectly regulates S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs) through GSNO-mediated protein S-nitrosation. The dysregulation of GSNOR can significantly alter cellular homeostasis, leading to disease. GSNOR plays an important regulatory role in smooth muscle relaxation, immune function, inflammation, neuronal development and cancer progression, among many other processes. In recent years, the therapeutic inhibition of GSNOR has been investigated to treat asthma, cystic fibrosis and interstitial lung disease (ILD). The direct action of •NO on cellular pathways, as well as the important regulatory role of protein S-nitrosation, is closely tied to GSNOR regulation and defines this enzyme as an important therapeutic target.	eng	340	354	Critical reviews in biochemistry and molecular biology	52	3	2017	Jun		D000445/Q000378;D001249/Q000201;D001249/Q000628;D003550/Q000201;D003550/Q000628;D006801;D009126;D009130/Q000201;D009363/Q000378;D009369/Q000201;D009369/Q000628;D009474/Q000201;D009569/Q000378;D026422/Q000378	Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Asthma/enzymology;Asthma/therapy;Cystic Fibrosis/enzymology;Cystic Fibrosis/therapy;Humans;Muscle Relaxation;Muscle, Smooth/enzymology;Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism;Neoplasms/enzymology;Neoplasms/therapy;Neurons/enzymology;Nitric Oxide/metabolism;S-Nitrosoglutathione/metabolism	Barnett SD;Buxton ILO	Journal, Articles					10.1080/10409238.2017.1304353			False
1217	29192381	ABCB6, an ABC Transporter Impacting Drug Response and Disease.	Recent findings have discovered how insufficiency of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCB6, can negatively impact human health. These advances were made possible by, first, finding that ABCB6 deficiency was the genetic basis for some severe transfusion reactions and by, second, determining that functionally impaired ABCB6 variants enhanced the severity of porphyria, i.e., diseases associated with defects in heme synthesis. ABCB6 is a broad-spectrum porphyrin transporter that is capable of both exporting and importing heme and its precursors across the plasma membrane and outer mitochondrial membrane, respectively. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that while ABCB6 influences the antioxidant system by reducing the levels of reactive oxygen species, the exact mechanism is currently unknown, though effects on heme synthesis are likely. Furthermore, it is unknown what biochemical or cellular signals determine where ABCB6 localizes in the cell. This review highlights the major recent findings on ABCB6 and focuses on details of its structure, mechanism, transport, contributions to cellular stress, and current clinical implications.	eng	8		The AAPS journal	20	1	2017	Nov	30	D018528/Q000032;D018528/Q000737;D018528/Q000235;D018528/Q000502;D001692;D006801;D013312	ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/chemistry;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics;ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/physiology;Biological Transport;Humans;Stress, Physiological	Boswell-Casteel RC;Fukuda Y;Schuetz JD	Journal, Articles					10.1208/s12248-017-0165-6			False
1218	28590356	Plasma succinate is a predictor of mortality in critically injured patients.	Trauma is the leading cause of mortality under the age of 40 years. Recent observations on metabolic reprogramming during hypoxia and ischemia indicate that hypoxic mitochondrial uncoupling promotes the generation of succinate, which in turn mediates reperfusion injury and inflammatory sequelae upon reoxygenation. Plasma levels of succinate significantly increase in response to trauma and hemorrhage in experimental models and clinical samples, suggesting that succinate may represent a candidate marker of systemic perfusion in trauma.	eng	491	495	The journal of trauma and acute care surgery	83	3	2017	Sep		D000328;D015415/Q000097;D003120;D016638;D005260;D006801;D007773/Q000097;D008297;D013058;D055432/Q000379;D010949;D011237;D011379;D019802/Q000097;D014193;D014947/Q000097;D014947/Q000401	Adult;Biomarkers/blood;Colorado;Critical Illness;Female;Humans;Lactates/blood;Male;Mass Spectrometry;Metabolomics/methods;Plasma;Predictive Value of Tests;Prognosis;Succinic Acid/blood;Trauma Centers;Wounds and Injuries/blood;Wounds and Injuries/mortality	DʼAlessandro A;Moore HB;Moore EE;Reisz JA;Wither MJ;Ghasasbyan A;Chandler J;Silliman CC;Hansen KC;Banerjee A	Journal, Articles					10.1097/TA.0000000000001565			False
1219	30272000	Structural basis for promotion of duodenal iron absorption by enteric ferric reductase with ascorbate.	Dietary iron absorption is regulated by duodenal cytochrome <i>b</i> (Dcytb), an integral membrane protein that catalyzes reduction of nonheme Fe<sup>3+</sup> by electron transfer from ascorbate across the membrane. This step is essential to enable iron uptake by the divalent metal transporter. Here we report the crystallographic structures of human Dcytb and its complex with ascorbate and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Each monomer of the homodimeric protein possesses cytoplasmic and apical heme groups, as well as cytoplasmic and apical ascorbate-binding sites located adjacent to each heme. Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordinates to two hydroxyl groups of the apical ascorbate and to a histidine residue. Biochemical analysis indicates that Fe<sup>3+</sup> competes with Zn<sup>2+</sup> for this binding site. These results provide a structural basis for the mechanism by which Fe<sup>3+</sup> uptake is promoted by reducing agents and should facilitate structure-based development of improved agents for absorption of orally administered iron.	eng	120		Communications biology	1		2018					Ganasen M;Togashi H;Takeda H;Asakura H;Tosha T;Yamashita K;Hirata K;Nariai Y;Urano T;Yuan X;Hamza I;Mauk AG;Shiro Y;Sugimoto H;Sawai H	Journal, Articles								False
1220	30385504	Conjugation of urate-derived electrophiles to proteins during normal metabolism and inflammation.	Urate is often viewed as an antioxidant. Here, we present an alternative perspective by showing that, when oxidized, urate propagates oxidative stress. Oxidation converts urate to the urate radical and the electrophilic products dehydrourate, 5-hydroxyisourate, and urate hydroperoxide, which eventually break down to allantoin. We investigated whether urate-derived electrophiles are intercepted by nucleophilic amino acid residues to form stable adducts on proteins. When urate was oxidized in the presence of various peptides and proteins, two adducts derived from urate (<i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 167 Da) were detected and had mass additions of 140 and 166 Da, occurring mainly on lysine residues and N-terminal amines. The adduct with a 140-Da mass addition was detected more frequently and was stable. Dehydrourate (<i>M</i><sub>r</sub> 166 Da) also formed transient adducts with cysteine residues. Urate-derived adducts were detected on human serum albumin in plasma of healthy donors. Basal adduct levels increased when neutrophils were added to plasma and stimulated, and relied on the NADPH oxidase, myeloperoxidase, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide. Adducts of oxidized urate on serum albumin were elevated in plasma and synovial fluid from individuals with gout and rheumatoid arthritis. We propose that rather than acting as an antioxidant, urate's conversion to electrophiles contributes to oxidative stress. The addition of urate-derived electrophiles to nucleophilic amino acid residues, a process we call oxidative uratylation, will leave a footprint on proteins that could alter their function when critical sites are modified.	eng	19886	19898	The Journal of biological chemistry	293	51	2018	Dec	21	D000588/Q000737;D000595;D004789/Q000187;D024581/Q000378;D006801;D007249/Q000378;D008958;D010084;D018384/Q000187;D011487;D012709/Q000737;D012709/Q000378;D014527/Q000737;D014527/Q000378;D014527/Q000494	Amines/chemistry;Amino Acid Sequence;Enzyme Activation/drug effects;Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (Phosphorylating)/metabolism;Humans;Inflammation/metabolism;Models, Molecular;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress/drug effects;Protein Conformation;Serum Albumin/chemistry;Serum Albumin/metabolism;Uric Acid/chemistry;Uric Acid/metabolism;Uric Acid/pharmacology	Turner R;Brennan SO;Ashby LV;Dickerhof N;Hamzah MR;Pearson JF;Stamp LK;Kettle AJ	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.RA118.005237			False
1221	29255262	Mutations in SELENBP1, encoding a novel human methanethiol oxidase, cause extraoral halitosis.	Selenium-binding protein 1 (SELENBP1) has been associated with several cancers, although its exact role is unknown. We show that SELENBP1 is a methanethiol oxidase (MTO), related to the MTO in methylotrophic bacteria, that converts methanethiol to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, formaldehyde, and H<sub>2</sub>S, an activity not previously known to exist in humans. We identified mutations in SELENBP1 in five patients with cabbage-like breath odor. The malodor was attributable to high levels of methanethiol and dimethylsulfide, the main odorous compounds in their breath. Elevated urinary excretion of dimethylsulfoxide was associated with MTO deficiency. Patient fibroblasts had low SELENBP1 protein levels and were deficient in MTO enzymatic activity; these effects were reversed by lentivirus-mediated expression of wild-type SELENBP1. Selenbp1-knockout mice showed biochemical characteristics similar to those in humans. Our data reveal a potentially frequent inborn error of metabolism that results from MTO deficiency and leads to a malodor syndrome.	eng	120	129	Nature genetics	50	1	2018	Jan		D000818;D001944;D002460;D002478;D004121/Q000097;D004121/Q000134;D004121/Q000652;D006209/Q000201;D006209/Q000235;D006801;D008810;D018345;D009154;D010088/Q000235;D051137/Q000172;D051137/Q000235;D051137/Q000378	Animals;Breath Tests;Cell Line;Cells, Cultured;Dimethyl Sulfoxide/blood;Dimethyl Sulfoxide/cerebrospinal fluid;Dimethyl Sulfoxide/urine;Halitosis/enzymology;Halitosis/genetics;Humans;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;Mutation;Oxidoreductases/genetics;Selenium-Binding Proteins/deficiency;Selenium-Binding Proteins/genetics;Selenium-Binding Proteins/metabolism	Pol A;Renkema GH;Tangerman A;Winkel EG;Engelke UF;de Brouwer APM;Lloyd KC;Araiza RS;van den Heuvel L;Omran H;Olbrich H;Oude Elberink M;Gilissen C;Rodenburg RJ;Sass JO;Schwab KO;Schäfer H;Venselaar H;Sequeira JS;Op den Camp HJM;Wevers RA	Journal, Articles					10.1038/s41588-017-0006-7			False

1223	29220697	Metabolism of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and Production of Reactive Sulfur Species (RSS) by superoxide dismutase.	"Reactive sulfur species (RSS) such as H<sub>2</sub>S, HS<sup>•</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>n</sub>, (n = 2-7) and HS<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> are chemically similar to H<sub>2</sub>O and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) HO<sup>•</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> and act on common biological effectors. RSS were present in evolution long before ROS, and because both are metabolized by catalase it has been suggested that ""antioxidant"" enzymes originally evolved to regulate RSS and may continue to do so today. Here we examined RSS metabolism by Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) using amperometric electrodes for dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S, a polysulfide-specific fluorescent probe (SSP4), and mass spectrometry to identify specific polysulfides (H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>). H<sub>2</sub>S was concentration- and oxygen-dependently oxidized by 1μM SOD to polysulfides (mainly H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, and to a lesser extent H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>) with an EC<sub>50</sub> of approximately 380μM H<sub>2</sub>S. H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations > 750μM inhibited SOD oxidation (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.25mM) with complete inhibition when H<sub>2</sub>S > 1.75mM. Polysulfides were not metabolized by SOD. SOD oxidation preferred dissolved H<sub>2</sub>S over hydrosulfide anion (HS<sup>-</sup>), whereas HS<sup>-</sup> inhibited polysulfide production. In hypoxia, other possible electron donors such as nitrate, nitrite, sulfite, sulfate, thiosulfate and metabisulfite were ineffective. Manganese SOD also catalyzed H<sub>2</sub>S oxidation to form polysulfides, but did not metabolize polysulfides indicating common attributes of these SODs. These experiments suggest that, unlike the well-known SOD-mediated dismutation of two O<sub>2</sub><sup>•-</sup> to form H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup><sub>,</sub></sup> SOD catalyzes a reaction using H<sub>2</sub>S and O<sub>2</sub> to form persulfide. These can then combine in various ways to form polysulfides and sulfur oxides. It is also possible that H<sub>2</sub>S (or polysulfides) interact/react with SOD cysteines to affect catalytic activity or to directly contribute to sulfide metabolism. Our studies suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S metabolism by SOD may have been an ancient mechanism to detoxify sulfide or to regulate RSS and along with catalase may continue to do so in contemporary organisms."	eng	74	85	Redox biology	15		2018	May		D002374/Q000378;D006861/Q000378;D006862/Q000378;D010084;D010100/Q000378;D017382;D013440/Q000378;D013455/Q000378;D013482/Q000378	Catalase/metabolism;Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism;Hydrogen Sulfide/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxygen/metabolism;Reactive Oxygen Species;Sulfides/metabolism;Sulfur/metabolism;Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism	Olson KR;Gao Y;Arif F;Arora K;Patel S;DeLeon ER;Sutton TR;Feelisch M;Cortese-Krott MM;Straub KD	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.redox.2017.11.009			False
1224	30222979	Quinone and nitrofurantoin redox cycling by recombinant cytochrome b5 reductase.	NADH cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> reductase mediates electron transfer from NADH to cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> utilizing flavin adenine dinucleotide as a redox cofactor. Reduced cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> is an important cofactor in many metabolic reactions including cytochrome P450-mediated xenobiotic metabolism, steroid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism, hemoglobin reduction, and methionine and plasmalogen synthesis. Using recombinant human enzyme, we discovered that cytochrome b5 reductase mediates redox cycling of a variety of quinones generating superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and, in the presence of transition metals, hydroxyl radicals. Redox cycling activity was oxygen-dependent and preferentially utilized NADH as a co-substrate; NADH was 5-10 times more active than NADPH in supporting redox cycling. Redox cycling activity was greatest for 9,10-phenanthrenequinone and 1,2-naphthoquinone, followed by 1,4-naphthoquinone and 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione), nitrofurantoin and 2-hydroxyestradiol. Using menadione as the substrate, quinone redox cycling was found to inhibit reduction of cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> by cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> reductase, as measured by heme spectral changes in cytochrome b<sub>5</sub>. Under anaerobic conditions where redox cycling is inhibited, menadione had no effect on the reduction of cytochrome b<sub>5</sub>. Chemical redox cycling by cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> reductase may be important in generating cytotoxic reactive oxygen species in target tissues. This activity, together with the inhibition of cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> reduction by redox-active chemicals and consequent deficiencies in available cellular cytochrome b<sub>5</sub>, are likely to contribute to tissue injury following exposure to quinones and related redox active chemicals.	eng	102	107	Toxicology and applied pharmacology	359		2018	Nov	15	D016227/Q000378;D042966/Q000378;D005609/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008862;D009249/Q000378;D009582/Q000378;D010084;D010101;D017382/Q000378;D011994/Q000378	Benzoquinones/metabolism;Cytochrome-B(5) Reductase/metabolism;Free Radicals/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Microsomes, Liver;NADP/metabolism;Nitrofurantoin/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxygen Consumption;Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins/metabolism	Szilagyi JT;Fussell KC;Wang Y;Jan YH;Mishin V;Richardson JR;Heck DE;Yang S;Aleksunes LM;Laskin DL;Laskin JD	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.taap.2018.09.011			False
1225	30914451	Kinetic and structural analysis of human ALDH9A1.	Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) constitute a superfamily of NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzymes, which detoxify aldehydes produced in various metabolic pathways to the corresponding carboxylic acids. Among the 19 human ALDHs, the cytosolic ALDH9A1 has so far never been fully enzymatically characterized and its structure is still unknown. Here, we report complete molecular and kinetic properties of human ALDH9A1 as well as three crystal forms at 2.3, 2.9, and 2.5 Å resolution. We show that ALDH9A1 exhibits wide substrate specificity to aminoaldehydes, aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes with a clear preference for <i>γ</i>-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde (TMABAL). The structure of ALDH9A1 reveals that the enzyme assembles as a tetramer. Each ALDH monomer displays a typical ALDHs fold composed of an oligomerization domain, a coenzyme domain, a catalytic domain, and an inter-domain linker highly conserved in amino-acid sequence and folding. Nonetheless, structural comparison reveals a position and a fold of the inter-domain linker of ALDH9A1 never observed in any other ALDH so far. This unique difference is not compatible with the presence of a bound substrate and a large conformational rearrangement of the linker up to 30 Å has to occur to allow the access of the substrate channel. Moreover, the αβE region consisting of an α-helix and a β-strand of the coenzyme domain at the dimer interface are disordered, likely due to the loss of interactions with the inter-domain linker, which leads to incomplete β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) binding pocket.	eng			Bioscience reports	39	4	2019	Apr	30	D000444/Q000037;D000444/Q000737;D000444/Q000235;D000444/Q000648;D000595/Q000235;D001665/Q000235;D020134/Q000235;D018360;D006801;D007700;D009243/Q000235;D011487;D017433;D013379/Q000235	Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/chemistry;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/genetics;Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/ultrastructure;Amino Acid Sequence/genetics;Binding Sites/genetics;Catalytic Domain/genetics;Crystallography, X-Ray;Humans;Kinetics;NAD/genetics;Protein Conformation;Protein Structure, Secondary;Substrate Specificity/genetics	Končitíková R;Vigouroux A;Kopečná M;Šebela M;Moréra S;Kopečný D	Journal, Articles								False

ADP-ribosyltransferases transfer ADP-ribose from β-NAD<sup>+</sup> to acceptors; ADP-ribosylated acceptors are cleaved by ADP-ribosyl-acceptor hydrolases (ARHs) and proteins containing ADP-ribose-binding modules termed macrodomains. On the basis of the ADP-ribosyl-arginine hydrolase 1 (ARH1) stereospecific hydrolysis of α-ADP-ribosyl-arginine and the hypothesis that α-NAD<sup>+</sup> is generated as a side product of β-NAD<sup>+</sup>/ NADH metabolism, we proposed that α-NAD<sup>+</sup> was a substrate of ARHs and macrodomain proteins. Here, we report that ARH1, ARH3, and macrodomain proteins (i.e., MacroD1, MacroD2, C6orf130 (TARG1), Af1521, hydrolyzed α-NAD<sup>+</sup> but not β-NAD<sup>+</sup>. ARH3 had the highest α-NADase specific activity. The ARH and macrodomain protein families, in stereospecific reactions, cleave ADP-ribose linkages to N- or O- containing functional groups; anomerization of α- to β-forms (e.g., α-ADP-ribosyl-arginine to β-ADP-ribose- (arginine) protein) may explain partial hydrolysis of ADP-ribosylated acceptors with an increase in content of ADP-ribosylated substrates. Af1521 and ARH3 crystal structures with bound ADP-ribose revealed similar ADP-ribose-binding pockets with the catalytic residues of the ARH and macrodomain protein families in the N-terminal helix and loop. Although the biological roles of the ARHs and macrodomain proteins differ, they share enzymatic and structural properties that may regulate metabolites such as α-NAD<sup>+</sup>.	eng	2576	2584	ACS chemical biology	14	12	2019	Dec	20	D000074744;D000246/Q000378;D000818;D002384;D002478;D006801;D006868;D051379;D009243/Q000378	ADP-Ribosylation;Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism;Animals;Catalysis;Cells, Cultured;Humans;Hydrolysis;Mice;NAD/metabolism	Stevens LA;Kato J;Kasamatsu A;Oda H;Lee DY;Moss J	Journal, Articles					10.1021/acschembio.9b00429			False
1227	30587505	Toward a better understanding of folate metabolism in health and disease.	Folate metabolism is crucial for many biochemical processes, including purine and thymidine monophosphate (dTMP) biosynthesis, mitochondrial protein translation, and methionine regeneration. These biochemical processes in turn support critical cellular functions such as cell proliferation, mitochondrial respiration, and epigenetic regulation. Not surprisingly, abnormal folate metabolism has been causally linked with a myriad of diseases. In this review, we provide a historical perspective, delve into folate chemistry that is often overlooked, and point out various missing links and underdeveloped areas in folate metabolism for future exploration.	eng	253	266	The Journal of experimental medicine	216	2	2019	Feb	04	D000818;D049109;D044127;D005492/Q000378;D006801;D008715/Q000378;D008928/Q000378;D010101;D014176;D013938/Q000096	Animals;Cell Proliferation;Epigenesis, Genetic;Folic Acid/metabolism;Humans;Methionine/metabolism;Mitochondria/metabolism;Oxygen Consumption;Protein Biosynthesis;Thymidine Monophosphate/biosynthesis	Zheng Y;Cantley LC	Journal, Articles					10.1084/jem.20181965			False
1228	31125428	Characterization of mammalian glutaredoxin isoforms as S-denitrosylases.	Glutaredoxins (Grx) are involved in many reactions including defense against oxidative stress. However, the role of the Grx system under nitrosative stress has barely been investigated. In this study, we found that human Grxs denitrosylated both low and high molecular weight S-nitrosothiols. Some S-nitrosylated proteins, stable in the presence of a physiological concentration of glutathione (GSH), were denitrosylated by Grxs. Caspase 3 and cathepsin B were identified as substrates of Grx1-catalysed denitrosylation. In addition, mono-thiol Grxs, such as Grx5, exhibited denitrosylase activity coupled with GSH via a monothiol mechanism. Our study demonstrates the ability of Grxs to act as S-denitrosylases and pinpoint a new mechanism for denitrosylation.	eng	1799	1806	FEBS letters	593	14	2019	Jul		D053148/Q000378;D002401/Q000378;D054477/Q000378;D057809;D006706;D006801;D009569/Q000378;D010105/Q000378;D020033/Q000378;D015398	Caspase 3/metabolism;Cathepsin B/metabolism;Glutaredoxins/metabolism;HEK293 Cells;Homeostasis;Humans;Nitric Oxide/metabolism;Oxygenases/metabolism;Protein Isoforms/metabolism;Signal Transduction	Ren X;Sengupta R;Lu J;Lundberg JO;Holmgren A	Journal, Articles					10.1002/1873-3468.13454			False
1229	31126740	SLC19A1 Is an Importer of the Immunotransmitter cGAMP.	2'3'-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is a second messenger that activates the antiviral stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. We recently identified a novel role for cGAMP as a soluble, extracellular immunotransmitter that is produced and secreted by cancer cells. Secreted cGAMP is then sensed by host cells, eliciting an antitumoral immune response. Due to the antitumoral effects of cGAMP, other CDN-based STING agonists are currently under investigation in clinical trials for metastatic solid tumors. However, it is unknown how cGAMP and other CDNs cross the cell membrane to activate intracellular STING. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified SLC19A1 as the first known importer of cGAMP and other CDNs, including the investigational new drug 2'3'-bisphosphosphothioate-cyclic-di-AMP (2'3'-CDA<sup>S</sup>).

1230	30055235	DMT1 and iron transport.	Many past and recent advances in the field of iron metabolism have relied upon the discovery of divalent metal transporter 1, DMT1 in 1997. DMT1 is the major iron transporter and contributes non-heme iron uptake in most types of cell. Each DMT1 isoform exhibits different expression patterns in cell-type specificity and distinct subcellular distribution, which enables cells to uptake both transferrin-bound and non-transferrin-bound irons efficiently. DMT1 expression is regulated by iron through the translational and degradation pathways to ensure iron homeostasis. It is considered that mammalian iron transporters including DMT1 cannot transport ferric iron but ferrous iron. Being reduced to ferrous state is likely to damage cells and tissues through the production of reactive oxygen species. Recently, iron chaperones have been identified, which can provide an answer to how ferrous iron is transported safely in cytosol. We summarize DMT1 expression depending on the types of cell or tissue and the function and mechanism of one of the iron chaperones, PCBP2.	eng	55	63	Free radical biology & medicine	133		2019	Mar		D000818;D001692/Q000235;D027682/Q000235;D005786/Q000235;D006801;D017136/Q000235;D007501/Q000378;D018832/Q000235;D018832/Q000378;D020033/Q000235;D020033/Q000378;D016601/Q000235;D016601/Q000378;D014168/Q000235;D014168/Q000378	Animals;Biological Transport/genetics;Cation Transport Proteins/genetics;Gene Expression Regulation/genetics;Humans;Ion Transport/genetics;Iron/metabolism;Molecular Chaperones/genetics;Molecular Chaperones/metabolism;Protein Isoforms/genetics;Protein Isoforms/metabolism;RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics;RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism;Transferrin/genetics;Transferrin/metabolism	Yanatori I;Kishi F	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2018.07.020			False
1231	31649033	AKR1A1 is a novel mammalian <i>S</i>-nitroso-glutathione reductase.	Oxidative modification of Cys residues by NO results in <i>S</i>-nitrosylation, a ubiquitous post-translational modification and a primary mediator of redox-based cellular signaling. Steady-state levels of <i>S</i>-nitrosylated proteins are largely determined by denitrosylase enzymes that couple NAD(P)H oxidation with reduction of <i>S</i>-nitrosothiols, including protein and low-molecular-weight (LMW) <i>S</i>-nitrosothiols (<i>S</i>-nitroso-GSH (GSNO) and <i>S</i>-nitroso-CoA (SNO-CoA)). SNO-CoA reductases require NADPH, whereas enzymatic reduction of GSNO can involve either NADH or NADPH. Notably, GSNO reductase (GSNOR, <i>Adh5</i>) accounts for most NADH-dependent GSNOR activity, whereas NADPH-dependent GSNOR activity is largely unaccounted for (CBR1 mediates a minor portion). Here, we <i>de novo</i> purified NADPH-coupled GSNOR activity from mammalian tissues and identified aldo-keto reductase family 1 member A1 (AKR1A1), the archetypal mammalian SNO-CoA reductase, as a primary mediator of NADPH-coupled GSNOR activity in these tissues. Kinetic analyses suggested an AKR1A1 substrate preference of SNO-CoA > GSNO. AKR1A1 deletion from murine tissues dramatically lowered NADPH-dependent GSNOR activity. Conversely, GSNOR-deficient mice had increased AKR1A1 activity, revealing potential cross-talk among GSNO-dependent denitrosylases. Molecular modeling and mutagenesis of AKR1A1 identified Arg-312 as a key residue mediating the specific interaction with GSNO; in contrast, substitution of the SNO-CoA-binding residue Lys-127 minimally affected the GSNO-reducing activity of AKR1A1. Together, these findings indicate that AKR1A1 is a multi-LMW-SNO reductase that can distinguish between and metabolize the two major LMW-SNO signaling molecules GSNO and SNO-CoA, allowing for wide-ranging control of protein <i>S</i>-nitrosylation under both physiological and pathological conditions.	eng	18285	18293	The Journal of biological chemistry	294	48	2019	Nov	29	D000445/Q000235;D000445/Q000378;D000449/Q000235;D000449/Q000378;D000818;D003065/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D008322;D008810;D018345;D009249/Q000378;D009569/Q000378;D010084;D026403/Q000378;D015398	Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/genetics;Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/metabolism;Aldehyde Reductase/genetics;Aldehyde Reductase/metabolism;Animals;Coenzyme A/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Mammals;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Knockout;NADP/metabolism;Nitric Oxide/metabolism;Oxidation-Reduction;S-Nitrosothiols/metabolism;Signal Transduction	Stomberski CT;Anand P;Venetos NM;Hausladen A;Zhou HL;Premont RT;Stamler JS	Journal, Articles					10.1074/jbc.RA119.011067			False
1232	31511627	Metabolism and biochemical properties of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) analogs, nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD) and nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide (NHD).	Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an important coenzyme that regulates various metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, β-oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, NAD serves as a substrate for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), sirtuin, and NAD glycohydrolase, and it regulates DNA repair, gene expression, energy metabolism, and stress responses. Many studies have demonstrated that NAD metabolism is deeply involved in aging and aging-related diseases. Previously, we demonstrated that nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD) and nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide (NHD), which are analogs of NAD, are significantly increased in Nmnat3-overexpressing mice. However, there is insufficient knowledge about NGD and NHD in vivo. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the metabolism and biochemical properties of these NAD analogs. We demonstrated that endogenous NGD and NHD were found in various murine tissues, and their synthesis and degradation partially rely on Nmnat3 and CD38. We have also shown that NGD and NHD serve as coenzymes for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in vitro, although their affinity is much lower than that of NAD. On the other hand, NGD and NHD cannot be used as substrates for SIRT1, SIRT3, and PARP1. These results reveal the basic metabolism of NGD and NHD and also highlight their biological function as coenzymes.	eng	13102		Scientific reports	9	1	2019	Sep	11	D000375/Q000378;D000818;D006150/Q000096;D006150/Q000378;D006160/Q000378;D007293/Q000378;D051379;D009243/Q000031;D009243/Q000096;D009243/Q000378;D011065/Q000378;D037761/Q000378	Aging/metabolism;Animals;Guanine Nucleotides/biosynthesis;Guanine Nucleotides/metabolism;Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Inosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Mice;NAD/analogs & derivatives;NAD/biosynthesis;NAD/metabolism;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism;Sirtuins/metabolism	Yaku K;Okabe K;Gulshan M;Takatsu K;Okamoto H;Nakagawa T	Journal, Articles								False
1233	32846902	Chemical Reactivities of <i>ortho</i>-Quinones Produced in Living Organisms: Fate of Quinonoid Products Formed by Tyrosinase and Phenoloxidase Action on Phenols and Catechols.	Tyrosinase catalyzes the oxidation of phenols and catechols (<i>o</i>-diphenols) to <i>o</i>-quinones. The reactivities of <i>o</i>-quinones thus generated are responsible for oxidative browning of plant products, sclerotization of insect cuticle, defense reaction in arthropods, tunichrome biochemistry in tunicates, production of mussel glue, and most importantly melanin biosynthesis in all organisms. These reactions also form a set of major reactions that are of nonenzymatic origin in nature. In this review, we summarized the chemical fates of <i>o</i>-quinones. Many of the reactions of <i>o</i>-quinones proceed extremely fast with a half-life of less than a second. As a result, the corresponding quinone production can only be detected through rapid scanning spectrophotometry. Michael-1,6-addition with thiols, intramolecular cyclization reaction with side chain amino groups, and the redox regeneration to original catechol represent some of the fast reactions exhibited by <i>o</i>-quinones, while, nucleophilic addition of carboxyl group, alcoholic group, and water are mostly slow reactions. A variety of catecholamines also exhibit side chain desaturation through tautomeric quinone methide formation. Therefore, quinone methide tautomers also play a pivotal role in the fate of numerous <i>o</i>-quinones. Armed with such wide and dangerous reactivity, <i>o</i>-quinones are capable of modifying the structure of important cellular components especially proteins and DNA and causing severe cytotoxicity and carcinogenic effects. The reactivities of different <i>o</i>-quinones involved in these processes along with special emphasis on mechanism of melanogenesis are discussed.	eng			International journal of molecular sciences	21	17	2020	Aug	24	D000818;D016227/Q000737;D016227/Q000378;D002384;D002396/Q000737;D002396/Q000378;D006801;D015416;D053858;D014442/Q000378;D018384/Q000502;D010636/Q000737;D010636/Q000378;D011809/Q000737;D011809/Q000378	Animals;Benzoquinones/chemistry;Benzoquinones/metabolism;Catalysis;Catechols/chemistry;Catechols/metabolism;Humans;Maillard Reaction;Metabolic Networks and Pathways;Monophenol Monooxygenase/metabolism;Oxidative Stress/physiology;Phenols/chemistry;Phenols/metabolism;Quinones/chemistry;Quinones/metabolism	Ito S;Sugumaran M;Wakamatsu K	Journal, Articles								False

Nevertheless, under physiological conditions, many perform side-reactions at low rates, producing potentially toxic side-products. An increasing number of metabolite repair enzymes are being discovered that serve to eliminate these noncanonical metabolites. Some of these enzymes are extraordinarily conserved, and their deficiency can lead to diseases in humans or embryonic lethality in mice, indicating their central role in cellular metabolism. We discuss how metabolite repair enzymes eliminate glycolytic side-products and prevent negative interference within and beyond this core metabolic pathway. Extrapolating from the number of metabolite repair enzymes involved in glycolysis, hundreds more likely remain to be discovered that protect a wide range of metabolic pathways.	eng	228	243	Trends in biochemical sciences	45	3	2020	Mar		D000818;D004798/Q000378;D006019;D006801;D051379	Animals;Enzymes/metabolism;Glycolysis;Humans;Mice	Bommer GT;Van Schaftingen E;Veiga-da-Cunha M	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.tibs.2019.07.004			False
1235	32462112	MESH1 is a cytosolic NADPH phosphatase that regulates ferroptosis.	Critical to the bacterial stringent response is the rapid relocation of resources from proliferation toward stress survival through the respective accumulation and degradation of (p)ppGpp by RelA and SpoT homologues. While mammalian genomes encode MESH1, a homologue of the bacterial (p)ppGpp hydrolase SpoT, neither (p)ppGpp nor its synthetase has been identified in mammalian cells. Here, we show that human MESH1 is an efficient cytosolic NADPH phosphatase that facilitates ferroptosis. Visualization of the MESH1-NADPH crystal structure revealed a bona fide affinity for the NADPH substrate. Ferroptosis-inducing erastin or cystine deprivation elevates MESH1, whose overexpression depletes NADPH and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, whereas MESH1 depletion promotes ferroptosis survival by sustaining the levels of NADPH and GSH and by reducing lipid peroxidation. The ferroptotic protection by MESH1 depletion is ablated by suppression of the cytosolic NAD(H) kinase, NADK, but not its mitochondrial counterpart NADK2. Collectively, these data shed light on the importance of cytosolic NADPH levels and their regulation under ferroptosis-inducing conditions in mammalian cells.	eng	270	277	Nature metabolism	2	3	2020	Mar		D003600/Q000201;D000079403/Q000502;D006801;D009249/Q000378;D011755/Q000378	Cytosol/enzymology;Ferroptosis/physiology;Humans;NADP/metabolism;Pyrophosphatases/metabolism	Ding CC;Rose J;Sun T;Wu J;Chen PH;Lin CC;Yang WH;Chen KY;Lee H;Xu E;Tian S;Akinwuntan J;Zhao J;Guan Z;Zhou P;Chi JT	Journal, Articles					10.1038/s42255-020-0181-1			False
1236	32913139	Molecular Pharmacology of NRH:Quinone Oxidoreductase 2: A Detoxifying Enzyme Acting as an Undercover Toxifying Enzyme.	<i>N</i>-ribosyldihydronicotinamide:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2/QR2, Enzyme Commission number 1.10.99.2) is a cytosolic enzyme, abundant in the liver and variably expressed in mammalian tissues. Cloned 30 years ago, it was characterized as a flavoenzyme catalyzing the reduction of quinones and pseudoquinones. To do so, it uses exclusively <i>N</i>-alkyl nicotinamide derivatives, without being able to recognize NADH, the reference hydrure donor compound, in contrast to its next of a kind, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). For a long time both enzymes have been considered as key detoxifying enzymes in quinone metabolism, but more recent findings point to a more toxifying function of NQO2, particularly with respect to <i>ortho</i>-quinones. In fact, during the reduction of substrates, NQO2 generates fairly unstable intermediates that reoxidize immediately back to the original quinone, creating a futile cycle, the byproducts of which are deleterious reactive oxygen species. Beside this peculiarity, it is a target for numerous drugs and natural compounds such as melatonin, chloroquine, imiquimod, resveratrol, piceatannol, quercetin, and other flavonoids. Most of these enzyme-ligand interactions have been documented by numerous crystallographic studies, and now NQO2 is one of the best represented proteins in the structural biology database. Despite evidence for a causative role in several important diseases, the functional role of NQO2 remains poorly explored. In the present review, we aimed at detailing the main characteristics of NQO2 from a molecular pharmacology perspective. By drawing a clear border between facts and speculations, we hope to stimulate the future research toward a better understanding of this intriguing drug target. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Evidence is reviewed on the prevalent toxifying function of <i>N</i>-ribosyldihydronicotinamide:quinone oxidoreductase 2 while catalyzing the reduction of <i>ortho</i>-quinones such as dopamine quinone.

1237	32682077	Human ARMT1 structure and substrate specificity indicates that it is a DUF89 family damage-control phosphatase.	Metabolite damage control is a critical but poorly defined aspect of cellular biochemistry, which likely involves many of the so far functionally uncharacterized protein domain (domains of unknown function; DUFs). We have determined the crystal structure of the human DUF89 protein product of the C6ORF211 gene to 1.85 Å. The crystal structure shows that the protein contains a core α-β-α fold with an active site-bound metal ion and α-helical bundle N-terminal cap, which are both conserved features of subfamily III DUF89 domains. The biochemical activities of the human protein are conserved with those of a previously characterized budding yeast homolog, where an in vitro phosphatase activity is supported by divalent cations that include Co<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Full steady-state kinetics parameters of human DUF89 using a standard PNPP phosphatase assay revealed a six times higher catalytic efficiency in presence of Co<sup>2+</sup> compared to Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The human enzyme targets a number of phosphate substrates similar to the budding yeast homolog, while it lacks a previously indicated methyltransferase activity. The highest activity on substrate was observed with fructose-1-phosphate, a potent glycating agent, and thus human DUF89 phosphatase activity may also play a role in limiting the buildup of phospho-glycan species and their related damaged metabolites.	eng	107576		Journal of structural biology	212	1	2020	Oct	01	D001665/Q000502;D002384;D006801;D007700;D008670/Q000378;D010744/Q000378;D011134/Q000378;D011487;D011497/Q000378;D012441/Q000378;D013379/Q000502	Binding Sites/physiology;Catalysis;Humans;Kinetics;Metals/metabolism;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism;Polysaccharides/metabolism;Protein Conformation;Protein O-Methyltransferase/metabolism;Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism;Substrate Specificity/physiology	Dennis TN;Kenjić N;Kang AS;Lowenson JD;Kirkwood JS;Clarke SG;Perry JJP	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.jsb.2020.107576			False
1238	32946811	pH-Gated Succinate Secretion Regulates Muscle Remodeling in Response to Exercise.	In response to skeletal muscle contraction during exercise, paracrine factors coordinate tissue remodeling, which underlies this healthy adaptation. Here we describe a pH-sensing metabolite signal that initiates muscle remodeling upon exercise. In mice and humans, exercising skeletal muscle releases the mitochondrial metabolite succinate into the local interstitium and circulation. Selective secretion of succinate is facilitated by its transient protonation, which occurs upon muscle cell acidification. In the protonated monocarboxylic form, succinate is rendered a transport substrate for monocarboxylate transporter 1, which facilitates pH-gated release. Upon secretion, succinate signals via its cognate receptor SUCNR1 in non-myofibrillar cells in muscle tissue to control muscle-remodeling transcriptional programs. This succinate-SUCNR1 signaling is required for paracrine regulation of muscle innervation, muscle matrix remodeling, and muscle strength in response to exercise training. In sum, we define a bioenergetic sensor in muscle that utilizes intracellular pH and succinate to coordinate tissue adaptation to exercise.	eng	62	75.e17	Cell	183	1	2020	Oct	01	D000818;D006801;D006863;D007249/Q000378;D051379;D008928/Q000378;D027501/Q000378;D009119;D018482/Q000378;D043562/Q000378;D043562/Q000502;D015398;D013386/Q000378;D019802/Q000378;D027981/Q000378	Animals;Humans;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Inflammation/metabolism;Mice;Mitochondria/metabolism;Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters/metabolism;Muscle Contraction;Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism;Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/physiology;Signal Transduction;Succinates/metabolism;Succinic Acid/metabolism;Symporters/metabolism	Reddy A;Bozi LHM;Yaghi OK;Mills EL;Xiao H;Nicholson HE;Paschini M;Paulo JA;Garrity R;Laznik-Bogoslavski D;Ferreira JCB;Carl CS;Sjøberg KA;Wojtaszewski JFP;Jeppesen JF;Kiens B;Gygi SP;Richter EA;Mathis D;Chouchani ET	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.039			False
1239	33996761	Heterologous Expression and Biochemical Characterization of the Human Zinc Transporter 1 (ZnT1) and Its Soluble C-Terminal Domain.	Human zinc transporter 1 (hZnT1) belongs to the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family. It plays a major role in transporting zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) from the cytoplasm across the plasma membrane and into the extracellular space thereby protecting cells from Zn<sup>2+</sup> toxicity. Through homology with other CDF family members, ZnT1 is predicted to contain a transmembrane region and a soluble C-terminal domain though little is known about its biochemistry. Here, we demonstrate that human ZnT1 and a variant can be produced by heterologous expression in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> cells and purified in the presence of detergent and cholesteryl hemisuccinate. We show that the purified hZnT1 variant has Zn<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter activity. Furthermore, we expressed, purified and characterized the soluble C-terminal domain of hZnT1 (hZnT1-CTD) in a bacterial expression system. We found that the hZnT1-CTD melting temperature increases at acidic pH, thus, we used an acetate buffer at pH 4.5 for purifications and concentration of the protein up to 12 mg/mL. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of hZnT1-CTD is consistent with the formation of a dimer in solution with a V-shaped core.	eng	667803		Frontiers in chemistry	9		2021					Cotrim CA;Jarrott RJ;Whitten AE;Choudhury HG;Drew D;Martin JL	Journal, Articles								False
1240	33633837	Carbon dioxide transport across membranes.	Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) movement across cellular membranes is passive and governed by Fick's law of diffusion. Until recently, we believed that gases cross biological membranes exclusively by dissolving in and then diffusing through membrane lipid. However, the observation that some membranes are CO<sub>2</sub> impermeable led to the discovery of a gas molecule moving through a channel; namely, CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion through aquaporin-1 (AQP1). Later work demonstrated CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion through rhesus (Rh) proteins and NH<sub>3</sub> diffusion through both AQPs and Rh proteins. The tetrameric AQPs exhibit differential selectivity for CO<sub>2</sub> versus NH<sub>3</sub> versus H<sub>2</sub>O, reflecting physico-chemical differences among the small molecules as well as among the hydrophilic monomeric pores and hydrophobic central pores of various AQPs. Preliminary work suggests that NH<sub>3</sub> moves through the monomeric pores of AQP1, whereas CO<sub>2</sub> moves through both monomeric and central pores. Initial work on AQP5 indicates that it is possible to create a metal-binding site on the central pore's extracellular face, thereby blocking CO<sub>2</sub> movement. The trimeric Rh proteins have monomers with hydrophilic pores surrounding a hydrophobic central pore. Preliminary work on the bacterial Rh homologue AmtB suggests that gas can diffuse through the central pore and three sets of interfacial clefts between monomers. Finally, initial work indicates that CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses through the electrogenic Na/HCO<sub>3</sub> cotransporter NBCe1. At least in some cells, CO<sub>2</sub>-permeable proteins could provide important pathways for transmembrane CO<sub>2</sub> movements. Such pathways could be amenable to cellular regulation and could become valuable drug targets.	eng	20200090		Interface focus	11	2	2021	Apr	06			Michenkova M;Taki S;Blosser MC;Hwang HJ;Kowatz T;Moss FJ;Occhipinti R;Qin X;Sen S;Shinn E;Wang D;Zeise BS;Zhao P;Malmstadt N;Vahedi-Faridi A;Tajkhorshid E;Boron WF	Journal, Articles								False
1241	35950458	Structural Insights into Porphyrin Recognition by the Human ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter ABCB6.	"Human ABCB6 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that regulates heme biosynthesis by translocating various porphyrins from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human ABCB6 with its substrates, coproporphyrin III (CPIII) and hemin, at 3.5 and 3.7 Å resolution, respectively. Metalfree porphyrin CPIII binds to ABCB6 within the central cavity, where its propionic acids form hydrogen bonds with the highly conserved Y550. The resulting structure has an overall fold similar to the inward-facing apo structure, but the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are slightly closer to each other. In contrast, when ABCB6 binds a metal-centered porphyrin hemin in complex with two glutathione molecules (1 hemin: 2 glutathione), the two NBDs end up much closer together, aligning them to bind and hydrolyze ATP more efficiently. In our structures, a glycine-rich and highly flexible ""bulge"" loop on TM helix 7 undergoes significant conformational changes associated with substrate binding. Our findings suggest that ABCB6 utilizes at least two distinct mechanisms to fine-tune substrate specificity and transport efficiency."	eng	575	587	Molecules and cells	45	8	2022	Aug	31	D018528/Q000378;D000255/Q000378;D020285;D005978/Q000378;D006427/Q000378;D006801;D011166/Q000378	ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism;Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Cryoelectron Microscopy;Glutathione/metabolism;Hemin/metabolism;Humans;Porphyrins/metabolism	Kim S;Lee SS;Park JG;Kim JW;Ju S;Choi SH;Kim NJ;Hong S;Kang JY;Jin MS	Journal, Articles					10.14348/molcells.2022.0040			False
1242	36265513	Recognition of cyclic dinucleotides and folates by human SLC19A1.	Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) are ubiquitous signalling molecules in all domains of life<sup>1,2</sup>. Mammalian cells produce one CDN, 2'3'-cGAMP, through cyclic GMP-AMP synthase after detecting cytosolic DNA signals<sup>3-7</sup>. 2'3'-cGAMP, as well as bacterial and synthetic CDN analogues, can act as second messengers to activate stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and elicit broad downstream responses<sup>8-21</sup>. Extracellular CDNs must traverse the cell membrane to activate STING, a process that is dependent on the solute carrier SLC19A1<sup>22,23</sup>. Moreover, SLC19A1 represents the major transporter for folate nutrients and antifolate therapeutics<sup>24,25</sup>, thereby placing SLC19A1 as a key factor in multiple physiological and pathological processes. How SLC19A1 recognizes and transports CDNs, folate and antifolate is unclear. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human SLC19A1 (hSLC19A1) in a substrate-free state and in complexes with multiple CDNs from different sources, a predominant natural folate and a new-generation antifolate drug. The structural and mutagenesis results demonstrate that hSLC19A1 uses unique yet divergent mechanisms to recognize CDN- and folate-type substrates. Two CDN molecules bind within the hSLC19A1 cavity as a compact dual-molecule unit, whereas folate and antifolate bind as a monomer and occupy a distinct pocket of the cavity. Moreover, the structures enable accurate mapping and potential mechanistic interpretation of hSLC19A1 with loss-of-activity and disease-related mutations. Our research provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of SLC19-family transporters and is a foundation for the development of potential therapeutics.	eng	170	176	Nature	612	7938	2022	Dec		D000818;D006801;D020285;D015226/Q000378;D005492/Q000378;D005493/Q000494;D008322/Q000378;D009712/Q000378;D058978/Q000737;D058978/Q000235;D058978/Q000378;D058978/Q000648	Animals;Humans;Cryoelectron Microscopy;Dinucleoside Phosphates/metabolism;Folic Acid/metabolism;Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology;Mammals/metabolism;Nucleotides, Cyclic/metabolism;Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/chemistry;Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/genetics;Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/metabolism;Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/ultrastructure	Zhang Q;Zhang X;Zhu Y;Sun P;Zhang L;Ma J;Zhang Y;Zeng L;Nie X;Gao Y;Li Z;Liu S;Lou J;Gao A;Gao P	Journal, Articles					10.1038/s41586-022-05452-z			False
1243	36589890	Stable Isotopomers of <i>myo-</i>Inositol Uncover a Complex MINPP1-Dependent Inositol Phosphate Network.	The water-soluble inositol phosphates (InsPs) represent a functionally diverse group of small-molecule messengers involved in a myriad of cellular processes. Despite their centrality, our understanding of human InsP metabolism is incomplete because the available analytical toolset to characterize and quantify InsPs in complex samples is limited. Here, we have synthesized and applied symmetrically and unsymmetrically <sup>13</sup>C-labeled <i>myo</i>-inositol and inositol phosphates. These probes were utilized in combination with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS) to investigate InsP metabolism in human cells. The labeling strategy provided detailed structural information via NMR-down to individual enantiomers-which overcomes a crucial blind spot in the analysis of InsPs. We uncovered a novel branch of InsP dephosphorylation in human cells which is dependent on MINPP1, a phytase-like enzyme contributing to cellular homeostasis. Detailed characterization of MINPP1 activity in vitro and in cells showcased the unique reactivity of this phosphatase. Our results demonstrate that metabolic labeling with stable isotopomers in conjunction with NMR spectroscopy and CE-MS constitutes a powerful tool to annotate InsP networks in a variety of biological contexts.	eng	1683	1694	ACS central science	8	12	2022	Dec	28			Nguyen Trung M;Kieninger S;Fandi Z;Qiu D;Liu G;Mehendale NK;Saiardi A;Jessen H;Keller B;Fiedler D	Journal, Articles					10.1021/acscentsci.2c01032			False
1244	35209187	Using Steady-State Kinetics to Quantitate Substrate Selectivity and Specificity: A Case Study with Two Human Transaminases.	We examined the ability of two human cytosolic transaminases, aspartate aminotransferase (GOT1) and alanine aminotransferase (GPT), to transform their preferred substrates whilst discriminating against similar metabolites. This offers an opportunity to survey our current understanding of enzyme selectivity and specificity in a biological context. Substrate selectivity can be quantitated based on the ratio of the <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i>/<i>K<sub>M</sub></i> values for two alternative substrates (the 'discrimination index'). After assessing the advantages, implications and limits of this index, we analyzed the reactions of GOT1 and GPT with alternative substrates that are metabolically available and show limited structural differences with respect to the preferred substrates. The transaminases' observed selectivities were remarkably high. In particular, GOT1 reacted ~10<sup>6</sup>-fold less efficiently when the side-chain carboxylate of the 'physiological' substrates (aspartate and glutamate) was replaced by an amido group (asparagine and glutamine). This represents a current empirical limit of discrimination associated with this chemical difference. The structural basis of GOT1 selectivity was addressed through substrate docking simulations, which highlighted the importance of electrostatic interactions and proper substrate positioning in the active site. We briefly discuss the biological implications of these results and the possibility of using <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i>/<i>K<sub>M</sub></i> values to derive a global measure of enzyme specificity.	eng			Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)	27	4	2022	Feb	18	D019883/Q000737;D019883/Q000378;D000596/Q000737;D000818;D001665;D002417;D004789;D006801;D007700;D008958;D011487;D013329;D013379;D000637/Q000737;D000637/Q000378;D017855/Q000737;D017855/Q000378	Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/chemistry;Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/metabolism;Amino Acids/chemistry;Animals;Binding Sites;Cattle;Enzyme Activation;Humans;Kinetics;Models, Molecular;Protein Conformation;Structure-Activity Relationship;Substrate Specificity;Transaminases/chemistry;Transaminases/metabolism;Transferases (Other Substituted Phosphate Groups)/chemistry;Transferases (Other Substituted Phosphate Groups)/metabolism	Peracchi A;Polverini E	Journal, Articles								False
1245	35710135	Acylcarnitines: Nomenclature, Biomarkers, Therapeutic Potential, Drug Targets, and Clinical Trials.	Acylcarnitines are fatty acid metabolites that play important roles in many cellular energy metabolism pathways. They have historically been used as important diagnostic markers for inborn errors of fatty acid oxidation and are being intensively studied as markers of energy metabolism, deficits in mitochondrial and peroxisomal <b><i>β</i></b> -oxidation activity, insulin resistance, and physical activity. Acylcarnitines are increasingly being identified as important indicators in metabolic studies of many diseases, including metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, depression, neurologic disorders, and certain cancers. The US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug L-carnitine, along with short-chain acylcarnitines (acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine), is now widely used as a dietary supplement. In light of their growing importance, we have undertaken an extensive review of acylcarnitines and provided a detailed description of their identity, nomenclature, classification, biochemistry, pathophysiology, supplementary use, potential drug targets, and clinical trials. We also summarize these updates in the Human Metabolome Database, which now includes information on the structures, chemical formulae, chemical/spectral properties, descriptions, and pathways for 1240 acylcarnitines. This work lays a solid foundation for identifying, characterizing, and understanding acylcarnitines in human biosamples. We also discuss the emerging opportunities for using acylcarnitines as biomarkers and as dietary interventions or supplements for many wide-ranging indications. The opportunity to identify new drug targets involved in controlling acylcarnitine levels is also discussed. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This review provides a comprehensive overview of acylcarnitines, including their nomenclature, structure and biochemistry, and use as disease biomarkers and pharmaceutical agents. We present updated information contained in the Human Metabolome Database website as well as substantial mapping of the known biochemical pathways associated with acylcarnitines, thereby providing a strong foundation for further clarification of their physiological roles.	eng	506	551	Pharmacological reviews	74	3	2022	Jul		D015415;D002331/Q000031;D002331/Q000737;D002331/Q000378;D002331/Q000627;D005227/Q000378;D006801;D007333/Q000502	Biomarkers;Carnitine/analogs & derivatives;Carnitine/chemistry;Carnitine/metabolism;Carnitine/therapeutic use;Fatty Acids/metabolism;Humans;Insulin Resistance/physiology	Dambrova M;Makrecka-Kuka M;Kuka J;Vilskersts R;Nordberg D;Attwood MM;Smesny S;Sen ZD;Guo AC;Oler E;Tian S;Zheng J;Wishart DS;Liepinsh E;Schiöth HB	Journal, Articles					10.1124/pharmrev.121.000408			False
1246	35834009	Human cytosolic transaminases: side activities and patterns of discrimination towards physiologically available alternative substrates.	Transaminases play key roles in central metabolism, transferring the amino group from a donor substrate to an acceptor. These enzymes can often act, with low efficiency, on compounds different from the preferred substrates. To understand what might have shaped the substrate specificity of this class of enzymes, we examined the reactivity of six human cytosolic transaminases towards amino acids whose main degradative pathways do not include any transamination. We also tested whether sugars and sugar phosphates could serve as alternative amino group acceptors for these cytosolic enzymes. Each of the six aminotransferases reacted appreciably with at least three of the alternative amino acid substrates in vitro, albeit at usually feeble rates. Reactions with L-Thr, L-Arg, L-Lys and L-Asn were consistently very slow-a bias explained in part by the structural differences between these amino acids and the preferred substrates of the transaminases. On the other hand, L-His and L-Trp reacted more efficiently, particularly with GTK (glutamine transaminase K; also known as KYAT1). This points towards a role of GTK in the salvage of L-Trp (in cooperation with ω-amidase and possibly with the cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, MDH1, which efficiently reduced the product of L-Trp transamination). Finally, the transaminases were extremely ineffective at utilizing sugars and sugar derivatives, with the exception of the glycolytic intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which was slowly but appreciably transaminated by some of the enzymes to yield serinol phosphate. Evidence for the formation of this compound in a human cell line was also obtained. We discuss the biological and evolutionary implications of our results.	eng	421		Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS	79	8	2022	Jul	14	D000596;D003600/Q000378;D006801;D007700;D013379;D000073893;D000637/Q000378	Amino Acids;Cytosol/metabolism;Humans;Kinetics;Substrate Specificity;Sugars;Transaminases/metabolism	Caligiore F;Zangelmi E;Vetro C;Kentache T;Dewulf JP;Veiga-da-Cunha M;Van Schaftingen E;Bommer G;Peracchi A	Journal, Articles								False
1247	35147247	The Mineralization Regulator ANKH Mediates Cellular Efflux of ATP, Not Pyrophosphate.	The plasma membrane protein ankylosis homologue (ANKH, mouse ortholog: Ank) prevents pathological mineralization of joints by controlling extracellular levels of the mineralization inhibitor pyrophosphate (PPi). It was long thought that ANKH acts by transporting PPi into the joints. We recently showed that when overproduced in HEK293 cells, ANKH mediates release of large amounts of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), predominantly ATP, into the culture medium. ATP is converted extracellularly into PPi and AMP by the ectoenzyme ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1). We could not rule out, however, that cells also release PPi directly via ANKH. We now addressed the question of whether PPi leaves cells via ANKH using HEK293 cells that completely lack ENPP1. Introduction of ANKH in these ENPP1-deficient HEK293 cells resulted in robust cellular ATP release without the concomitant increase in extracellular PPi found in ENPP1-proficient cells. Ank activity was previously shown to be responsible for about 75% of the PPi found in mouse bones. However, bones of Enpp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice contained <2.5% of the PPi found in bones of wild-type mice, showing that Enpp1 activity is also a prerequisite for Ank-dependent PPi incorporation into the mineralized bone matrix in vivo. Hence, ATP release precedes ENPP1-mediated PPi formation. We find that ANKH also provides about 25% of plasma PPi, whereas we have previously shown that 60% to 70% of plasma PPi is derived from the NTPs extruded by the ABC transporter, ABCC6. Both transporters that keep plasma PPi at sufficient levels to prevent pathological calcification therefore do so by extruding NTPs rather than PPi itself. © 2022 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).	eng	1024	1031	Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research	37	5	2022	May		D000255/Q000378;D000818;D001842/Q000378;D001842/Q000473;D002113;D002114/Q000378;D002114/Q000473;D011756/Q000378;D057809;D006801;D051379;D028061/Q000378	Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism;Animals;Bone and Bones/metabolism;Bone and Bones/pathology;Calcification, Physiologic;Calcinosis/metabolism;Calcinosis/pathology;Diphosphates/metabolism;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Mice;Phosphate Transport Proteins/metabolism	Szeri F;Niaziorimi F;Donnelly S;Fariha N;Tertyshnaia M;Patel D;Lundkvist S;van de Wetering K	Journal, Articles					10.1002/jbmr.4528			False
1248	36070769	ABCC1 transporter exports the immunostimulatory cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP.	"The DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is important for antiviral and anti-tumor immunity. cGAS generates cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), a diffusible cyclic dinucleotide that activates the antiviral response through the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING). cGAMP cannot passively cross cell membranes, but recent advances have established a role for extracellular cGAMP as an ""immunotransmitter"" that can be imported into cells. However, the mechanism by which cGAMP exits cells remains unknown. Here, we identifed ABCC1 as a direct, ATP-dependent cGAMP exporter in mouse and human cells. We show that ABCC1 overexpression enhanced cGAMP export and limited STING signaling and that loss of ABCC1 reduced cGAMP export and potentiated STING signaling. We demonstrate that ABCC1 deficiency exacerbated cGAS-dependent autoimmunity in the Trex1<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Thus, ABCC1-mediated cGAMP export is a key regulatory mechanism that limits cell-intrinsic activation of STING and ameliorates STING-dependent autoimmune disease."	eng	1799	1812.e4	Immunity	55	10	2022	Oct	11	D000255;D000818;D004247/Q000378;D006801;D007372/Q000378;D026901/Q000235;D026901/Q000378;D051379;D027425/Q000235;D027425/Q000378;D009712/Q000378;D009713/Q000235;D009713/Q000378	Adenosine Triphosphate;Animals;DNA/metabolism;Humans;Interferons/metabolism;Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics;Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism;Mice;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics;Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism;Nucleotides, Cyclic/metabolism;Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics;Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism	Maltbaek JH;Cambier S;Snyder JM;Stetson DB	Journal, Articles					10.1016/j.immuni.2022.08.006			False
1249	37137720	METTL7A (TMT1A) and METTL7B (TMT1B) Are Responsible for Alkyl <i>S</i>-Thiol Methyl Transferase Activity in Liver.	<i>S</i>-methylation of drugs containing thiol-moieties often alters their activity and results in detoxification. Historically, scientists attributed methylation of exogenous aliphatic and phenolic thiols to a putative <i>S</i>-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent membrane-associated enzyme referred to as thiol methyltransferase (TMT). This putative TMT appeared to have a broad substrate specificity and methylated the thiol metabolite of spironolactone, mertansine, ziprasidone, captopril, and the active metabolites of the thienopyridine prodrugs, clopidogrel, and prasugrel. Despite TMT's role in the <i>S</i>-methylation of clinically relevant drugs, the enzyme(s) responsible for this activity remained unknown. We recently identified methyltransferase-like protein 7B (METTL7B) as an alkyl thiol methyltransferase. METTL7B is an endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein with similar biochemical properties and substrate specificity to the putative TMT. Yet, the historic TMT inhibitor 2,3-dichloro-<i>α</i>-methylbenzylamine (DCMB) did not inhibit METTL7B, indicating that multiple enzymes contribute to TMT activity. Here we report that methyltransferase-like protein 7A (METTL7A), an uncharacterized member of the METTL7 family, is also a SAM-dependent thiol methyltransferase. METTL7A exhibits similar biochemical properties to METTL7B and putative TMT, including inhibition by DCMB (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.17 <i>μ</i>M). Applying quantitative proteomics to human liver microsomes and gene modulation experiments in HepG2 and HeLa cells, we determined that TMT activity correlates closely with METTL7A and METTL7B protein levels. Furthermore, purification of a novel His-GST-tagged recombinant protein and subsequent activity experiments prove that METTL7A can selectively methylate exogenous thiol-containing substrates, including 7<i>α</i>-thiospironolactone, dithiothreitol, 4-chlorothiophenol, and mertansine. We conclude that the METTL7 family encodes for two enzymes, METTL7A and METTL7B, which are now renamed thiol methyltransferase 1A (TMT1A) and thiol methyltransferase 1B (TMT1B), respectively, that are responsible for thiol methylation activity in human liver microsomes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We identified methyltransferase-like protein 7A (thiol methyltransferase 1A) and methyltransferase-like protein 7B (thiol methyltransferase 1B) as the enzymes responsible for the microsomal alkyl thiol methyltransferase (TMT) activity. These are the first two enzymes directly associated with microsomal TMT activity. <i>S</i>-methylation of commonly prescribed thiol-containing drugs alters their pharmacological activity and/or toxicity, and identifying the enzymes responsible for this activity will improve our understanding of the drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) properties of alkyl- or phenolic thiol-containing therapeutics.	eng	1024	1034	Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals	51	8	2023	Aug		D006801;D006367;D008780/Q000378;D008099/Q000378;D011994;D013438	Humans;HeLa Cells;Methyltransferases/metabolism;Liver/metabolism;Recombinant Proteins;Sulfhydryl Compounds	Russell DA;Chau MK;Shi Y;Levasseur IN;Maldonato BJ;Totah RA	Journal, Articles					10.1124/dmd.123.001268			False
1250	36630448	SOD1 is an essential H<sub>2</sub>S detoxifying enzyme.	Although hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an endogenous signaling molecule with antioxidant properties, it is also cytotoxic by potently inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase and mitochondrial respiration. Paradoxically, the primary route of H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification is thought to occur inside the mitochondrial matrix <i>via</i> a series of relatively slow enzymatic reactions that are unlikely to compete with its rapid inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase. Therefore, alternative or complementary cellular mechanisms of H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification are predicted to exist. Here, superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] (SOD1) is shown to be an efficient H<sub>2</sub>S oxidase that has an essential role in limiting cytotoxicity from endogenous and exogenous sulfide. Decreased SOD1 expression resulted in increased sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity in yeast and human cells, while increased SOD1 expression enhanced tolerance to H<sub>2</sub>S. SOD1 rapidly converted H<sub>2</sub>S to sulfate under conditions of limiting sulfide; however, when sulfide was in molar excess, SOD1 catalyzed the formation of per- and polysulfides, which induce cellular thiol oxidation. Furthermore, in SOD1-deficient cells, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species catalyzed sulfide oxidation to per- and polysulfides. These data reveal that a fundamental function of SOD1 is to regulate H<sub>2</sub>S and related reactive sulfur species.	eng	e2205044120		Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	120	3	2023	Jan	17	D006801;D003576/Q000378;D006862/Q000378;D006862/Q000633;D013440/Q000378;D013482/Q000235;D013482/Q000378;D000072105/Q000235;D000072105/Q000378;D012441/Q000378;D029701/Q000378	Humans;Electron Transport Complex IV/metabolism;Hydrogen Sulfide/metabolism;Hydrogen Sulfide/toxicity;Sulfides/metabolism;Superoxide Dismutase/genetics;Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism;Superoxide Dismutase-1/genetics;Superoxide Dismutase-1/metabolism;Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism;Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/metabolism	Switzer CH;Kasamatsu S;Ihara H;Eaton P	Journal, Articles								False
