# RBC-GEM data/external

This directory contains `.zip` files for various publications and unmodified supplemental files assoicated with datasets used in working with the RBC-GEM reconstruction. 

Even publications and their associated data may be unavailable over time (e.g., change to URL for a database). Archiving the relevant publications and publically available helps alleviate these difficulties. 

All data in here is only for academic purposes. Respective publications for data should be cited if used.
